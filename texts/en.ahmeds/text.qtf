By God's Name, the Merciful, the Merciful/Most Merciful .
The gratitude/thanks/praise to God, the creation's altogether's/(universe's) Lord.
The merciful, the merciful/most merciful.
Owner/possessor (of) the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day .
(Only) You we worship, and (only) You we seek help from .
Guide us (to) the way/road, the straight/direct .
(The) way/road (of) those You blessed on them, not (those) the angered on them, and nor the misguided.
AL M
That The Book no doubt/suspicion in it, (it is) guidance to the fearing and obeying.
Those who believe with the unseen/hidden and they keep up/call for the prayers and from what We provided for them they spend.
And those who believe with what was descended to you, and what was descended from before you, and with the end (other life) they are sure/certain .
Those are on a guidance from their Lord and those are the successful/winners.
That those who disbelieved, (it is) equal/alike on (to) them, had you warned them , or you did not warn them, (notice) they do not believe.
God sealed/stamped on their hearts/minds and on their hearing and on their eye sights/understanding a cover and for them (is) a great torture.
And from the people who say: "We believed by God and with the Day the Last/ Resurrection Day." And they are not with believing.
They deceive God, and those who believed, and they do not deceive except themselves, and they do not feel/know/sense.
In their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease, so God increased them sickness/disease, and for them (is a) painful torture because (of) what they were lying/denying/falsifying .
And if (it was) said to them: "Do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth." They said: "But we are correcting/repairing ."
Is it not that they truly are, they are the corrupting and but they do not feel/know/sense?
And if (it was/is) said to them: "Believe as the people believed." They said: "Do we believe as the ignorant/foolish believed?" Is it not that they truly are, they are the ignorant/foolish and but they do not know?
And if they met/found those who believed, they said: "We believed". And if they were alone/together with to their devils they said: "That we are with you, but we are mocking ."
God moc ks with (about) them and extends/spreads them in their tyranny (being) confused/puzzled.
Those are those who bought/volunteered the misguidance with the guidance, so their commercial trade/buying and selling did not profit/gain, and they were not guided.
Their example (is) as the one who ignited a fire, so when it lit/illuminated what (is) around/surrounding him, God took/went away with their light, and left them in darknesses, they do not see/understand .
Deaf, mute, blind , so they do not return.
Or as a rain from the sky, in it (is) darknesses and thunder and lightning, they put their fingers intheir ears from the thunderous noise , fearing the death , and God (is) with the disbelievers surrounding/enveloping .
The lightning almost snatches their eye sights , whenever (it) lit for them they walked in it, and if (it) darkened on them they stood and if God willed/wanted, He would have gone/taken away with their hearing/sense of hearing , and their sights/understanding , that God (is) on every thing capable/powerful .
You, you the people worship your Lord who created you, and those from before you, maybe/perhaps you fear and obey (God).
Who made/created for you the earth/Planet Earth a spread , and the sky/space a structure and descended from the sky water, so He brought out with it from the fruits a provision for you, so do not make/create to God equals (idols) and you are knowing.
And if you were in doubt/suspicion from what We descended on Our worshipper/slave , so come/bring with a chapter from its similar/equal/alike to it, and call your witnesses/testifiers from other than God, if you were truthful.
So if you do not make/do and you will never make/do, so fear the fire, that/which its fuel (is) the people and the stones, (it) was/is prepared to the disbelievers.
And announce good news (to) those who believe and did/made the correct/righteous deeds, that to them (are) treed gardens the rivers flow from beneath it. Whenever they (were) provided for from it from a fruit a provision ,they said: "This (is) what we were provided for from before." And they were given with it similar , and for them in it (are) purified spouses and they are in it immortally/eternally .
That God does not (feel) shame that (He) gives/strikes an example , (of) any a mosquito (and) so what (is) above it, so but those who believed, so they know that it (is) the truth from their Lord, and but those who disbelieved, so they say: "What did God want/intend with that (as) an example/proverb?" He misguides with it many, and He guides with it many, and He does not misguide with it except the debauchers .
Those who break God's promise/contract (their promise to God) from after its affirmation , and they cut/sever what God ordered with it that (it) be reached/connected , and they corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth, those they are the losers.
How do you disbelieve with God and you were deads, so He revived you, then He makes you die, then He revives you , then to Him you are being returned.
He (is), who created for you what (is) in the land/earth/Planet Earth all together/wholly , then He tended to the sky/space, so He straightened them (into) seven skies/space(s), and He is with every thing knowledgeable.
And when your Lord said to the angels: "That I am making/creating/putting in the earth a caliph/successor/leader ." They said: "Do you make/create/put in it, who corrupts in it and sheds the blood, and we praise/glorify with Your praise and we (continue to admit Your) holiness/sanctity to You." He said: "I know what you do not know."
And He taught Adam the names, all of them, then He displayed/exhibited/showed them on (to) the angels, so He said: "Inform Me with (the) names (of) those, if you were truthful."
They said: "Your praise/glory , no knowledge to us except what You taught us , that You are the knowledgeable, the wise/judicious ."
He said: "You, Adam, inform them with their names." so when he informed them with their names, He (God) said: "Did I not say to you, that I know the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's unseen and I know what you show, and what you were hiding/concealing."
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam." So they prostrated except Satan , he refused/hated and became arrogant, and he was from the disbelievers.
And We said: "You Adam, reside/inhabit you and your wife/spouse the Paradise/treed garden, and you (B) eat from it easily/comfortably where/when you (B) wanted, and do not approach/near (B) this the tree, so you (B) become from the unjust/oppressors."
So the devil made them (B) slip/fall/sin from it, so he brought them (B) out from what they were (B) in it, and We said: "Descend/decline some of you to some (are) an enemy and for you in the earth/Planet Earth (is) settlement and long life/enjoyment to a time ."
So Adam received from his Lord words/expressions, so (He) forgave on him, that He is, He is the forgiver , the most merciful .
We said: "Drop/decline from it, all together , so when a guidance from Me comes to you, so who followed My guidance, so no fear/fright on them and nor they be sad/grieving."
And those who disbelieved and denied with Our verses/evidences , those are the fire's owners/company, they (are) in it immortally/eternally .
You Israel's sons and daughters , remember My blessing , which I blessed on you, and fulfill/complete with My promise/contract , I fulfill/complete with your promise/contract , and (only) Me so be terrified/monkish of Me .
And believe with what I descended, confirming to what (is) with you, and do not be (the) first disbeliever with it, and do not buy/volunteer with My verses/evidences a small/little price, and (only) Me, so fear and obey Me.
And do not confuse/mix/cover the correct/truth with the falsehood, and you hide/conceal the correct/truth and you are knowing.
And keep up/take care of the prayers and give/bring the charity/purification and bow with the bowing.
Do you order the people with the righteousness/charitability and you forget yourselves, and you are reading/reciting The Book , do you not reason/understand/comprehend?
And seek support with the patience and the prayers and that it truly is a great/burden (E) except on the humble .
Those who suppose/think that they are meeting their lord and that they are to Him returning.
You Israel's sons and daughters, mention/remember My blessing that I blessed on you, and that I preferred/favoured you on the creations altogether/(universes) .
And fear a day/time, no self rewards/substitutes from a self a thing, and no mediation (is to) be accepted/received from it, and no ransom/redemption (is to) be taken from it, and nor they be given victory .
And when/where We saved/rescued you, from Pharaoh's family, they burden/impose upon you (with) the torture's evil (worst), they slaughter your sons and they shame your women, and in that (is) a great test from your Lord.
And when/where We separated with you the sea , so We saved/rescued you, and We drowned/sunk Pharaoh's people and (while) you are looking/watching .
And when/where We promised Moses forty nights, then you took the calf from after him, and you are unjust/oppressive.
Then We forgave on you from after that, maybe you thank/be grateful.
And when We gave Moses The Book and the Separator of Right and Wrong , maybe you (will) be guided.
And when Moses said to his nation: "You my nation, that you caused injustice to yourselves, because (of) your taking the calf (to worship), so repent to your creator , so fight/kill yourselves, that is best for you at your creator ." So, He forgave on you, that He is the forgiver , the most merciful .
And when you said: "You, Moses, we will never believe to you until we see God openly , so the death/cry of torture took/punished you, and you are looking/watching .
Then We revived/resurrected you from after your death/lifelessness , maybe you thank/be grateful.
And We overshadowed on you the clouds , and We descended on you the mana (sweet gluey substance) and the quails/amusement . Eat from (the) goodness (of) what We provided for you , and they did not cause injustice to Us, and but they were (to) themselves causing injustice.
And when We said: "Enter this village/urban city, so eat from it where/when you willed/wanted easily/comfortably and enter the door/entrance prostrating and say humility/forgiveness (be humble) ,We (will) forgive for you your sins/wrongs/mistakes , and We will increase the good doers .
Those who caused injustice/oppression , so (they) exchanged/replaced a saying other than what was said to them, so We descended on those who caused injustice/oppression, filth/torture from the sky/space with what they were debauching .
And when Moses asked for drink for his nation, so We said: "Hit/move/palpitate with your stick/cane the stone, so twelve water springs/wells burst/flowed from it, each people had known their drinking place. Eat and drink from God's provision and do not corrupt in the Earth/land corrupting/disordering ."
And when you said: "You Moses, (we) will never be patient on one food, so call for us your lord (to) bring out for us from what the Earth/land sprouts/grows from its vegetables , and its long cucumber , and its legumes , and its lentils and its onions ." He said: "Do you exchange/substitute what it isnearer/weaker/poorer with what it is good/best ? Descend/enter (to the) city/border/region/Egypt , so for you (there is) what you asked/demanded." And it is imposed/forced on them the humiliation/disgrace and the poverty/ oppression and they returned/resided with anger from God, (that is) because they were disbelieving with God's signs/verses/evidences , and (they) kill the prophets without the right , that (is) because (of) what they disobeyed, and they were transgressing/violating .
That those who believed and those who repented/guided/Jews , and the Christians and the Sabians/converts , who believed with God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so for them their reward (is) at their lord, and no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving.
And when We took your promise/covenant , and We raised above you the mountain , take/receive what We gave you with strength/power , and mention/remember what (is) in it, maybe you fear and obey (God).
Then you turned away from after that, so where it not for God's grace/favour on you, and His mercy , you would have been from the losers
And you had known those who transgressed/violated from you in the Saturday/Sabbath, so We said to them: "Be lowly/ousted out monkeys/apes ."
So We made it (a) severe exemplary punishment for what (is) between its hands and what (is) behind it, and (an) advice/warning , to the fearing and obeying.
And when Moses said to his nation: "That God orders/commands you that you slaughter a cow." They said: "Do you take us mockingly ?" He said: "I seek protection by God that I be from the lowly/ignorant."
They said: "Call for us your Lord He clarifies for us what it is." He (Moses) said: "That He says that it is a cow not (an) old aged animal , and nor first born/virgin , middle aged between that, so make/do what you are ordered/commanded."
They said: "Call for us your Lord, (to) clarify for us what its colour (is)." He said: "That He says, that it truly is a cow, yellowish , clear pure bright yellow its colour, it delights the lookers."
They said: "Call for us your Lord He clarifies to us what it is, that the cows looked alike/resembled (each other) , on (to) us and that we are if God willed/wanted guided (E)."
He said: "That He says that it is a cow not manipulated/eased , it ploughs the earth, and does not water/irrigate the agricultural land/plants flawless, no marks/different colours in it." They said: "Now, you came with the truth/fact " So they slaughtered it , and they were not about to make/do (it).
And when you (P) killed a self, so you repelled (accusations amongst yourselves) in it, and God (is) bringing out what you were hiding/concealing.
So We said: "Mix/strike it with some of it." Like that God revives/makes alive the deads and He shows you His signs/verses/examples , maybe you reason/understand/comprehend
Then your hearts/minds became cruel/merciless from after that, so it is as the stones or stronger cruelty/mercilessness, and that from the stones (E) what the rivers bursts/flows from it and that from it (E) what splits/cracks so the water comes out of it, and that from it (E) what drops/reduces from God's fear, andGod (is) not with ignoring/disregarding from what you are doing/making.
Do you covet that they believe to you, and (there) had been a group/party from them (that) was hearing God's speech/conversation (words), then they alter/distort/change it from after what they understood/comprehended it , and they know?
And if they met those who believed, they said: "We believed." And if some of them (were) together to (with) some, they said: "Do you tell/inform them with what God taught on (to) you? To argue with you with it at your Lord." Do you not reason/understand ?
Are they not knowing that God knows what they keep secret and what they declare/publicize ?
And from them (are) illiterates/belonging to a nation they do not know The Book except (as) wishes/desires/lies and that they are except assuming/ supposing .
So grief/distress/woe (expression) to those who write The Book with their hands then they say: "That (it is) from at God." To buy/volunteer with it a small price, so grief/distress/woe (expression) to them from what their hands wrote , and grief/distress/woe (expression) to them from what they gather/acquire .
And they said: "The fire will never touch us except counted/numbered days/times." Say: "Did you take at God a promise/contract , so God will not break His promise/contract , or are you saying on God what you do not know?"
Yes/certainly , who gathered/earned a sin/crime, and his sin/mistake surrounded/enveloped with him so those (are) the fire's owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally.
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, those are the Paradise's owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally.
And when We took Israel's sons' and daughters' promise/covenant, "Do not worship except God, and with the parents a goodness and of the relations/near , and the orphans and the poorest of the poor/poor oppressed , and say to the people goodness, and keep up/take care of the prayers and give/bring the charity/purification." Then you turned away except (a) few from you and you are objecting/opposing .
And when We took your promise/covenant. "Do not shed your blood and do not bring yourselves out from your homes/countries , then you acknowledged/accepted and you (are) witnessing/testifying.
Then you are those who you kill yourselves and you force out a group/part from you, from their homes/countries, you cooperate/support on (against) them with the sin/crime and the transgression/injustice/aggression and if they come to you captives/prisoners you ransom them , and it is forbidden on you bringing/forcing them out. Do you believe with some/part (of) The Book and you disbelieve with some/part? So but (what is the) reward/reimbursement (of) who does that from you, except shame/scandal/disgrace in the life the present/worldly life (on) and the Resurrection Day they be returned to the torture's strongest (severest), and God (is) not with ignoring/disregarding on what you make/do.
Those are these who bought/volunteered the life the present/worldly life with the end (other life), so the torture is not to be lightened/reduced on them, and nor they be given victory.
And We had given/brought Moses The Book and We sent from after him with the messengers, and Wegave/brought Jesus Mary's son, the evidences and We supported him with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit , so if whenever a messenger came to you with what yourselves do not desire you become arrogant, so a group you denied and a group you kill .
And they said: "Our hearts/minds (are) covered/uncomprehending ." But God cursed them with their disbelief, so little/few (are) what they believe.
And when a Book came to them from at God, confirming to what (is) with them and they were from before judging/asking on those who disbelieved, so when what they knew came to them, they disbelieved with it, so God's curse/torture (is) on the disbelievers.
How bad (it is what), they bought/volunteered with it themselves, that they disbelieve with what God descended, corrupting/transgressing that God descends from His grace/favour on whom He wants/wills from His worshippers/slaves, so they returned/resided with anger on anger, and to the disbelievers (is) a humiliating torture.
And if it was/is said to them: "Believe with what God descended." They said: "We believe with what is descended on us and they disbelieve with what is behind/beyond it, and it is the truth confirming to what (is) with them." Say: "So why do you kill God's prophets from before, if you were believing?"
And Moses had (E) come to you with the evidences, then you took/received the calf from after him, and you are unjust/oppressive.
And when We took your promise/covenant and We raised the mountain above/over you. Take/receive what We brought (to) you with a strength/power and hear/listen. They said: "We heard and we disobeyed." And they were made to drink/mix/saturate in their hearts/minds the calf with their disbelief. Say: "How bad (is what) your faith/belief orders/commands you with it, if you were believing?"
Say: "If the home (of) the last (other life) was for you, at God clearly/purely (exclusively) from other than the people, so wish/desire the death/lifelessness if you were truthful."
And they will never/not wish/desire it, never, because (of) what their hands advanced , and God (is) knowledgeable with the unjust.
And you will find them (E) the people most holding stingily and desiring strongly on (a) life/existence and from those who shared/made partners with God, any of them wishes/loves if he be granted long life (a) thousand years, and it is not with moving/hurriedly pushing him from the torture, that he be granted long life ,and God (is) seeing/understanding with what they make/do/work.
Say: "Who was an enemy to Gabriel , so that he descended it on your heart/mind with God's permission, confirming to what (is) between his hands, and (a) guidance and a good news to the believers."
Who was an enemy to God, and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel , and Michael , so then God (is) an enemy to the disbelievers.
And We had descended to you evidences signs/verses/evidences, and none disbelieves with it except the debauchers .
Is (it) whenever they promised a promise/contract a group of them broke it , but most of them do notbelieve.
And when a messenger came to them from at God confirming to what (is) with them, a group from those who were given The Book , discarded/rejected God's Book behind their backs, as if they do not know.
And they followed what the devils read/recite on Soliman's kingdom/ownership and Soliman did not disbelieve, and but the devils disbelieved. They teach the people the magic/sorcery and what was descended on the two kings/angels Harut and Marutat Babylon, and they (B) do not teach from anyone until they (B) say: "But we are a test , so do not disbelieve". So they learn from them (B) what they separate with it between the human/man and his wife, and they are not with harming with it from anyone except with God's permission. And they learn what harms them and does not benefit them, and they had known for who (E) bought it, (there is) no share of blessing/fortune for him in the end (other life), and how bad (E) (is) what they bought/volunteered with it themselves, if they were knowing?
And if they had believed and feared and obeyed, then a reward (E) from at God, (is) better if they were knowing.
You, you those who believed, do not say: "Observe us ." And say: "Give us time And hear/listen, and to the disbelievers (is) a painful torture.
Those who disbelieved from the people of The Book and nor the sharing (with God) , they do not wish/love that a goodness be descended on you from your Lord, and God singles out/specializes with His mercy whom He wills/wants, and God (is) of the grace/favour , the great .
We do not erase/nullify/abolish from a sign/verse/evidence , or We make it forgotten, (except that) We come/bring with better than it, or similar/equal/alike to it. Do you not know that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable ?
Do you not know that for God (for) Him (is) the ownership/kingdom (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and (there is) none for you from other than God from (a) guardian and nor (a) victorior.
Or do you want that you question/ask your messenger, as Moses was questioned/asked from before, and who exchanges/replaces/substitutes the disbelief with the belief, so he had misguided the way's/road's straightness/equality .
Many from The Book's people wished/loved if they return you (back) from after your belief (to) disbelievers, envying/jealousy from at themselves from after what was clarified to them (from) the truth , so forgive/pardon and forgive/pardon until God comes with His order/command , that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable .
And keep up the prayers and give the charity/purification and what you advance to yourselves from goodness, you find it at God, that God (is) with what you make/do seeing/understanding .
And they said: "Will never enter the Paradise except who was Jewish or Christian ." Those are their wishes/desires. Say: "Give me your proof/evidence if you were truthful."
Yes/certainly, who submitted/surrendered his faith/direction to God and he is (a) good doer, so for him his reward (is) at his Lord and no fear/fright on them and nor they be saddened/grieving.
And the Jews said: "The Christians are not on a thing." And the Christians said: "The Jews are not on a thing." And they read/recite The Book , like that those who do not know said similar (to) their saying so God judges between them (in) the Resurrection Day, in what they were in it differing/disagreeing .
And who is more unjust/oppressive from (than) who prevented (in) God's mosques that His name be mentioned/remembered in it, and strived/hastened in its destruction/spoilage . Those, it was not for them that they enter it except afraid/frightened. For them in the present world (is) shame/disgrace and for them in the end (other life) (is a) great torture.
And to God the sunrise/east and the sunset/west, so wherever you turn, so there (is) God's face/direction, that God is rich/extended , knowledgeable.
And they said: "God took/received a child (son) His praise/glory, but to Him what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, each/all for him (are) obeying humbly .
Creating marvelously without precedent the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and if He ordered/accomplished a matter/affair , so but he says to it: "Be." So it will become.
And those who do not know said: "If only God converses/speaks (to) us or a sign/verse/evidence comes to us." Like that those from before them said alike/similar/equal (to) their saying. Their hearts/minds resembled (each other), We had clarified/explained the signs/verses/evidences to a nation being sure/certain .
That We sent you with the truth (as) an announcer of good news and a warner/giver of notice, and you are not (to) be asked/questioned about the roaring fire's/Hell's owners/company .
And the Jews and nor the Christians will not/never accept/approve about you until you follow their religion/faith . Say: "That God's guidance, it is the guidance." And if (E) you followed their self attractions for desires after what came to you from the knowledge, (there is) none for you from (other than) God from a guardian and nor (a) victorior .
Those who We brought to them The Book they read/recite it its correct/true reading/recitation, those believe with it and who disbelieves with it so those (are) the losers .
You Israel's sons and daughters, remember My blessing , that I blessed on you, and that I preferred/favoured you over the creations all together/(universes).
And fear a day/time, no self rewards/reimburses (removes) from a self a thing, and no redemption/ransom (is) to be accepted/received from it, and nor mediation benefits it, and nor they be given victory/aid.
And when Abraham's Lord tested (him) with words/expressions, so He completed them, (He) said: "That I am making you to the people a leader/example ." He (Abraham) said: "And from my descendants?" He said: "The unjust/oppressors do not receive/obtain My promise ."
And when We put The House (as) a reward/replacement/compensation to the people, and (a) safety/security, and they took from Abraham's place a prayer place , and We entrusted/recommended to Abraham and Ishmael: "That purify/clean/wash (B) My House for the circlers/walkers around , and the devoting/dedicating , and the bowing , the prostrating ."
And when Abraham said: "My Lord , make this a safe/secure country/place , and provide for its people from the fruits, who believed from them, by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day." He said: "And who disbelieved, so I give him long life/make him enjoy a little , then I force him to the fire's torture, and how bad (is) the end/destination ."
And when Abraham raises the foundations/bases from The House , and Ishmael: "Our Lord accept from us, that you are the hearing/listening the knowledgeable."
Our Lord and make us two Moslems to you, and from our descendants, a nation submitting/surrendering/Moslems to you, and show us our rituals/methods of worship and forgive on us, that you are the forgiver, the most merciful.
Our Lord, and send in them a messenger from them (who) reads/recites on (to) them Your verses/evidences and He teaches/instructs them The Book , and the wisdom , and purifies them , that You are the glorious/mighty the wise/ judicious.
And who shuns/turns away from Abraham's religion/faith except who made himself ignorant/foolish ?And We had chosen/purified him in the present world, and that he is in the end (other life) from (E) the correct/righteous.
When his Lord said to him: "Submit/surrender/be Moslem ." He said: "I submitted/surrendered/became Moslem to the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
And Abraham directed/commanded with it his sons and daughters , and Jacob: "You my sons and daughters, that God chose/purified for you the religion, so do not die (E) except and you are submitters/surrenderers/Moslems ."
Or were you witnesses when the death came to Jacob, when he said to his sons and daughters :"What (do) you worship from after me?" They said: "We worship your God and your fathers/forefathers Abraham's and Ishmael's and Issac's God, one God and we are to Him submitters/surrenderers/Moslems."
That is a nation had past for it what it earned/acquired and for you what you earned/acquired and you are not to (be) asked/questioned about what they were doing/making .
And they said: "Be Jews or Christians, you will be guided." Say: "But Abraham's religion/faith submitter/unifier of God , and he was not from the sharers (with God) ."
Say: "We believed with God and what was descended to us and what was descended to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Issac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren/branches/Jewish tribes , and what was given to Moses, and Jesus , and what was given to the prophets from their Lord, we do not separate/distinguish between anyone from them, and we are to Him submitters/surrenderers/Moslems ."
So if they believed with a similar/equal/alike (to) what you believed with (it), so they had been guided, and if they turned away, so but they are in defiance/disobedience , so God will suffice (protect) you against them , and He (is) the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
God's faith/immersion , and who (is) better than God's faith/immersion , and we are to Him worshipping.
Say: "Do you argue with us in God, and He is our Lord and your Lord, and for us (are) our deeds ,and for you your deeds , and we are for Him faithful/loyal ?"
Or (do) you say that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Issac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren/branches/Jewish tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: "Are you more knowing or God? And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who hid/concealed a testimony at (with) him (self) from God, and God is not ignoring about what you make/do ."

And their prophet said to them: "That his ownership's/kingdom's sign/evidence (is) the box/chest ,(it) comes to you, in it (is) a tranquillity/calm/satisfaction from your Lord, and a remainder from what Moses' family , and Aaron's family left. The angels carry it . That in that (is a) sign/evidence (E) to you if you were believing.
So when Saul/Taloot separated/parted with the soldiers/warriors , he said: "That God (is) testing you with a river/waterway, so who drank from it, so he is not from me, and who did not taste it , so he is from me, except who scooped a scoop, with his hand." So they drank from it, except a few from them, so when he crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: "No power/ability/energy to us today with Goliath and his soldiers/warriors." Those who assume/suppose that they are meeting God said: "How many (times) from a little/small group defeated a group (of) many with God's will?" And God (is) with the patient/enduring.
And when they emerged/appeared to Goliath and his soldiers/warriors, they said: "Our Lord, pour on us patience and make our feet firm , and give us victory/aid on (over) the nation, the disbelieving."
So they defeated them with God's will, and David killed Goliath , and God gave him the ownership/kingdom and the wisdom and He taught/instructed him from what He wills/wants, and (if it) was not for God's pushing the people, some/part of them with some/part (with each other), the earth/Planet Earth would have been corrupted/disordered , and but God (is owner) of grace/favour/blessing over the creations altogether/(universes).
Those are God's signs/verses/evidences, We read/recite it on (to) you with the truth , and that you are from the messengers.
Those are the messengers, We preferred/favoured/blessed some/part of them over some/part, from them who spoke/conversed/talked (with) God, and He rose some/part of them steps/stages/degrees. And We gave Jesus ,Mary's son, the evidences, and We supported him with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit , and if God wanted/willed, those from after them would not (have) fought/killed each other from after the evidences came to them, and but they differed/disagreed/disputed, so from them who believed, and from them who disbelieved, and if God willed/wanted, they would not (have) fought/killed each other, and but God does/makes what Hewants/wills/intends.
You, you those who believed, spend from what We provided for you from before that a day comes, (there is) no selling/trading in it and nor faithful/close friendship , and nor mediation, and the disbelievers, they are the unjust/oppressive.
God, no God except He, the live/alive, the of no beginning and self sufficient , no drowsiness/slumber ,and nor sleep takes Him, for Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth. Who (is) that who mediates at Him, except with His permission ? He knows what (is) between their hands and what (is) behind them, and they do not comprehend/envelope with a thing from His knowledge, except with what He wills/wants. His throne/knowledge extended/contained/enriched the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and (it) does not tire/burden Him their (B)'s protection/observation , and He (is) the high/dignified , the great .
No compulsion/force in the religion, the correct/right had been clarified , from the misguidance/failure , so who disbelieves with the devil/every thing worshipped other than God and believes with God, so he had held fast/clung to with the tie/handle , the tight/affirmed, no breaking/cutting to it, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
God (is) guardian/patron (of) those who believed, He brings them out from the darknesses to the light, and those who disbelieved, their guardian/patron (is) the devil/every thing worshipped other than God they bring them out from the light to the darknesses, those are the fire's owners/company , they are in it immortally/eternally .
Did you not see/understand to who quarreled/argued/disputed (with) Abraham in his Lord, that God gave him the ownership/kingdom , when Abraham said: "My Lord, (is) who revives/makes alive and makes die ." He said: "I revive/make alive and I make die." Abraham said: "So then God comes with the sun from the east , so come with it from the west." So who disbelieved was astonished/confused , and God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive.
Or like who passed on (by a) village/urban city and it is destroyed/empty on its ceilings/structures .He Said: "How God revives/makes alive this, after its death/ lifelessness?" So God made him die one hundred years, then He revived/resurrected him . He said: "How many/much did you stay/wait/remain?" He said: "I stayed/waited/remained a day or some/part (of) a day." He said: "Yes/but, you stayed/waited/remained one hundred years, so look to your food and your drink, (it) did not change/rot , and look to your donkey and to make/put/manipulate you (E) (as) a sign/evidence to the people, and look to the bones, how We raise and assemble it over each other then We dress/clothe (cover it with) flesh/meat." So when (it) was clarified/explained to him, he said: "I know that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable ."
And when Abraham said: "My Lord, show me how you revive/make alive the deads." He said: "Did you not believe?" he said: "Yes/certainly, and but (for) my heart/mind to (be) assured/secure (E)." He (Abraham) said: "So take four from the birds, so take them (F) close to you, then put on every mountain from them (F) a part/portion, then call them (F), they come (F) (to) you fast , and know that God isglorious/mighty/powerful/dignified, wise/judicious." (NOTICE USE OF FEMININE IN THE PRECEDING VERSE)
(The) example/proverb (of) those who spend their properties/wealth in God's way/sake (is) as/like (the) example/proverb of a seed/grain (that) sprouted/grew seven ears/spikes , in every ear/spike (are) one hundred grain(s)/seed(s), and God doubles/multiplies for whom He wills/wants, and God (is) rich/abundant ,knowledgeable.

(A) saying/word (of) kindness and forgiveness (is) better from (than) (a) charity following it mild harm, and God (is) rich, clement .
You, you those who believed, do not waste/cancel your charities with the bragging and the mild harm, as that who spends his property/wealth showing off/pretending (to) the people, and does not believe with God, and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, so his example/proverb (is as the) example (of) a smooth rock , on it (is) dust/earth, so struck it a heavy rain , so it left it hard/smooth , they are not capable on a thing from what they gathered/earned , and God does not guide the nation, the disbelieving.
And (the) example/proverb of those who spend their properties/wealths asking/wishing/ desiring God's acceptances/satisfactions , and steadfastness/affirmation from themselves, (is) as (an) example/proverb (of) a treed garden with an elevated ground/hill, a heavy rain struck it , so it brought/gave its fruits two doubles, so if no strong rain struck it, so light rain/drizzle , and God (is) with what you make/do seeing/knowing .
Does one of you (like that to) be for him a treed garden from palm trees and grapes, the rivers flow from below/beneath it . For him in it (are) from all the fruits, and old age struck him , and for him (are) weak descendants, (then) a twister/tornado in it fire, struck it, so it burnt.

The devil promises you the poverty/grief and orders/commands you with enormous/atrocious deeds , and God promises you forgiveness from Him and grace/favour , and God (is) extended/abundant , knowledgeable.
He gives the wisdom (to) whom He wills/wants, and who is given the wisdom, so he had been given much goodness/wealth, and none mentions/remembers except (those) of the pure minds/hearts .
And what you spent from an expense/expenditure, or you made a duty/vow (on yourselves) from a duty/vow , so then God knows it, and (there are) no victoriors/saviors for the unjust/oppressive.
If you show the charities, so it is blessed/praised, and if you hide it and you bring/give (to) the poor/needy ,so it is better for you, and He covers/substitutes from you, from your sins/crimes, and God (is) with what you make/do informed/experienced.
Their guidance (is) not on you, and but God guides whom he wills/wants, and what you spend from goodness/wealth , so it is for yourselves, and you do not spend, except asking/desiring God's face/direction , and what you spend from goodness/wealth is fulfilled/completed to you, and you are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
For the poor , those who were restricted/surrounded in God's way/sake , they are not able (to go) moving/traveling in the earth/Planet Earth, the ignorant/foolish thinks/supposes them (as) rich from the purity/refrainment (dignity), you know them by their expressions/marks , they do not ask/question the people persistently , and what you spend from goodness/wealth , so that God (is) with it knowledgeable.
Those who spend their properties/wealths at the night and the daytime secretly and openly/publicly ,so for them (is) their reward/fee at their Lord, and no fear on them, and nor they be sad/grieving.
Those who eat the growth/interest/usury , they do not stand/keep up except as (that who) stands/keeps up who the devil strikes/touches him from the madness, that (is) because they (E) said: "But the selling/trading (is) equal/similar/alike (to) the growth/interest/usury , and God permitted/allowed the selling/trading and forbade the growth/interest/usury ." So who came to him (got) a warning/advice from his Lord, so he ended/stopped , so for him what preceded/past , and his matter/affair (is) to God, and who returned , so those are the fire's owners/company , they are in it immortally/eternally .
God nullifies/erases/destroys the growth/interest/usury , and He grows/increases the charities, and God does not love/like every (insisting) disbeliever , sinner/criminal.
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and kept up/performed the prayers, and gave/brought the charity/purification , for them at their Lord (is) their reward/wage , and no fear/fright on them and nor they be sad/grieving.
You, you those who believed, fear and obey God and leave what remained from the growth/interest/usury , if you were believing.
So if you do not make/do, so be announced to/informed with (of) a battle/war from God and His messenger, and if you repented , so for you (are) your properties/wealths/beginnings/(capital) (keep only your capital), you do not cause injustice/oppression (to others) and nor be caused injustice to/oppressed.
And if he was of a hardship/poverty , so a consideration/glance to an easiness/prosperity , and that (E) you give charity (forgive the loan), (it is) best/better for you if you were knowing.

And whom the duty is on him (the borrower), should dictate (E) , and should fear and obey (E) God his lord, and does (should) not reduce/cheat from it a thing, so if whom the duty is on him (the borrower), was ignorant/foolish or weak, or that he is not able that to dictate he, so his guardian should dictate (E) with justice/equality and call a witness, two witnesses/testifiers from your men, so if they (B) are not two men, so a man and two women, from what/whom you accept/approve from the witnesses/testifiers that (E) one of them (B) be misguided, so she reminds the other (F). And the witnesses (should) not refuse/hate if as long as they are called , and do not be bored/tired that to write/dictate it small/little or big/great , to its term/time, that (is) more just/equitable at God, and more just/direct to the testimony/witnessing and nearer that you not be doubtful/suspicious, except that (it) be present commercial buying and selling , you run/manage it between you, so an offense/guilt/sin is not on you that you do not write/dictate it, and call a witness if you sold/traded (to each other).

To God what is in the skies/space and what is in the earth/Planet Earth, and if you show what is in yourselves or you hide it, God counts/calculates (with) you with it, so He forgives to whom He wills/wants and tortures whom He wills/wants, and God (is) on every thing capable/powerful .
The messenger believed with what was descended to him from his Lord and the believers all/each believed with God and His angels, and His Books , and His messengers, we do not separate distinguish/differentiate between any one from His messengers, and they said: "We heard/listened, and we obeyed, your forgiveness, our Lord, and to you (is) the end/destination ."
God does not burden/impose a self except its endurance/capability , for it what it earned/acquired and on it what it earned/acquired . Our Lord do not punish/blame us if we forgot or mistook/wronged . Our Lord and do not burden/load on us a weight/crime , as you burdened/loaded it on those from before us. Our Lord and do not burden/load us what (there is) no power/ability/energy for us with it, and forgive/pardon on us, and forgive for us, and have mercy upon us, you are our guardian , so give us victory on/over the nation, the disbelievers.
A L M .
God, no God except He, the alive , the of no beginning and self sufficient .
He descended on you The Book with the truth , confirming to what (is) between His hands, and He descended the Torah and the New Testament/Bible .
From before guidance to the people, and He descended the Separator of Right and Wrong/Koran , that those who disbelieved with God's verses , for them (is) a strong (severe) torture, and God (is) glorious/mighty , (owner) of a revenge/punishment.
That God, no(thing) hides on Him, in the earth/Planet Earth and nor in the sky/space.
He is who pictures/forms you in the wombs/uteruses how (as) He wants/wills, no God except He, the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious.
He is who descended on you The Book , from it (are) perfected/tightened verses, they are (F) The Book's origin/mother , and others resembling/ambiguous/obscure , so but those who in their hearts/minds (is) deviation from truth , so they follow what resembled from it, asking/desiring the treason and asking/desiring its interpretation/explanation , and none knows its interpretation/explanation except God. And the affirmed in the knowledge , they say: "We believed with it, all/each (is) from at our Lord, and none remember/mention except (those) of the pure minds/intelligence ."
Our Lord, do not deviate from truth our hearts/minds after when You guided us, and grant/present for us from at You a mercy, that you are the grantor/presenter .
Our Lord, that you are gathering/collecting the people to a day/time no doubt in it. That God does not break the appointment.
That those who disbelieved, their properties/wealths and nor their children, will not enrich (help) them from God, a thing, and those are the fire's fuel.
As Pharaoh's family and those from before them's affairs/habits, they lied/denied with Our signs/verses/evidences, so God took/punished them because of their crimes. And God (is) strong (severe in) the torture.
Say to those who disbelieved: "You will be defeated/conquered , and be gathered to Hell , and how/what (is) the bad/low ground .
(It) had been a sign/evidence for you in two groups (who) met , a group fights/kills in God's way/sake , and another disbelieving, they see them (as) two equals to them (B) (twice as much as them) (by) the eye's sight/vision, and God supports with His victory whom He wills/wants, that in that (is) an example/a warning (E) to (those) of the eye sights/ knowledge.
(It) was decorated/beautified to the people the lusts'/desires'/cravings' love/like from the women, and the sons and daughters , and the vaulted tons from the gold and the silver, and the identified/distinguished (from) the horses , and the camels/livestock , and the agricultural land/plants that (is) the present life's/worldly life's enjoyment and God, at Him good/beautiful (is) the return.
Say: "Do I inform you with (a) better than that. To those who feared and obeyed, at their Lord (are) treed gardens/paradises, the rivers flow from below/beneath it, immortally/eternally in it, and purified spouses and acceptance from God, and God (is) seeing/knowing with the worshippers ."
Those who say: "Our Lord, that we truly believed, so forgive for us our crimes and protect us/make us avoid the fire's torture."
The patient and the truthful, and the obeying humbly , and the spending , and the ones asking for forgiveness, at the times at end of night, before dawn .
God witnessed that He, (there is) no God except He, and the angels and those of the knowledge (He is) keeping up/taking care of with the just/equitable, no God except He, the glorious , the wise/judicious . (God and the angels and those of the knowledge witnessed/testified that there is no God except God alone.)
That truly the religion at God, (is) the Islam/submission/surrender, and those who were given The Book did not differ/disagree/dispute, except from after what (that) the knowledge came to them, oppression/corruption between them, and who disbelieves with God's signs/verses , so that God (is) quick/speedy (in) the counting/calculating .
So if they argued/quarreled with you so say: "I submitted/surrendered my face/front to God and who followed me." And say to those who were given The Book and the illiterates/belongers to a nation : "Did you submit/surrender?" So if they submitted/surrendered/became Moslem, so they had been guided, and if they turned, so but on you (is) the information/communication, and God (is) with the worshippers seeing/knowing .
That those who disbelieve with God's signs/verses , and kill the prophets, without right , and they kill those who order/command with the just/equitable from the people, so announce good news to them with a painful torture.
Those are whose deeds (were) wasted in the present world , and the end/other life, and (there is) none for them from (a) savior/victoriors .
Did you not see/understand to those who were given a share/fortune from The Book , they are being called to God's Book to judge/rule between them, then a group from them turns away, and they are objecting/opposing.
That (is) because they said: "The fire will not/never touch us, except a counted/numbered days/times, and deceived/tempted them in their religion what they were fabricating . 
So how (is it) if We gathered/collected them to a day/time (there is) no doubt/suspicion in it, and every self was fulfilled what it earned/acquired , and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
Say: "Oh/You God , owner/possessor (of) the ownership/kingdom , You give/bring the ownership/kingdom (to) whom You will/want, and You remove/pull away the ownership/kingdom from whom You will/want, and You empower/dignify whom You will/want, and humiliate/disgrace whom You will/want, with Your hand (is) the good/wealth , that You are on every thing capable/powerful ."
You make the night enter/penetrate in the daytime, and You make the daytime enter/penetrate in the night , and You bring out the alive from the dead/lifeless, and You bring out the dead from the alive , and You provide for whom You want/will without counting/calculating .
The believers do not take the disbelievers (as) guardians/friends from other than the believers, and who does that, so he is not from God in a thing, except that you fear from them fear/fright , and God cautions/warns you (of) Himself, and to God (is) the end/destination .
Say: "If you hide what is in your chests (innermosts) or you show it, God knows it, and He knows what (is) in the skies/space, and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and God (is) on every thing capable/able ."
A day/time every self finds what it made/did from good (is) present/brought, and what it made/did from a bad/evil/harm, (it) wishes/loves that if between it (the self), and between it (the bad/evil/harm) a distant/far time/duration and God warns/cautions you (of) Himself and God (is) merciful/compassionate with the worshippers .
Say: "If you were/are loving/liking God, so follow me, God (then) loves/likes you, and forgives for you your crimes, and God (is) forgiving, most merciful ."
Say: "Obey God, and the messenger." So if they turned away , so then God does not love/like the disbelievers.
That God chose/purified Adam and Noah and Abraham's family, and Amran's family on the creations altogether/(universes).
Descendants some of it from some, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
When Amran's woman (wife) said: "My Lord, that I made a duty/vow (on myself that) to You what is in my belly , freed/liberated , so accept from me, that You, You (are) the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable."
So when she gave birth to her, she said: "My Lord, that I gave birth to her, a female." And God (is) more knowing with what she gave birth to. "And the male is not as/like the female and that I named her Mary ,and that I seek protection for her with (in) You, and her descendants, from the devil the cursed/expelled."
So her Lord accepted her, with a good acceptance , and He grew her good growth, and Zachary sponsored/maintained her, whenever Zachary entered on her (in) the center of the home/prayer direction/the prayer's niche , he found at her a provision, he said: "You Mary, from where (is) that to you?" She said: "It is from at God, that God provides for whom He wills/wants without counting/calculating."
At that place and time Zachary called his Lord, he said: "My Lord grant/present for me, from at you good descendants, that you are hearing/listening (to) the call/request/prayer."
So the angels called him, and he is standing/keeping praying, in the prayer's niche : "That God announces good new to you with John confirming with a word from God and a master and restricting himself (chaste) , and a prophet from the correct/righteous people."
He said: "My Lord, how/from where (can it) be for me a boy , the old age reached me , and my woman (wife is) infertile?" He said: "As/like that God makes/does what He wills/wants."
He said: "My Lord, make for me a sign/evidence." He said: "Your sign/evidence (is) that you not converse/speak (to) the people (for) three days, except (by) signaling/pointing. And mention/remember your Lord much, and praise/glorify with the evening and the daybreaks/early mornings ."
And when the angels said: "You, Mary, that God chose/purified you , and purified you , and chose/purified you over the creations all together/(universes') women."
You Mary, obey humbly to your Lord, and prostrate, and bow with the bowing .
That (is) from the unseen's/absent's information/news, We inspired/transmitted it to you, and you were not at/by them when they throw their pens/small arrows used for gambling draws, (to see) which of them sponsors/supports Mary, and you were not at/by them when they argue/controvert (amongst themselves).
When the angels said: "You Mary, that God announces good news to you, with a word/expression from Him, his name (is) the Messiah Jesus Mary's son, noble in the present world/near and the end (other life), and from the neared/closer."
And he converses/speaks (to) the people in the crib/cradle and aged approximately between  -  years ,and (he is) from the correct/righteous.
She said: "My Lord, how is (it) for me (a) child and not (a) human touched me?" He said: "Like that/that is it, God creates what He wills/wants if He ordered a matter, so but He says to it: 'Be.' So it is/will be."
And He teaches/instructs him The Book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Bible/Holy book descended on Jesus .
And a messenger to Israel's sons and daughters (said): "That I had come to you (with) a sign/evidence from your Lord, that I create for you from the mud/clay as a shape/form (of) the birds, so I blow in it, so it will be flying/birds with God's permission, and I cure and heal the blind/the born blind, and the leper and I revive/make alive the deads with God's permission, and I inform you with what you eat and what you hoard/stock in your houses/homes. That in that (is) a sign/evidence (E) for you if you were believers/believing."
And confirming to what (is) between my hands from the Torah and to permit/allow for you some (of) what was forbidden on you, and I came to you with a sign/evidence from your Lord, so fear and obey God and obey me. 
That God (is) my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him, this (is a) straight/direct road/way.
So when Jesus felt (with one of his five physical senses) from them the disbelief, he said: "Who (are) my victoriors/saviors/supporters to God?" The Disciples/victoriors said: "We (are) God's victoriors/supporters, we believed with God, and (you) be a witness with that we are submitters/surrenderers."
Our Lord, we believed with what You descended, and we followed the messenger, so write (include) us with the witnessing/testifying.
And they cheated/deceived and God cheated/deceived, and God (is) the best (of) the cheaters/deceivers.
When God said: "You Jesus I am, I am making you die and raising you to Me and purifying you from those who disbelieved, and making those who followed you above those who disbelieved to the Resurrection Day, then to Me (is) your return, so I judge/rule between you in what, you were in it differing .
So but those who disbelieved, so I torture them, a strong (severe) torture in the present world/near and the end (other life), and (there are) nothing for them from victoriors/saviors.
And but those who believed and did the correct/righteous deeds, so He fulfills/completes (to) them their rewards , and God does not love/like the unjust/oppressive.
That We read/recited it on you from the signs/verses/evidences and the reminder, the wise/judicious .
That Jesus' example at God (is) as Adam's example, (He) created him from dust/earth then He said to him: "Be." So he became.
The truth (is) from your Lord, so do not be from the doubting/arguing.
So who argued/quarreled with you in it from after what came to you from the knowledge, so say: "Come, we (will) call our sons, and your sons, and our women, and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, then we curse each other/pray humbly , so we make God's curse/torture on the liars ."
That this (is) it (E), the narratives/information (true stories) the truth, and (there is) none from a god except God, and that God, he (E) (is) the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious.
So if they turned away, so that God (is) knowledgeable with the corrupting .
Say: "You people (of) The Book, come to a word equal/straight, between us and you, that we do not worship except God, and we do not share/make partners with Him a thing, and (we) do not take some of us, some (as) lords from other than God." So if they turned away, so say: "Witness/testify with that (we are) submitters/surrenderers/Moslems."
You The Book's people, why (do) you argue/quarrel in Abraham, and the Torah and the New Testament/Bible were not descended except from after him, so do you not reason/understand?
Here you are, those (who) argued/quarreled in what for you knowledge with it (you are knowledgeable in), so why do you argue/quarrel in what is not for you with it knowledge (you are not knowledgeable in)? And God knows and you do not know.
Abraham was not a Jew and nor a Christian and but (he) was (a) true submitter/Moslem/Unifier of God a Moslem/submitter, and (he) was not from the sharers/takers of partners (with God). 
That the people most worthy with Abraham are those who followed him and this the prophet and those who believed, and God (is) the believer's guardian/patron .
A group from The Book's people, wished/loved if they misguide you, and they do not misguide except themselves and they do not feel/know/sense.
You The Book's people, why do you disbelieve with God's signs/verses/evidences, and you are witnessing/testifying?
You The Book's people, why do you confuse/mix/cover/dress the correct/truth with the falsehood and you hide/conceal the correct/truth and you are knowing?
And a group from The Book's people, said: "Believe with (what) was/is descended on those who believed (during the) face/front (beginning of) the daytime and disbelieve (during) its end, maybe they return."
And do not believe except to whom followed your religion, say: "That the guidance (is) God's guidance." That one be given equal/alike (to) what you were given or they argue/quarrel with you at your Lord. Say: "That the grace/favour (is) with God's hand, He gives it (to) whom He wills/wants, and God (is) spacious ,knowledgeable."
He singles out/specializes with His mercy whom He wills/wants, and God (is owner) of the great grace/favour.
And from The Book's people, whom if you entrust him with a (ton) , he discharges/fulfills (pays) it (back) to you, and from them whom, if you entrust him with a dinar , (he) does not discharge/fulfill (pay) it (back) to you, except as long as you continued keeping up (demanding) on him. That is with that they said: "It is not on us in the illiterates/belongers to a nation (a) means (we do not have to be honest when dealing with other nations)." And they say on God the lie/falsehood and they know.
Yes/certainly, who fulfilled with his promise and feared and obeyed, so that God loves/likes the fearing and obeying.
That those (who) buy/volunteer with God's promise/contract and their oaths a small price, those/these (have) no share of blessing/fortune for them in the end (other life), and God does not speak/talk to them, and nor look to them (on) the Resurrection Day and nor purifies/corrects them, and for them (is a) painful torture.
And that from them (is) a group (E) (who) twist/turn/distort (misconstruct with) their tongues with The Book, so that you think/suppose it (is) from The Book, and it is not from The Book, and they say: "It (is) from at God". And it is not from at God, and they say on God the lie/falsehood and they are knowing.
It was not to a human that God gives him The Book and the judgment/rule and the prophethood then he says to the people: "Be/become worshippers/slaves to me, from other than God". And but: "Be knowledgeable Lord worshippers with what you were teaching The Book and with what you were studying ".
And (he) does not order you that to take the angels and the prophets (as) Lords (Gods). Does he order/command you with the disbelief, after when you are submitters/surrenderers/Moslems? 
And when/if God took the prophets' promise/covenant what/that what (E) I gave/brought you from a Book and wisdom , then a messenger came to you confirming to/for what (is) with you, to believe with him/it (E) and you will give him/it victory/aid (E). He said: "Did you confess/acknowledge and you took/received on that My promise ?" They said: "We confessed/acknowledged ." He said: "So witness/testify and I am with you from the witnessing/testifying/present."
So who turned away after that, so those are the debauchers .
Is (it) other than God's religion they desire, and to Him submitted/surrendered whom (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth voluntarily and compellingly/forcefully, and to Him you are being returned?
Say: "We believed with God, and what descended on us, and what descended on Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren , and what Moses and Jesus and the prophets were given/brought from their Lord, we do not separate/distinguish/differentiate between any from them, and we are for Him submitters/surrenderers/Moslems."
And who desires/wishes other than the Islam/submission/surrender (as) a religion, so (it) will never/not be accepted from him, and he (is) in the end from the losers.
How God guides a nation (who) disbelieved after their belief, and they witnessed/testified that the messenger (is) correct/true/real/right and the evidences came to them? And God does not guide the nation, the unjust/oppressive.
Those, their reward (is) that on them (is) God's curse/torture and the angel's, and the people all (E).
Immortally/eternally in it, the torture is not reduced/lightened on/from them, and nor they be given time/delayed .
Except those who repented, from after that, and corrected/repaired , so then God (is) forgiving, merciful.
That those who disbelieved after their faith/belief, then they increased disbelief, their repentance will never/not (be) accepted, and those are the misguided.
That those who disbelieved, and died and they are disbelievers, so will never/not be accepted from anyone of them the Earth's fill (of) gold and (even) if he ransomed/compensated with it. Those, for them (is) a painful torture, and (there are) none for them from victoriors/saviors.
You will never/not obtain the righteousness/charitability until you spend from what you love/like, and what you spend from a thing, so then God (is) with it knowledgeable.
All the food was/is/became permitted/allowed to Israel's sons and daughters, except what Israel forbade on himself from before that the Torah (was) made to descend. Say: "So come/bring with the Torah, so read/recite it if you were truthful."
So who fabricated on God the lie/falsehood from after that, so those are the unjust.
Say: "God is truthful, so follow Abraham's faith/religion , a submitter/Moslem , and he was not from the takers (of) partners (with God) ."
That (the) first House/Home was raised to the people, (is) which (E) (is) with (in) Bekka , blessed and guidance, to the creations altogether/(universes). 
In it (are) signs/verses/evidences evidences (in) Abraham's place/position , and who entered it, was/is/became safe/secure, and to God on the people performing pilgrimage (to) the House/Home who was/is able (to find) a way/method to it, and who disbelieved, so that God (is) rich from (not in need to) the creations altogether/(universes).
Say: "You The Book's people, why do you disbelieve with God's signs/verses/evidences, and God (is an) honest witness on what you make/do/work?"
Say: "You The Book's people , why do you prevent/obstruct from God's way/path who believed, you desire it (be) bent/crookedness, and you are witnessing/testifying, and God is not with ignoring/neglecting what you are making/doing/working."
You (those) who believed, if you obey a group from those who were given The Book , they return you after your believing (to) disbelieving.
And how do you disbelieve and on you are (being) read/recited God's verses/evidences and in (among) you (is) His messenger, and who holds fast/takes protection with God, so he had been guided to a straight/direct road/way.
You, you those who believed fear and obey God, His real/deserved fear and obedience, and do not die (E) except and you are submitters/surrenderers/Moslems.
And hold fast/take protection with God's rope/covenant , all together, and do not separate, and mention/remember God's blessing on you when you were enemies, so He united between your hearts , so you became with His blessings brothers, and you were on (the) edge/brink (of) a pit/hole from the fire, so He rescued/saved you from it, like that God clarifies for you His signs/verses/evidences, maybe/perhaps you be guided.
And to be (E) (should be) from you a nation , (who) call to the good , and they order/command with the kindness/known , and they forbid/prevent from the awfulness/obscenity , and those, they are the successful/winners .
And do not be like those who separated and differed , from after what the evidences came to them, and those, for them (is a) great torture.
A day (when) faces whiten and faces blacken, so but whose faces blackened, (will be told): "Did you disbelieve after your faith/belief? So taste/experience the torture because (of) what you were disbelieving."
And but those whose faces whitened, so in God's mercy, they are in it immortally/eternally .
Those are God's signs/verses/evidences, We read/recite it on you with the truth , and God does not want injustice/oppression to the creations altogether/(universes).
And for God, what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and to God return the matters/affairs.
You were (the) best nation , brought out to the people, you order/command with the kindness/known , and you forbid/prevent from the awfulness/obscenity , and you believe with God, and if The Book's people believed, (it) would have been/would be best for them, from them (are) the believing/believers, and most of them (are) the debauchers .
They never harm you , except mild harm, and if they fight you, they turn away (from) you, (giving you) the backs/ends, then they do not be given victory.
The humiliation/disgrace (is) forced on them, wherever they were defeated/overtaken , except with a covenant/agreement from God, and a covenant/agreement from the people, and they returned/resided with anger from God, and the poverty/oppression (was) forced on them, that (is) with what they were disbelieving with God's signs/verses/evidences, and they kill the prophets without right, that (is) because (of) what they disobeyed, and they were transgressing .
They are not equal/alike , from The Book's people, (are) a nation standing/keeping up , they read/recite God's signs/verses/evidences (during) the night's hours, and they prostrate.
They believe with God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and they order/command with the kindness/known , and they forbid/prevent from the awfulness/obscenity , and they rush in the goodness (good deeds), and those are from the correct/righteous.
And what they make/do from a good, they will never/not (be) denied (loose) it, and God (is) knowledgeable with the fearing/obeying.
That those who disbelieved, their properties/possessions/wealths and nor their children enrich (them) from God a thing, and those are the fire's company , they are in it immortally/eternally.
(An) example of what they spend in this the life the present/worldly life (is) as (the) example (of) a wind, in it (is) severe cold/frost, it struck a nation's cultivation/plantation, they caused injustice (to) themselves, so it destroyed/wasted it , and God did not cause injustice to them, and but (it is) themselves they cause injustice to.
You, you those who believed, do not take a confidant from other than you, they do not slacken/relax in (causing) degeneration/corruption (to) you, they loved/wished what you suffered (from) exertion/burden . The intense, hatred/animosity appeared from their mouths, and what their chests (innermosts) hide (is) greater/bigger. We have clarified to you the signs/verses/evidences if you were/are understanding .
Here you are, those (who) love/like them, and they do not love/like you, and you believe with The Book, all of it, and (when) they met you, they said: "We believed." And if they were alone/together they bit on you the fingertips from the anger/rage . Say: "Die with your anger/rage, that God (is) knowledgeable with (what is) in the chests (innermosts)."
If a good/goodness touches you, it harms them, and if a sin/crime strikes you, they become happy/rejoiced with it, and if you be patient and you fear and obey, their plotting/conspiring does not harm you a thing. That God (is) with what they make/do/work surrounding .
And when you went early from your family/people, you assign the believers sitting places (positions) to the fighting/killing, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
When two groups from you started/began that they weaken and become cowardly (B) , and God (is) their (B)'s guardian and on God so should rely/depend the believers.
And God had (E) given you victory/aid with (at) Badr , and you are humiliated/disgraced , so fear and obey God, maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
If/when you say to the believers: "Is it not enough/sufficient for you that your Lord extends (supplies) you with three thousand from the angels sent descending?"
Yes/certainly if you be patient and you fear and obey, and they come to you from this their promptness (at once) , your Lord extends (supplies) you with five thousand from the angels marked/identified .
And God did not make/manipulate it except (as) a good news to you and to assure/tranquillise your hearts with it, and the victory/aid is not except from at God, the glorious/mighty , the wise judicious.
To cut off/separate an end/edge from those who disbelieved, or He humiliates/destroys/returns them with rage, so they turn/return failures .
(It) is not to you from the matter/affair a thing, or He forgives on them or He tortures them, so then they are unjust/oppressors.
And to God what is in the skies/space and what is in the earth/Planet Earth, He forgives, for whom He wills/wants and He tortures whom He wills/wants, and God (is) forgiving , merciful .
You, you those who believed, do not eat, the growth/increase/interest doubles doubled , and fear and obey God, maybe/perhaps you succeed/win.
And fear (and avoid) the fire which was/is prepared to the disbelievers.
And obey God and the messenger, maybe/perhaps you attain mercy.
And quicken/speed to a forgiveness from your Lord and a treed garden/paradise, its width (is) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, (it) was/is prepared to the fearing and obeying.
Those who spend in the prosperity, and (in) the calamity, and the suppressing the anger/rage , and the forgiving/pardoning on the people, and God loves/likes the good doers .
And those who if they made/did an enormous/atrocious deed , they caused injustice (to) themselves, they mentioned/remembered God, so they asked for forgiveness for their crimes, and who forgives the crimes except God? And they did not insist/persist on what they made/did, and they know .
Those, their reward (is) forgiveness from their Lord, and treed gardens, the rivers flow from underneath it, immortally in it, and blessed/praised (is) the makers'/doers' reward.
Laws/ways had past/left from before you, so move/walk in the earth/Planet Earth, so look/consider how was the liars'/denier's end (result) .
This (is) evidence/logic to the people and guidance, and a sermon/advice/warning to the fearing and obeying.
And do not weaken/enfeeble , and do not be saddened/grieved, and you are the overcoming and becoming dignified/defeating, if you were believing. 
If a wound/ulcer (pain) touches you, so a wound/ulcer (pain) equal/alike to it had touched the nation, and those are the days/times, We rotate/alternate it between the people, and (for) God to know those who believed, and (to) take from you witnesses (martyrs), and God does not love/like the unjust/oppressors.
And (for) God to purify/clarify/cleanse those who believed, and to annihilate/wipe off the disbelievers.
Or (have) you thought/supposed that you enter the Paradise, and God did not (E) know, those who struggled/did utmost from you, and He knows the patient.
And you had been wishing/desiring the death, from before that you meet/find it, so you had seen it and you (are) looking .
And Mohammad is not except a messenger, had passed/expired from before him the messengers, so if he died, or (he was) killed, you turned/returned on your heels , and whom turns/returns, on his two heels, so he will never/not harm God, a thing, and God will reward the thankful/grateful.
And it was not to a self that to die except with God's permission, a decree/destiny/fate delayed , and who wants/wills the present world's reward, We give him from it, and who wants/wills the end's (other life's) reward, We give him from it, and We will reward the thankful/grateful.
And how many from a prophet fought/killed with him many knowledgeable Lord worshippers? So they did not weaken/enfeeble for (what) struck them in God's sake , and they did not weaken, and they did not become humiliated/disgraced, and God loves/likes the patient.
And their saying was not, except that they said: "Our Lord, forgive for us our crimes and our spoilage/wastefulness in our matter/affair, and affix/make our feet firm, and give us victory/aid over the nation, the disbelieving."
So God gave them the present world's reward, and the end's (other life's) beautiful/good reward, and God loves/likes the good doers.
You, you those who believed, if you obey those who disbelieved, they return you on your heels, so you turn/return losers .
No/but , God (is) your master/ally , and He is best (of) the victoriors/saviors/supporters.
We will throw in those who disbelieved's hearts the terror because (of) what they shared with God what (He) did not descend with it a proof/evidence/authority, and their shelter/refuge (is) the fire , and how bad (is) the unjust's home/residence/dwelling .
And God had been (E) truthful to you (in) His promise to you when you killed/uprooted them with His permission, until you weakened and became cowardly/failed and you disputed in the matter/affair, and you disobeyed from after what He showed you what you love/like, from you who want the present world and from you who want the end (other life), then He diverted you from them, to test you and He had (E) forgiven on you, and God (is owner) of grace on the believers.
When you ascend/have hardship and do not wait/stop on anyone, and the messenger calls you in your end/back , so you were flooded/rewarded grief/depression with a grief/depression, so that you not be saddened on what passed/missed you permanently, and nor what struck you, and God (is) expert/experienced with what you make/do.
Then (He) descended on you from after the grief/depression safety/security, slumbering/dozing (to) cover/make unconscious a group from you, and a group, their selves had interested/concerned them, they suspect with God other than the truth , the pre-Islamic Paganism's/ignorance's suspicion . They say: "Is there for us from a thing from the matter/affair?" Say: "That the matter/affair, all of it (is) to God." They hide in themselves what they do not show to you. They say: "If (there) was for us from the matter/affair a thing, we would not (have) killed/fought here here." Say: "If you were in your houses/homes, those who (it) was written/decreed on them the fighting would have emerged/appeared to their places of lying down (beds), and (for) God to test what is in their hearts (innermosts), and to purify/clarify/cleanse what is in your hearts/minds and God (is) knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts).
That those who turned away from you, a day/time the two groups/gatherings met, but the devil made them slip/fall/sin , with some/part (of) what they earned/gathered , and God had forgiven/pardoned on them, that God (is) forgiving, clement.
You, you those who believed, do not be like those who disbelieved and said to their brothers if they moved in the earth/Planet Earth or they were invading/raiding: "If they were at us, they would not (have) died, and they would not (have) been killed." (For) God to make/put that grief/sorrow/eagerness in their hearts/minds , and God revives/makes alive and makes die, and God (is) with what you make/do/work seeing/knowing.
And if (E) you were killed in God's way/sake or you died, a forgiveness (E) from God, and a mercy (is) better from what they gather/collect/accumulate.
And if you died or you were killed, to (E) God you are being gathered.
So with what mercy from God you became lenient/softened to them, and if you were rough/rude/crude, hard/strong the heart/mind, they would have scattered/separated from around you, so forgive/pardon on them, and ask for forgiveness for them, and discuss/consult with them in the matter/affair, so if you decided/determined, so rely/depend on God, that God loves/likes the reliant/dependent .
If God gives you victory/aid, so (there is) no defeater for you, and if He abandons/deserts you, so who (is) of that to give you victory/aid from after Him? And on God so should rely/depend the believers.
And (it) was not to a prophet to cheat/defraud , and who cheats/defrauds comes with what he cheated/defrauded (in) the Resurrection Day, then each self is fulfilled what it gathered/acquired ,and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
Is that who followed God's acceptance/approval/satisfaction, as who returned with hatred/anger/dissatisfaction from God, and his shelter/refuge (is) Hell , and how bad (is) the end/destination?
They are degrees/stages at God, and God (is) seeing/knowing with what they make/do/work. 
God had blessed on the believers, when He sent in them a messenger from themselves, he reads/recites on them His verses/evidences and he purifies/corrects them, and he teaches/instructs them The Book ,and the wisdom , and if they were from before in (E) a clear/evident misguidance.
Or when a disaster struck/hit you , you had struck/hit equal to it twice , you said: "From where (is) that (the disaster)?" Say: "It is from at yourselves, that God (is) on every thing capable/able ."
And what struck/hit you (on the) day the two groups/gatherings met , so (it is) with God's permission, and to know the believers.
And to know those who exercised hypocrisy, and was said to them: "Come, fight in God's sake or pay/push/repel." They said: "If we know a fight we would have followed you." They are to the disbelief that day nearer/closer, from them to the belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts/minds ,and God (is) more knowing with what they hide/conceal .
Those who said to their brothers and they sat/remained behind : "If they obeyed us, they would not (have) been killed." Say: "So push/drive away (prevent) from yourselves the death if you were truthful."
And do not think/suppose those who (were) killed in God's sake (are) deads, but (they are) alive at their Lord, being provided for.
And happy/rejoiced with what God gave them from His grace/favour , and they (will) be announced good news to/be cheerful with those who did not catch-up/join/reach with them from behind them, is (it) not (that) fear on them (no fear for them), and nor they be sad/grieving?
They be announced good new to with a blessing/goodness from God, and grace/favour, and that God does not waste the believers' reward .
Those who answered/replied to God and the messenger from after what the wound/ulcer (harm) struck them, for those who did good from them, and feared and obeyed, a great reward.
Those who the people said to them: "That the people had gathered for you, so fear them ." So (it) increased them faith/belief and they said: "Enough for us God, and blessed/praised (is) the fulfiller/guardian."
So they turned/returned with a blessing/goodness from God and a grace/favour, (and) bad/evil did not touch them, and they followed God's acceptance/approval , and God (is owner) of great grace/favour.
But that (is) the devil , he frightens his patrons/supporters , so do not fear them, and fear Me, if you were believers.
And do not be saddened/grievous (by) those who quicken/speed in the disbelief, that they will never/not harm God a thing, God wants that (He) not make/create for them luck/fortune (a share) in the end (other life), and for them (is) a great torture.
That those who bought the disbelief with the faith/belief, they will never/not harm God a thing, and for them (is) a painful torture. 
And (let not) those who disbelieved think/suppose (E) that We extend in time/life/enjoyment/delay goodness for themselves, but We extend in time/life/enjoyment/delay for them to increase (them in) sin/crime, and for them (is) a despised torture.
God was not to leave the believers on what you are on it until He distinguishes/separates the bad/malicious from the good , and God was not to show/inform you on the unseen , and but God chooses/purifies from His messengers, whom He wants/wills, so believe with God and His messengers, and if you believe and fear and obey, so for you (is) a great reward.
And let not those who are stingy/miserly with what God gave them from His grace/blessing think/suppose it is good/better for them, but it is bad/evil for them, they will be encircled/surrounded (with) what they were stingy/miser with it (on) the Resurrection Day, and to God (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's inheritance , and God (is) with what you make/do, expert/experienced.
God had heard (the) saying (of) those who said: "That God (is) poor, and we (are) rich." We will write what they said, and their killing (of) the prophets without right , and We say: "Taste/experience the burning's torture."
That (is) because (of) what your hands advanced/presented and that God is not with an unjust/oppressor to the worshippers .
Those who said: "That God promised/recommended to us that We not believe to a messenger until he comes/brings to us with an approachment to God (offering that) the fire eats it." Say: "Messengers had come to you from before me with the evidences , and with what you said, so why (have) you killed them, if you were truthful?"
So if they denied you , so messengers from before you had been denied (rejected), they came with the evidences, and The Books, and The Book , the luminous.
Every self (is) tasting/experiencing the death, and but you are being fulfilled/completed your rewards (on) the Resurrection Day, so who was removed from the fire, and made to enter the Paradise, so he had won/succeeded/triumphed, and the present world/worldly life is not except the deceit's/temptation's enjoyment.
You shall be tested (E) in your properties and yourselves, and you will hear (E) from those who were given The Book from before you, and from those who shared/made partners (with God) much mild harm, and if you be patient, and you fear and obey, so then that (is) from the matters'/affairs' decisiveness/determination.
And when God took/received those who were given The Book's promise/covenant, to clarify/show/explain it (E) to the people, and do not hide/conceal it, so they discarded/rejected it behind/beyond their backs and bought/volunteered with it a small price, so how bad (is) what they buy/volunteer?
Do not think/suppose those who become happy/rejoiced with what they got/were given, and they love/like that they be thanked/praised with what they did not make/do, so do not think/suppose them with a winning/success/triumph from the torture, and for them (is) a painful torture. 
And to God (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/kingdom , and God (is) on every thing capable/able .
That in the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's creation, and the night's and the daytime's (are) difference, signs/evidences (E) to (those) of the pure minds/hearts .
Those who mention/remember God standing , and sitting, and on their sides, and they think in the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's creation, "Our Lord, you have not created that wastefully ,your praise/glory, so protect us (from)/make us avoid the fire's torture."
Our Lord, that you whom you make to enter the fire, so you had shamed/scandalized/disgraced him, and (there are) none to the unjust/oppressors from victoriors/saviors/supporters.
Our Lord, that we heard a caller, calls to the belief, 'That believe with your Lord', so we believed, Our Lord, so forgive for us our crimes, and cover/substitute from us our sins/crimes, and make us die with the righteous.
Our Lord, and give us what you promised us on your messengers, and do not shame/scandalize/disgrace us (on) the Resurrection Day, that you do not break the appointment (promise).
So their Lord answered/replied to them: "That I do not loose/waste the maker's/doer's deed from you, from a male or a female, some/part of you (are) from some/part (you are from each other), so those who emigrated, and were brought out from their homes/houses , and were harmed mildly in My way/sake , and they fought , and they were killed, I cover/substitute (E) from them their sins/crimes, and I will enter them (E) treed gardens, the rivers flow from below/beneath it, a reward from at God, and God at Him (is) the good/beautiful the reward".
(Let) not those who disbelieved's turning (traveling) in the countries deceive you.
(A) little enjoyment, then their shelter/refuge (is) Hell , and how bad (are) the beds ?
However/but those who feared and obeyed their Lord, for them (are) treed gardens, the rivers flow from below/beneath it, immortally/eternally in it a prepared guest house/place of descent from at God, and what (is) at God (is) better to the righteous .
And that from The Book's People whom (E) believes with God and what was descended to you, and what was descended to them, humble and fearing to God, they do not buy with God's signs/verses/evidences a small price, those for them (is) their reward at their Lord, that God (is) quick (in) the counting/calculating .
You, you those who believed, be patient, and compete in patience, and stand firmly on guard/steadfast, and fear and obey God, maybe/perhaps you succeed/win. 
You, you the people, fear and obey your Lord who created you from one self and He created from it its spouse, and He scattered/distributed from them (B) many men and women, and fear and obey God who you ask each other/make oath to each other with Him, and the wombs/uteruses, that God was/is on you observing .
And give the orphans their properties , and do not exchange/replace/substitute the bad/spoiled with the good/beautiful , and do not eat their properties to your properties , that it was a great/large sin/crime .
And if you feared that you not be just/equitable in the orphans , so marry what (was) allowed/permitted for you from the women two twos/twos, and threes, and fours, so if you feared that you not be just/equitable, so (marry) one or what your rights owned/possessed, that (is) nearer that you not side away from justice .
And give the women their dowries specified personally , so if they (them)self allowed/permitted for you from a thing/something from it, so eat it pleasurable/wholesome tasty.

Did you not see to those who were given a share from The Book , they buy/volunteer the misguidance and they want that you (also) be misguided (from) the way?
And God (is) more knowing with (about) your enemies, and enough/sufficient with God (as) a guardian and enough/sufficient with God (as) a victorior/savior .
From those who repented/guided/Jews, they alter the words/expressions from its places, and they say: "We heard/listened and we disobeyed." And hear/listen not making others hear, and: "Observe us ."Distortion with their tongues/languages and defaming in the religion, and if that they said: "We heard/listened and we obeyed and hear/listen and give us time/delay us ." (It) would have been best for them and more just/direct, and but God cursed them, with their disbelief, so they do not believe, except (for a) few. (NOTE: IN HEBREW MEANS `OUR EVIL ONE'),
You, you those who were given The Book , believe with what We descended, confirming to what (is) with you (P) from before that We efface/wipe out faces, so We return it on its backs or We curse/humiliate them as We cursed/humiliated the owners of the Saturday/Sabbath, and God's order/command is/was done.
That God does not forgive that to be shared with Him, and He forgives what (is) other than that, to who He wills/wants, and who shares with God, so he fabricated a great sin/crime.
Did you not see to those who purify themselves, but God purifies/corrects who He wills/wants, and they are not being caused injustice to, (as little as) a cleft in a seed/twine.
See how they are fabricating on God the lies/falsehood, and enough with it, (as an) evident sin/crime
Did you not see to those who were given a share from The Book , they believe with the idol/sorcery/sorcerer and the anything worshipped other than God/the devil , and they say to those who disbelieved: "Those (are) more guided from those who believed (by) a way/path."
Those, are those who God cursed/humiliated them, and whom God humiliates, so you will never find for him a victoriors/savior.
Or for them (is) a share from the ownership/kingdom , so then they do not give the people (as little as) a peck in a seed/stone. 
Or do they envy the people with jealousy on what God gave them, from His grace/favour/blessing, so We had given Abraham's family The Book , and the wisdom, and We gave them a great ownership/kingdom.
So from them who believed with (in) Him, and from them who prevented/obstructed from Him, and enough with Hell blazing.
That those who disbelieved, with Our verses , We will roast them (in) a fire, whenever their skins were done/cooked (burnt), We replaced/substituted them (with) skins other than it, to taste/experience the torture, that God was/is glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.
And those who believed and did/made the correct/righteous deeds, We will enter them treed gardens, the rivers flow from beneath it, (they are) immortally/eternally in it, for them in it (are) purified spouses, and We enter them (in) shade, continuous/permanent shade.
That God, orders/commands you that you discharge/fulfill the deposits/securities to its people (owners), and if you judged/ruled between the people, that you judge/rule with the justice/equality, that God (is) blessed/praised, He preaches/advises/warns you with (about) Him, that God was/is hearing/listening, seeing/knowing/understanding.
You, you those who believed, obey God and obey the messenger, and (those) of the order/command from you, so if you disputed in a thing, so return it to God and the messenger, if you were believing with God, and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, that is better and (the) best interpretation/explanation .
Did you not see to those who claim that they believed with what was descended to you (S/M), and what was descended from before you, they want that to be judged to the anything worshipped other than God/the devil , and they were ordered/commanded that to disbelieve with it, and the devil wants that to misguide them, (a) far/distant misguidance.
And if (it) was said to them: "Come to what God descended and to the messenger." You saw the hypocrites preventing/obstructing from you preventfully/obstructively .
So how if a disaster struck them with what their hands advanced/presented/undertook , then they came to you swearing by God: "That truly we wanted except a goodness, and harmony."
Those are, those who God knows what (is) in their hearts/minds, so object/oppose from them, and preach/advise/warn them , and say to them in themselves an eloquent/sufficient saying.
And We did not sent from a messenger except to be obeyed with God's permission; and if that when they caused injustice/oppression to themselves, they came to you, so they asked for forgiveness (from) God, and the messenger asked for forgiveness for them, they would have found God forgiving, merciful.
So no, and by your Lord, they do not believe, until they appoint you to judge in what quarreled/disputed between them, then they do not find in themselves a strain/blame from what you judged/ordered ,and they submit/surrender submissively/surrenderingly .
And if that We wrote/ordered/decreed on them, that kill yourselves or get out from your homes, they would not have done it, except (a) few from them, and if that they did what they are being advised/warned with it (it) would have been best for them, and strongest affirmation . 
And then We would have given them from at Us a great reward.
And We would have guided them a straight/direct road/way.
And who obeys God and the messenger, so these (are) with those who God blessed on them from the prophets and the always very truthful, and the witnessing/those killed in God's sake , and the correct/righteous, and those are a good helper/supporter/companion/friend.
That (is) the grace/blessing from God, and enough/sufficient with God knowledgeable.
You, you those who believed, take your caution/fear, so rush/hasten (in) groups, or rush/hasten all together.
And that from you who (E) will slow/delay/linger (E) , so if a disaster struck you, he said: "God had blessed on me, when I was not present with them."
And if (E) grace/blessing from God struck you, he will say (E) as if love/affection/friendship was not between you (P), and between him: "Oh, if only I were with them, so I succeed/win a great success/winning/triumph."
So those who volunteer the present world/worldly life with the end (other life) should fight/kill in God's sake, and who fights/kills in God's sake, so he is killed or he defeats/conquers, so We will give him a great reward.
And for what (why) do you not fight/kill in God's sake? And the weakened from the men and the women, and the children/newborns, those who say: "Our Lord, bring us out from this the village/urban city, the unjust/oppressive (to) its people, and make for us from at You a guardian/victorior/ally , and make for us from at You a savior/supporter."
Those who believed, fight/kill in God's sake, and those who disbelieved fight/kill in the devil/idol's sake, so fight/kill the devil's supporters/allies/followers, that the devil's conspiracy/deceit was weak.
Did you not see to those who were said to them: "Prevent/stop your hands and keep up the prayers, and give the charity." So when the fighting/killing was written/decreed on them, then a group from them fear the people, as God's fear, or stronger fear, and they said: "Our Lord, for what (did) You write/decree on us the fighting/killing, if only You delayed us to (a) near term/time." Say: "The present world's enjoyment (is) little, and the end (other life) (is) best to who feared and obeyed, and you do (will) not be caused injustice to/oppressed (as little as) a cleft in a seed ."
Wherever you are, the death catches up/reaches you , and (even) if you were in towers/castles/constellations built/erected , and if a goodness strikes them, they say: "This (is) from at God." And if a sin/crime (harm) strikes them, they say: "This (is) from at you." Say: "All/each (are) from at God, so how those the nation, they almost do not understand an information/speech?"
What struck you from a goodness, so (it is) from at God, and what struck you from a sin/crime (harm) so (it is) from your self, and We sent you to the people, (as) a messenger and enough with God, (as) a witness/present . 
And who obeys the messenger, so he obeyed God, and who turned away, so We did not send you on them (as) a protector .
And they say: "Obedience." So if they emerged from at you, a group from them schemed at night other than what you say, and God writes what they scheme at night, so oppose/turn away from them and rely/depend on God, and enough with God (as) a guardian/protector.
So do they not consider The Koran, and if (it) were from at other than God, they would have found in it much difference/disagreement.
And if a matter/affair from the safety/security or the fear came to them, they spread/circulated with it, and if they returned it to the messenger and to (those) of the order/command from them; those who from them conclude/discover (understand) it would have known it (E), and where it not for God's grace/favour/blessing on you, and His mercy, you would have followed the devil, except a few (from you).
So fight/kill in God's sake, you are not burdened/imposed upon except (with) your self, and instigate/urge/encourage the believers, maybe that God prevents/stops those who disbelieved's might/power, and God (is) stronger power/might, and stronger severe exemplary punishment.
Who mediates a good mediation, for him is a share from it, and who mediates a bad/evil mediation, for him is a share from it, and God was/is on every thing providing.
And if you were greeted with a greeting, so greet with better from (than) it, or return it, that God was/is on every thing counting/calculating.
God, no God except He/Him, He will gather/collect you (E) to the Resurrection Day, no doubt/suspicion in it; and who (is) more truthful from (than) God (in) an information/speech?
So what for you (so why are you being divided) two groups in (regarding) the hypocrites? And God set them back because (of) what they gathered, do you want that to guide who God misguided? And who God misguides, so you will not find for him a path/means.
They wished/loved if you disbelieve, as they disbelieved, so you become equal/alike. So do not take from them allies , until they emigrate in God's sake, so if they turned away, so take/punish them and fight/kill them, where/when you found them, and do not take from them an ally , and nor a supporter/savior.
Except those who reach to (a) nation between you and between them (is) a) covenant (treaty), or they came to you, their chests (are) restricted/depressed , that they fight/kill you, or they fight/kill their nation, and if God wanted/willed, He would have empowered them on you, so they would have fought/killed you (P), so if they separated/isolated themselves from you , so they did not fight/kill you, and they threw (offered) to you the peace/surrender , so God did not make for you on them a path/means.
You will find others, they want that they (be) secured by you (have peace with you), and they be trusted/secured (by) their nation, whenever they are returned to the treason , they were made to be set back/replaced in it, so if they did not separate/ isolate/withdraw themselves from you , and they (did not) throw (offer) to you the peace/surrender , and (nor) they stop their hands, so take them and fight/kill them where/when you defeated them/caught up with them, and those, We made for you on them a clear/evident power .
And (it) was/is not to a believer that he kills a believer except mistakenly, and who killed a believer mistakenly, so freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), and compensation handed over/delivered to his (the victim's) family, except that they give charity (forgive), so if he was from a nation, an enemy for you, and he (the victim was) a believer, so freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), and if he was/is from a nation between you and between them (is) a covenant (treaty), so a compensation handed over/delivered to his (the victim's) family and freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), so who does not find, so fasting two months following each other (E), a repentance from at God, and God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
And who kills a believer intentionally/purposely, so his reward (repayment/retribution is) Hell immortally/eternally in it, and God became angry on him, and He cursed/humiliated him, and He prepared for him a great torture.
You, you those who believed, if you moved in God's sake, so seek clarification/explanation , and do not say to who threw (offered) the peace/surrender/greeting , you are not a believer, you wish/desire the life the present's/worldly life's enjoyable accessories, so at God (are) many winnings/gains/spoils, like that you were from before, so God blessed on you, so seek clarification/explanation, that God was/is with what you make/do expert/experienced.
From the believers the remaining (behind) not/other than those of the difficult circumstances and the struggling/defending for God's sake with their properties and themselves do not become equal, God preferred the struggling/defending with their properties and themselves over the remaining in a stage/degree, and each/all God promised the goodness, and God preferred the struggling/defending above the remaining (by) a great reward.
Stages/degrees from Him and a forgiveness and a mercy, and God was/is a forgiver, merciful.
That those the angels make them die, unjust (to) themselves, they said: "In what you were/have been?" They said: "We were weakened in the Earth/land." They said: "Was not God's Earth/land wide/spacious so you emigrate in it." So those, their shelter/refuge (is) Hell, and it was a bad/evil end/destination.
Except the weakened from the men, and the women, and the children, they are not able (of a) solution (means) and nor they be guided a way/path.
So those, maybe God that He forgives/pardons on them, and God was/is often forgiving, (a) forgiver.
And who emigrates in God's sake, he finds in the earth an escape , and a wealth/an abundance, and who gets out from his house emigrating to God and His messenger, then the death overtakes him, so his reward had fallen/been placed on God, and God was/is a forgiver, merciful.
And if you (P) moved in the Earth/land, so offense/guilt is not on you, that you shorten/reduce from the prayers if you feared that those who disbelieved betray/torture you , that the disbelievers are/were to you an evident, an enemy. (NOTE: THE CONDITION FOR REDUCTION OR SHORTENING OF PRAYERS DURING TRAVEL IN THE PRECEDING VERSE) 
And if you were in them, so you started for them the prayer, so a group from them should stand with you, and they should take their weapons/arms, so if they prostrated, so they be from behind you, and another group should come (that) they did not pray, so they pray (E) with you, and they should take their caution, and their weapons/arms; those who disbelieved, wished if you ignore/neglect your weapons/arms, and your belongings/effects/goods, so they lean on you one bend, and no offense/guilt (is) on you if mild harm was with you from rain or you were sick/diseased, that you lay your weapons/arms, and take your caution, that God prepared to the disbelievers a degrading/humiliating torture.
So if you (P) accomplished the prayers, so mention/remember God standing, and sitting, and on your sides, so if you became secured, so keep up the prayers, that the prayers was/is on the believers decreed (at) appointed times . (NOTE: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PRAYERS, ITS TIMES, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REPEATEDLY MENTIONING GOD THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN THE PRECEDING VERSE)
And do not weaken in asking/desiring the nation, if you are feeling pain, so then they are feeling pain, as/like you feel pain/ache, and you hope/expect from God what they do not hope/expect, and God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
That We have descended to you The Book with the truth to judge/rule between the people with what God showed you, and do not be to the betrayers an arguer .
And ask for God's forgiveness, that God was/is a forgiver, merciful.
And do not argue/dispute about those who betray themselves, that God does not love/like who was/is often betraying/often being unfaithful, a sinner, a criminal.
They hide from the people and they do not hide from God, and He is with them when they scheme at night what He does not accept/approve from the saying, and God was/is with what they do surrounding/enveloping .
Here you are those (who) argued/disputed about them in the life the present/worldly life; so who argues/disputes (with) God about them (in) the Resurrection Day, or who will be on them a guardian/protector ?
And who does bad/evil/harm or causes injustice (to) himself then he asks for forgiveness (from) God, he finds God a forgiver, merciful.
And who acquires/carries a sin/crime , so but he carries it on himself, and God was/is wise/judicious.
And who acquires/carries a sin or a sin/crime , then he blames and accuses an innocent, so he had carried wrongfully/slanderfully and an evident sin/crime .
And where it not for God's grace/favour/blessing on you and His mercy, a group from them resolved/started (E) that (to) misguide you, and they do not misguide except themselves, and they do not harm you from a thing, and God descended on you The Book and the wisdom, and He taught you, what you did (and) were not to know, and God's grace/favour on you was/is great. 
(There is) no goodness in much from their confidential talk/secret conversation, except who ordered/commanded with charity or kindness or reconciliation between the people, and who does that asking/desiring God's satisfactions, so We will give him a great reward.
And who defies/makes animosity with the messenger from after the guidance was clarified to him and he follows other than the believers' way/path, We enable him what he followed , and We roast/make him suffer Hell, and it was a bad end/destination.
That God does not forgive that He be made a partner with Him, and He forgives what (is) other than that to whom He wants/wills, and who shares/makes partners with God, so he had misguided a distant misguidance.
That they call from other than Him except females, and that they call except a rebellious/evil devil .
God cursed him , and he (the devil) said: "I will take (E) from your worshippers/slaves a specified share."
And I will misguide them (E), and I will make them desire (E), and I will order/command them (E), so they will cut (E) the animals'/livestock's ears, and I will order/command them (E), so they will change (E) God's creation. And who takes the devil (as) a guardian/ally from other than God, so he had lost an evident loss.

The Book's people ask/question you, that to descend on them a book from the sky/space, so they had asked Moses greater than that, so they said: "Show us God publicly/openly." So the fire falling from the sky accompanied by thunderous noise punished/took them with their injustice/oppression, then they took the calf from after what came to them (from) the evidences, so We forgave/pardoned on that, and We gave Moses evident proof .
And We raised above them the Mountain with their promise/covenant, and We said to them: "Enter the door/entrance prostrating". And We said to them: "Do not transgress/violate in the Saturday/Sabbath". And We took from them a strong promise/covenant.
So with what their breaking/breaching (of) their promise/covenant, and their disbelief with God's signs/verses/evidences, and their killing (of) the prophets, without right , and their saying: "Our hearts/minds (are) covered/uncomprehending." But God stamped/covered/closed/sealed on it, with their disbelief, so they do not believe except a few.

That We inspired/transmitted to you, as We inspired/transmitted to Noah and the prophets from after him, and We inspired/transmitted to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Issac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren/Jewish tribes, and Jesus, and Job, and Jonah and Aaron, and Solomon, and We gave David a Book.
And messengers We had narrated/relayed them to you from before, and messengers We did not narrate/relay about them on you, and God conversed/spoke (to) Moses conversationally/speechfully . 
Messengers, announcers of good news and warners/givers of notice, for that (there is) no proof/argument be to the people on God after the messengers, and God was/is glorious/mighty, wise/judicious.
But God witnesses/testifies with what He descended to you, He descended it with His knowledge, and the angels witness/testify, and enough with God (as) a witness.
That those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from God's way/path, they had misguided a distant/far misguidance.
That those who disbelieved and caused injustice/oppression, God was not to forgive for them, and nor to guide them a way/path .
Except Hell's way/path, immortally/eternally in it forever, and that was/is on God easy/little.

Stop (it is) best for you, but God (is) one God, His praise/glory that to be for him a child; for Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, enough/sufficient with God (as a) guardian/protector .
The Messiah will never/not refuse/reject that to be a slave/worshipper to God, and nor the angels the neared/close, and who refuses/rejects from worshipping Him, and becomes arrogant, so He will gather them to Him all together.
So but those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so He fulfills/completes (to) them their rewards , and He increases them from His grace/favour, and but those who refused/rejected and were arrogant, so He tortures them a painful torture, and they do not find for them from other than God, a guardian/ally , and nor a victorior/savior .
You, you the people, a proof had come to you from your Lord, and We descended to you a clear/evident light.
So but those who believed with God, and they held fast with Him, so He will enter them in a mercy from Him, and grace/favour, and guide them a straight/direct road/way to Him.
They ask your opinion/clarification , say: "God decrees/decides in the man or woman without a son/father , if (a) man/human died, not for him (without) a child, and for him (is) a sister, so for her half (of) what he left, and he inherits her if (there) was not for her a child, and if they (B) were two (F), so to them (B/F) the two thirds from what he left, and if they were brothers (siblings) men and women, so to the male equal/alike (the) share (of) the two females, God clarifies for you that (E) you (not) be misguided, and God is with every thing knowledgeable. 
You, you those who believed, fulfill/complete with the contracts; four legged creatures of land and sea except lions (beasts) (of) the camel/livestock is permitted/allowed for you, except what is read/recited on you, not permitting/allowing the hunt/fishing and you are forbidden/respecting for pilgrimage , that God judges/rules what He wills/wants.

Forbidden on you is the animal whose death was caused by suffocation or strangulation, and the blood, and the pig's/swine's flesh/meat, and what was declared/praised the name of whom the sacrifice was made for to other than God with it, and the strangled/choked to death, and the beaten to death/dead due to sickness, and the fallen/destroyed/perished (to death), and the animal whose death was caused by another's horns , and what the beast or bird of prey ate (from), except what you slaughtered, and what was slaughtered on the slaughter places, and that you seek oath with the featherless arrows , that (is) debauchery ; today those who disbelieved despair from your religion, so do not fear them, and fear Me, today I completed for you your religion, and I completed on you My blessing , and I accepted/approved for you the Islam (as) a religion, so who was forced in hunger, not deviating from righteousness/justice to a sin/crime, so that God was/is forgiving, merciful.
They ask/question you what became permitted (allowed) for them, say: "Permitted/allowed for you (are) the goodnesses, and what you taught from the predatory animals, hunting birds and hunting dogs, training for hunting and retrieving , you teach them (F) from what God taught/instructed you, so eat from what they (F) held/grasped/seized on (for) you, and mention/remember God's name on it, and fear and obey God, that God (is) quick/fast (in) the counting/calculating."
Today is permitted/allowed for you the goodnesses, and those who were given The Book's food is permitted/allowed for you, and your food is permitted/allowed for them, and the chaste (F) from the believers (F), and the chaste (F) from those who were given The Book from before you, if you gave them (F) their (F) fees (dowries), marrying not fornicating/adulterating, and not taking friends/lovers , and who disbelieves with the faith/belief, so his deed had wasted/failed, and he (is) in the end (other life) from the losers .
You, you those who believed, if you started/got up to the prayers, so wash with water your faces, and your hands to the elbows, and rub/wipe with your heads and your feet to the two joints/ankle bones, and if you wereimpure/unclean , so be purified/cleaned , and if you were sick/diseased or on (a) journey/trip/voyage or one of you came from the safe hidden depression in the ground (toilet), or you touched and felt repeatedly the women, so you did not find water, so wipe your hands and face with dust good/pure dust, so rub/wipe with your faces and your hands from it, God does not want to make/put on you strain/hardship, and but He wants to purify you mentally and physically and to complete (E) His blessing on you, maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
And remember/mention God's blessing/goodness on you, and His entrustment that He entrusted you with it, when you said: "We heard/listened and we obeyed." And fear and obey God, that God (is) knowledgeable within the innermosts (chests).
You, you those who believed, be just/upright to God, witnessing/testifying with the just/equitable, and (let) not a nation's hatred and animosity make you commit a crime/sin , on (because) that you not be just/equitable, be just/equitable it is nearer/closer to the fear and obedience (of God), and fear and obey God, that God is expert/experienced with what you make/do.
God promised those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them forgiveness and a great wage/reward.
And those who disbelieved and denied/falsified with Our signs/verses/evidences, those are the roaring fire's/Hell's company.
You, you those who believed, remember/mention God's blessing/goodness on you, when a nation started that they spread/extend their hands to you, so He prevented/stopped their hands from you, and fear and obey God, and on God so should the believers rely on/trust in.
And God had taken Israel's sons' and daughters' promise/covenant, and We sent from them twelve heads/chiefs/representatives, and God said: "I am with you, if (E) you kept up the prayers, and you gave the charity/purification, and you believed with My messengers and you supported/aided them, and you lent/advanced God a good loan/advance, I will substitute (E) from you your sins/crimes and I will enter you (E) treed gardens the rivers flow from beneath it, so who disbelieved after that, from you, so (he) had misguided the way's/path's straightness."
So because (of) what their breaking/breaching their promise/covenant, We cursed them and We made their hearts cruel/merciless, they alter/distort the words/expressions from its places, and they forgot (a) fortune (share) from what they were reminded with it, and do you not still/continue to know/see on a betrayal/unfaithfulness from them, except (a) few from them, so forg ive/pardon on them and forgive/pardon, that God loves/likes the good doers.
And from those who said: "We are Christians." We took their promise/covenant, so they forgot a luck (share) from what they were reminded with it, so We urged/excited to stir up between them the animosity and the intense hatred to the Resurrection Day, and God will inform them with what they were performing/producing.
You The Book's people, Our messenger had come to you, he clarifies/shows to you much from what you were hiding from The Book, and He forgives/pardons from much, a light and clear/evident Book had come to you from God.
God guides with it who followed His satisfaction, the security's/peace's ways/paths, and He brings them out from the darknesses to the light with His permission, and He guides them to a straight/direct road/way.
Those who said: "That God, He is the Messiah Mary's son." had disbelieved, say: "So who owns/possesses from God a thing, if He wanted that He destroys the Messiah, Mary's son, and his mother, and who (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all together? And to God (are) the skies/space and what (is) between them (B)'s ownership/kingdom , He creates what He wills/wants, and God (is) on every thing capable ."
And the Jews and the Christians said: "We are God's sons and His most loved." say: "So why He tortures you because of your crimes? But you are humans from what He created, He forgives to whom He wills/wants, and He tortures who He wills/wants, and to God (are) the skies/space, and the earth/Planet Earth, and what (is) between them (B)'s ownership/kingdom, and to Him (is) the end/destination."
You The Book's people, a messenger had come to you, he clarifies/shows to you, on an intermission from the messengers, that you say: "From (an) announcer of good news did not come to us, and nor a warner/giver of notice." So (an) announcer and a warner/giver of notice had come to you, and God was/is on every thing capable/able.
And when Moses said to his nation: "You my nation mention/remember God's blessing/goodness on you when He put/created between you prophets, and He made you kings, and he gave you what he did not give anyone from the creations altogether/(universes).
You my nation, enter the earth the Holy that God wrote/dictated for you, and do not return on your backs, so you turn around losers ."
They said: "You Moses, that in it (is) a nation (of) tyrants/rebels , and that we will never/not enter it until they get out from it, so if they get out from it, so we are entering."
Two men from those who fear (and) God blessed/comforted and eased on them (B), said: "Enter on them (through) the door/entrance, so if you entered it, so that you are defeating/conquering, and on God so rely/depend , if you were/are believers."
They said: "You Moses, we are never entering it, never, as long as they continued/lasted in it, so go you, and your Lord, so you both fight/kill, we are here, here sitting/remaining."
(Moses) said: "My Lord, that I do not own/possess except myself and my brother, so separate between us and between the nation the debauchers ."
(God) said: "So that it truly is forbidden/prohibited on them forty years, they stray/wander in the earth/Planet Earth, so do not grieve on the nation the debauchers ."
And read/recite on them (the) information/news (of) Adam's two sons with the truth , when they (B) approached/neared an approachment to God (an offering), so (it) was accepted from one of them (B) and was not (to) be accepted from the other, he said: "I will kill you (E)." He said: "But, God accepts from the fearing and obeying."
If (E) you spread/extended to me your hand to kill me, I am not with spreading/extending my hands to you to kill you, that I fear God, the creations altogether's/(universes') Lord.
I want that you return with my sin/crime and your sin/crime, so you be from the fire's company, and that (is) the unjust's/oppressor's reimbursement .
So his self consented for him, his brother's killing/murdering, so he killed him, so he became from the losers.
So God sent a crow digging/searching in the earht/Planet Earth, to show him how (he) hides/conceals his brother's shameful genital private part to be covered, he said: "Oh my calamity , have I been unable that I be similar/like that the crow, so I hide/conceal my brother's shameful genital private part to be covered?" So he became from the regretful/sorrowful/remorseful.
Because of that, We wrote/decreed on Israel's sons and daughters, that who killed a self without a self, or corruption in the earth/Planet Earth, so (it is) as if he killed the people all/all together , and who revived (saved) it, so as if he revived (saved) the people all/all together, and Our messengers had come to them with the evidences, then that many from them, after that (are) in the earth/Planet Earth spoilers/wasters (E) .
But (the) reward (of) those who embattle/fight God and His messenger, and they strive/endeavor in the earth/Planet Earth corruption/disorder , that they be killed or they be crucified , or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposites, or they be expelled/exiled from the land, that (is) for them shame/scandal/disgrace in the present world, and for them in the end (other life is) a great torture.
Except those who repented from before that you become overpowering on them, so know that God (is) a forgiver, merciful.
You, you those who believed, fear and obey God, and ask/wish to him the means to approach , and struggle in His way/path (sake), maybe you succeed/win.
That those who disbelieved, if that for them what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all together, and similar/equal to it, with it to ransom/compensate with it from the Resurrection Day's torture, (it) would not be accepted from them, and to them (is) a painful torture.
They want that they get out from the fire, and they are not with getting out from it, and for them (is) a continuing torture.
And the male thief/robber and the female thief/robber, so cut off their (B)'s hands, a reward because (of) what they (B) gathered/acquired , severe exemplary punishment from God, and God (is) glorious/mighty ,wise/judicious .
So who repented from after his injustice/oppression, and he corrected , so that God forgives on him, that God (is) a forgiving, merciful.
Did you not know that God, (has) for Him the skies'/space's, and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership , He tortures whom He wills/wants, and He forgives to whom He wills/wants, and God (is) on every thing capable/able.
You, you the messenger, do not be saddened (by) those who quicken/speed in the disbelief, from those who said: "We believed" with their mouths, and their hearts/minds did not believe, and from those who repented/Jews (who are) often listening/hearing to the lie/falsehood, (and) often listening/hearing to other nations (that) they did not come to you, they alter/distort the words/expressions from after its places, they say: "If you were given that, so take it , and if you were not given it, so be warned ." And whom God wants testing him , so you will never own/possess for him from God a thing, those are those who God did not want that to purify their hearts/minds , for them in the present world (is) shame/scandal/ disgrace, and for them in the end (other life is) a great torture.
(They are) often listening/hearing to the lie/falsehood, gluttons/eating exaggeratedly to the forbidden/possession through cheatery , so if they came to you, so judge/rule between them or turn away from them, and if you turn away from them, so they will never/not harm you (in) a thing, and if you judged/ruled, so judge/rule between them with the just/equitable, that God loves/likes the just/equitable.
And how (do) they ask you to judge/rule, and at them (is) the Torah/Old Testament, in it (is) God's judgment/rule, then they turn away from after that, and those are not with the believing.
That We descended the Torah/Old Testament, in it (is) guidance and light, the prophets those who submitted/surrendered , judge/rule with it, to those who guided/Jews , and the knowledgeable Lord worshippers , and the religious scholars with what they memorized/safe kept (learned) from God's Book , and they were not on it witnessing/present ; so do not fear the people and fear Me, and do not buy/volunteer with My signs/verses a small price, and who does not judge/rule with what God descended, so those, they are the disbelievers.
And We wrote/decreed on them in it, that the self (is) with the self, and the eye (is) with the eye, and the nose (is) with the nose, and the ear (is) with the ear, and the tooth (is) with the tooth, and the wounds/cuts (are) equal revenge/punishment equal to crime, so who gave charity (forgave) with it, so it is cover/substitution for him, and who does not judge/rule with what God descended, so those, those are the unjust/oppressors.
And We sent after (following) on their tracks with Jesus, Mary's son confirming for what (is) between his hands from the Torah/Old Testament, and We gave him the New Testament/Bible in it (is) guidance and light, and confirming to what (is) between his hands from the Torah/Old Testament, and guidance and a sermon/advice/warning to the fearing and obeying.
And the New Testament's/Bible's people should judge/rule with what God descended in it, and who does not judge/rule with what God descended, so those, they are the debauchers .
And We descended to you The Book with the truth , confirming to what (is) between his hands from The Book , and guarding/protecting on it, so judge/rule between them with what God descended and do not follow their self attractions for desires about what came to you from the truth, to each from you We made/put God's decreed way of life/method/law and order , and a clear/easy/plain way , and if God wanted/willed, He would have made you one nation/generation, and but to test you in what He gave you, so race/surpass (to) the goodnesses/generosity (good deeds), to God (is) your return altogether, so He informs you with what you were in it differing/disagreeing (P).
And that judge/rule between them with what God descended, and do not follow their self attractions for desires , and be warned/cautious of them, that they test/misguide you from some/part (of) what God descended to you, so if they turned away, so know that God wants that (He) strikes/hits them with some/part (of) their crimes, and that many of the people (are) debauchers (E) .
Is (it) the Pre-Islamic paganism's/ignorance's judgment/rule (that) they desire ? And who (is) better than God (in) judgment/ruling to a nation they be sure/certain?
You, you those who believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians (as) guardians/patrons , some of them (are) guardians/patrons (of) some, and who follows them from you, so that he truly is from them, that God does not guide the nation, the unjust/oppressive.
So you see those who in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease, they rush/speed in (to) them, they say: "We fear that disaster strikes/hits us, so maybe that God comes with the victory or an order/matter from at Him." So they become on what they kept secret in themselves regretful .
And those who believed, say: "Are those, those who swore by God their right's/oath's utmost that they (are) with you (E), their deeds wasted, so they became losers .
You, you those who believed, who returns from you from his religion, so God will come with a nation, He loves/likes them, and they love/like Him, on the believers humble , more glorious/mighty on the disbelievers, they struggle in God's sake , and they do not fear a blamer's/reprimanders's blame/reprimand, that (is) God's grace/favour, He gives it (to) whom He wills/wants, and God (is) rich/abundant , knowledgeable.
But your guardian/patron/ally (is) God, and His messenger; and those who believed they keep up the prayers, and they give the charity , and they are bowing .
And who follows God and His messenger and those who believed, so that God's group/party, they are the defeaters/conquerors.
You, you those who believed, do not take those who took your religion mockingly and playing/amusement from those who were given The Book from before you, and the disbelievers (as) guardians/patrons/allies , and fear and obey God, if you were believing.
And if you called to (for) the prayers, they took it mockingly and playing/amusement, that (is) with that they are a nation (that) do not reason/understand/comprehend.
Say: "You The Book's people, do (you) revenge/hate from us, except (because) that we believed with God, and what was descended to us, and what was descended from before, and that most of you (are) debauchers ."
Say: "Do I inform you with worse/more hateful than that? Replacement/compensation (from) at God, whom God cursed/humiliated , and He became angry/angered (at) on him, and He made/created from them the apes/monkeys and the pigs/swine , and the everything worshipped other than God's/devil's worshippers, those (are at) a worse place/position and more misguided, from the way's/road's middle/straightness."
And if they came to you, they said: "We believed". And they had entered with the disbelief, and they, they had gotten out with it, and God (is) more knowing with what they were hiding/concealing."
And you see many from them, quickening/rushing in the sin/crime, and the transgression/aggression ,and their eating the forbidden/possessions acquired through cheatery , how bad (E) (is) what they were making/doing?
If only the knowledgeable lord worshippers and the religious scholars forbid/prevent them from their saying the sin/crime and their eating the forbidden/possessions acquired through cheatery ; how bad (E) (is) what they were producing/manufacturing ?
And the Jews said: "God's hand (is) chained or tied." (But) their hands (are) chained or tied, and they were cursed/humiliated because (of) what they said, but His two hands (are) outspread/outstretched , He spends how (as) He wills/wants; and what was descended to you from your Lord increases (E) many of them tyranny/arrogance and disbelief, and We threw between them the animosity and the intense hatred to the Resurrection Day, whenever they ignited a fire to the battle/war , God extinguished it , and they strive/hasten in the earth/Planet Earth (in) corruption , and God does not love/like the corrupting.
And if that The Book's people believed and feared and obeyed We would have substituted from them their sins/crimes, and We would have entered them the blessing's gardens.
And if that they took care of the Torah/Old Testament, and the Bible/New Testament and what was descended to them from their Lord, they would have eaten from above them and from below their feet; from them (is) a nation economizing/moderate , and many from them what they were making/doing became bad/evil/harmful.
You, you the messenger deliver/inform what was descended to you from your Lord, and if you did not make/do (that) so you did not reach (pass) His message, and God protects/shelters you from the people, that God does not guide the nation, the disbelieving.
Say: "You The Book's people, you are not on a thing, until you keep up the Torah/Old Testament and the Bible/New Testament , and what was descended to you from your (P) Lord." And what was descended to you (S/M) from your Lord increases (E) many of them tyranny/arrogance, and disbelief, so do not grieve/sadden on the nation, the disbelieving.
That those who believed and those who guided/Jews , and the converts/Sabians , and the Christians who believed with God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and made/worked correct/righteous deeds, so no fear on them, and nor they be sad/grieving.
We had taken Israel's sons' and daughters' promise/covenant, and We sent to them messengers, whenever a messenger came to them with what their selves do not desire, a group (some) they denied, and a group (some) they kill.
And they thought, that test/torture (is) not (to) be, so they became blinded/confused , and they became deaf, then God forgave on them, then they blinded/confused and they deafened many (of) them, and God (is) seeing/knowing/understanding with what they make/do/work.
Those who said: "That God, He is the Messiah Mary's son," had disbelieved, and the Messiah, said: "You, Israel's sons and daughters, worship God, my Lord and your Lord, that he who shares/makes partners with God, so He had forbidden on him the Paradise, and his shelter/refuge (is) the fire , and (there are) no victoriors/saviors to the unjust/oppressors." 
Those who said: "That God (is) third (of) three." had disbelieved, and (there is) no God except from one God, and if they do not end/stop from what they say, a painful torture will touch (E) those who disbelieved from them.
So do they not repent to God, and they ask Him for forgiveness, and God (is) forgiving, merciful.
The Messiah Mary's son is not except a messenger, the messengers had past/expired from before Him, and his mother (was) always very truthful, they were (B) eating the food; look/see how We clarify/explain to them the signs/evidences, then look/see where they be turned away .
Say: "Do you worship from other than God what does not own/possess for you harm and nor benefit, and God He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable."
Say: "You The Book's people, do not exaggerate/exceed the limit in your religion, other than the truth , and do not follow a nation's self attractions for desires , they had misguided from before and they misguided many, and they misguided from the way's/path's middle/straightness."
Those who disbelieved from Israel's sons and daughters were cursed/humiliated on David's and Jesus Mary's son's tongue, that (is) with what they disobeyed, and they were transgressing/violating .
They were not forbidding/preventing each other from awfulness/obscenity they made/did it; how bad (is) what they were making/doing?
You see many from them, they follow those who disbelieved, how bad (is) what their selves advanced/understood for them, that God became angry/dissatisfied on them, and in the torture they are immortally/eternally .
And if they were believing with God, and the prophet and what was descended to him, they would not (have) taken them (as) guardians/allies , and but many from them (are) debauchers .
You will find (E) the strongest people (with) animosity to those who believed (are) the Jews, and those who shared/made partners (with God), and you will find (E) their nearest/closest love/friendship , to those who believed, (are) those who said: "That we are Christian ." That (is) with that from them (are) priests/clergymen and monks, and that they are not being arrogant.
And if they heard what was descended to the messenger, you see their eyes flow from the tears from what they knew from the truth , they say: "Our Lord, we believed, so write us with the witnessing/testifying."
And why not for us to believe with God and what came to us from the truth , and we wish/desire that our Lord makes us enter with the nation the correct/righteous.
So God rewarded them because (of) what they said treed gardens, the rivers flow from beneath it, immortally/eternally in it, and that (is) the good doer's reward .
And those who disbelieved and they denied with Our verses/signs/evidences, those are the Hell's people
You, you those who believed, do not forbid/prohibit goodnesses (from) what God permitted/allowed for you, and do not transgress/violate , that God does not love/like the transgressors/violators.
And eat from what God provided for you, permitted/allowed, good/enjoyable , and fear and obey God, whom you are with (in) him believing.
God does not punish you with the nonsense/useless talk in your oaths, and but He punishes you with what you intended (in) the oaths, so its cover/substitution (is) feeding ten poorest of poor/poor oppressed from middle (average of) what you feed your families , or their dressing/clothing, or feeding/liberating a neck/person/slave, so who does not find, so fasting three days, that (is) cover/substitution (for) your oaths, if you swore/took oath, and guard your oaths, like that God clarifies to you His verses/evidences, maybe you thank/be grateful.
You, you those who believed, that the intoxicants , and the gambling and the monuments , and the featherless arrows (are) sin/crime from the devil's making/work, so avoid it , maybe you succeed/win.
But the devil wants that he makes the animosity and the intense hatred fall between you, in (through use of) the intoxicants and the gambling, and he prevents/obstructs you from God's remembrance/reminder, and from the prayers, so are you ending/stopping?
And obey God and obey the messenger, and be warned/cautious, so if you turned away, so know that truly on Our messengers (is) the information/communication, the clear/evident .
(An) offense/guilt is not on those who believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds in what they ate/tasted, if as long as they feared and obeyed and believed and they made/did the correct/righteous deeds, then they feared and obeyed and they believed, and then they feared and obeyed, and they did good and God loves/likes the good doers.
You, you those who believed, God will test you (E) with something from the hunt/fishing/trapping, your hands and your spears/lances take/receive/obtain (reach) it, (for) God (is) to know who fears Him with the unseen , so who transgressed/violated after that, so for him (is) a painful torture.
You, you those who believed, do not kill the hunt/trapping, and you are forbidden/respecting for pilgrimage, and who intentionally/purposely killed it from you, so a reimbursement equal/similar (to) what he killed from the properties/livestock (the animals/birds), (two) of (B) justice/equality from you judges/rules with it (as) an offering reaching/delivered (to) the Kaaba , or substitution (of) feeding (the) poorest of poor/poor oppressed (P), or redemption (of) that (is) fasting , to taste/experience his matter's/affair's severity/bad consequences/evil results, God forgave/pardoned on what preceded, and who returned (again), so God revenges from Him, and God (is) glorious/mighty , (owner) of revenge.
Permitted/allowed for you is the sea's hunting/fishing, and its food, enjoyment to you and to the caravan/people often moving , and forbidden on you (is) the shore's/land's hunting/trapping as long as you continued in compliance with pilgrimage prohibitions , and fear and obey God, who to Him you are being gathered.
God put/made the Kaaba, the House/Home the Respected/Sacred standing to (for) the people and the forbidden/sacred the month and the offering and the necklaces , that to know that God knows what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and that God (is) with every thing knowledgeable.
Know that God (is) strong (severe in) the punishment and that God (is) forgiving, merciful.
Nothing (is) on the messenger except the information/communication, and God knows what you show and what you hide/conceal. 
Say: "The bad/spoiled and the good/pure do not become equal/alike, and even if it pleased/marveled you the bad's/spoiled's plentifulness, so fear and obey God, you (owners) of the pure minds/intelligences ,maybe/perhaps you win/succeed."
You, you those who believed, do not question/ask about things, if (it) appears to you, it harms you , and if you ask/question about it a time (when) the Koran descends (it) appears to you, God forgave/pardoned about it, and God (is) forgiving/clement.
A nation from before you had asked/questioned (about) it, then they became with it disbelieving.
God did not make/create from a female camel in Pre-Islamic paganism whose ears were split after five deliveries and left to roam alone for their idols and of no benefit to man , and nor a female camel in Pre-Islamic paganism which gave birth to ten female litters and left to roam and feed freely and forbidden from use , and nor a female camel who gave birth seven times and was left to roam and not be slaughtered , and nor a male camel who fathered ten deliveries and was left to roam without benefit to man , and but those who disbelieved they fabricate on God the lies/falsehood, and most of them do not reason/understand/comprehend. (DISCREPANCY EXISTS ABOUT THE PRECEDING BOLD TERM)
And if (it) was said to them: "Come to what God descended and to the messenger." They said: "Enough for us what we found our fathers on it." And even if their fathers were not knowing a thing and nor being guided.
You, you those who believed, on you (are) yourselves, who misguided does not harm you if you were guided, to God (is) your return all together, so He informs you with what you were making/doing .
You, you those who believed testimony between you if the death attended any of you (at the) time of the bequest/will (bring) two of justice from you or two others from other than you, if you, you moved/mixed in the Earth/land, so the death's/liflessness's disaster struck you , you prevent/withhold them (B) from after the prayers, so they (B) swear/make oath with God: "If you become doubtful/suspicious we do not buy volunteer (ourselves) with it a price, and even if (he or she was) of the relations/near, and we do not hide/conceal God's witness/certification , that we are then from (E) the sinners/criminals."
So if (it) was stumbled upon (found) on that they (B) deserved (B) (committed) a sin/crime, so two others they (B) stay in their (B)'s place/position from those who deserved on them the first two, so they (B) swear/make oath with God (that) "Our testimony/certification (is) more worthy/deserving from (than) their (B)'s testimony/certification, and we did not transgress/violate/break, (and if we did) that we (are) then from (E) the unjust/oppressors (P)."
That (is) nearer that they come with the testimony/certification on its face/direction , or they fear that oaths be returned after their oaths, and fear and obey God and hear/listen, and God does not guide the nation the debauchers .
A day God gathers/collects the messengers, so he says: "What were you answered/replied?" They said: "No knowledge for us, that you (are) knower (of) the unseens/hiddens (unknown)."
when God said: "You Jesus Mary's son, remember My blessing on you and on your mother, when I supported you with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit, you speak/converse (to) the people in the crib/cradle and aged approximately between thirty to fifty years , and when I taught/instructed/informed you The Book , and the wisdom , and the Torah/Old Testament, and the New Testament/Bible , and when you create as a shape/form (of) the bird/birds with My permission, so you blow in it, so it will be flying/birds, with My permission, and you cure and heal the blind/born blind, and the leper with My permission, and when you bring out the deads with My permission, and when I prevented/stopped Israel's sons and daughters from you, when you came to them with the evidences, so those who disbelieved from them said: "That that (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery."
And when I inspired to the supporters and deciples that believe in Me and My messenger, they said: "We believed and witness with that we truly (are) submitters/surrenderers ."
When the supporters and Deciples said: "You, Jesus Mary's son, is your Lord able that He descends on us a table with food from the sky?" He said: "Fear and obey God if you were believing."
They said: "We want that we eat from it, and our hearts/minds (be) assured , and we know that you had been truthful to us, and we be on it from the present/witnessing."
Jesus, Mary's son said: "Oh God, our Lord, descend on us a table with food from the sky, (it) be for us a repeat/feast/festival to our beginning/first and our last/end, and a sign/evidence from You, and provide for us, and You are the provider's best ."
God said: "That I am descending it on you, so who disbelieves after (this) from you, so I am I (will) torture him, a torture, I do (will) not torture it anyone from the creations altogether/(universes)."
And when God said: "You Jesus Mary's son, did you say to the people 'Take me and my mother (as) two gods from other than God?' He (Jesus) said: 'Your praise/glory, (it) is not to be for me that I say what is not for me with (a) right/truth, if I was (had) said it, so You had known it, You know what (is) in my self, and I do not know what (is) in Your self, that You, You (are) all knower (of) the unseens/hidden (unknown).'"
'I did not say to them except what You ordered/commanded me with it, that worship God, my Lord and your Lord, and I was on them a witness as long as I continued/lasted in (between) them, so when You made me die, You were the guard on them, and you (are) on every thing (an) honest witness.'
'If You torture them, so that they are Your worshippers/slaves, and if You forgive for them, so that You are the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious .'
God said: "That (is a) day, the truthful their truthfulness benefits (them), for them (are) treed gardens, the rivers flow from beneath it, (they are) immortally/eternally in it, forever, God approved on them, and they approved on Him, that (is) the great winning/salvation ."
To God (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership , and what (is) in them (F), and He (is) on every thing capable  
The praise/gratitude (is) to God, who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He made/created the darknesses and the light, then those who disbelieved with their Lord make equals (to Him).
He is who created you from mud/clay , then He passed judgment/ordered a term/time, and (a) term/time identified (specified) at Him, then you are arguing/doubting.
And He is God in the skies/space and in the earth/Planet Earth, He knows your secret and your publicized ,and He knows what you gain/acquire.
And no verse/evidence from their Lord's verses/evidences comes to them except they were from it objecting/opposing.
So they had denied/lied with the truth when it came to them, so information/news (of) what they were with it mocking/making fun of will come to them.
Did they not see/understand how many from before them We destroyed from (a) people of one era/generation/century, We highly positioned them in the earth/Planet Earth, what We did not highly position for you, and We sent the sky/space on them flowing/pouring abundantly, and We made the rivers flow from beneath them, so We destroyed them, because of their crimes, and We created from after them others (another) people of one era/generation/century.
And if We descended on you (S/M) a Book in paper/parchment, so they touched/touched and felt it with their hands, those who disbelieved would have said: "That that (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery."
And they said: "If only (an) angel was descended on him." And if We descended an angel, the matter/affair would have been executed/ended , then they (would) not be given time/delayed .
And if We made him an angel, We would have made him a man, We would have dressed on him (from) what they dress.
And had been mocked at messengers from before you, so those who mocked from them were afflicted/surrounded with what they were with it mocking/making fun.
Say: "Walk/move in the Earth/land, then look/wonder about how was the liars'/falsifiers' end/turn (result)."
Say: "To whom, what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth?" Say: "To God, He decreed on Himself the mercy, He will gather/collect you to the Resurrection Day, no doubt/suspicion in it, those who lost themselves, so they are not believing."
And for Him (is) what settled in the night and the daytime, and He (is) the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
Say: "Is other than God, I take (as) a guardian , (the) creator (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He feeds and is not fed." Say: "I was ordered/commanded that I be first (of) who surrendered/submitted, and do not be (E) from the sharers/takers of partners (with God)."
Say: "That I, I fear if I disobeyed my Lord (from) a great day's torture."
Who is diverted from it (on) that day, so He had mercy upon him, and that (is) the clear/evident success/triumph.
And if God touches you with harm, so (there is)no remover/uncoverer for it except He, and if He touches you with goodness , so He is on every thing capable.
And He is the defeater/conqueror over His worshippers/slaves, and He is the wise/judicious, the expert/experienced.
Say: "Which thing (is) greater (in) testimony/certification ?" Say: "God (is an) honest witness between me and between you (P), and (it is) transmitted/revealed to me this the Koran, to warn you with it and who (was) reached (informed); that you are witnessing/testifying (E), that with God, (are) other Gods." Say: "I do not witness/testify." Say: "But He is one God, and that I am innocent from what you share (with God)."
Those whom We brought to (gave) them The Book , they know it as they know their sons, those who lost themselves, so they do not believe.
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on God lies/falsifications or denied/falsified with His verses/evidences, that He does not (allow) the unjust/oppressors (to) succeed/win.
And a day We gather them all together, then We say to those who shared (with God): "Where (are) your partners (Idols with God), those who you were claiming/supporting?"
Then their false tales/misguidance (excuse was not), except that they said: "By God, our Lord, we were not sharing (with God)."
See/look how they lied on (to) themselves, and what they were fabricating (was) wasted/lost from them.
And from them who listens to you, and We put on their hearts/minds covers/protections, that they (not) understand/learn it, and in their ears deafness/heaviness, and if they see every evidence/sign/verse, they do not believe with it until when/if they came to you arguing/disputing with you, those who disbelieved, say: "That that (is) except the first's/beginner's myths ."
And they forbid/prevent from it, and they go far from it, and that they truly destroy (non) except themselves, and they do not feel/know.
And if you see/understand, if they were suspended/stood on the fire, so they said: "Oh, if only we be returned and we not lie/deny/falsify with our Lord's verses/evidences, and we be from the believers."
But/rather it appeared to them what they were hiding from before, and even if they were returned they would have returned (repeated) to what they were forbidden prevented from it, and that they truly are lying/denying/falsifying (E).
And they said: "That truly it is except our life the present life/worldly life, we are not with being resurrected/revived."
And if you see/understand if they stopped/arrested at their Lord, he said: "Is that not with the truth/real ?" They said: "Yes/certainly, by our Lord." He said: "So taste/experience the torture, with what you were disbelieving."
Those who denied had lost with God's meeting until when the Hour/Resurrection came to them suddenly, they said: "Oh, our grief/sorrow on what we neglected/wasted in it." And they are carrying their sins on their backs, is it not evil/harmful what they carry/bear?
And the life the present/worldly life is not except playing/amusement/enjoyment and play things , and (the) end's (other life's) house/home (E) (is) better to those who fear and obey, so do you not reason/understand?
We had known that it saddens you (E) what they say, so they truly do not deny you, and but the unjust/oppressors, (are) disbelieving and denying with God's verses/evidences.
And messengers from before you had been lied to/denied, so they were patient on what they were denied (rejected) and they were harmed mildly, until Our victory/aid came to them, and (there is) no exchanger to God's words/expressions; and from the messengers' information/news had come to you.
And if their objection/opposition has become a burden on you, so if you were able, that (E) you desire/wish a tunnel in the earth/Planet Earth, or a ladder in the sky/space, so you come to them with a verse/evidence, and if God wanted/willed He would have gathered/collected them on the guidance, so do not be (E) from the ignorant/lowly (P).
But those who hear/listen answer/reply, and the deads, God sends/resurrects/revives them, then to Him they return.
And they said: "If only a sign/verse/evidence was descended on him from his Lord." Say: "That God (is) capable that on to descend a sign/verse/evidence." And but most of them do not know.
And (there is) not from a walker/creeper/crawler (creature) in the earth/Planet Earth and nor (a) bird (that) flies with its two wings, except (they are) nations similar/equal to you, We did not neglect/waste in The Book from a thing, then to their Lord they be gathered.
And those who lied/denied with Our verses/signs/evidences (they are) deaf and mute in the darknesses; whom God wants/wills He misguides him, and whom He wants/wills, He puts him on a straight/direct road/way
Say: "Did I show you/make you understand, if God's torture came to you, or the Hour/Resurrection came to you, is (it) other than God you call, if you are/were truthful?"
But (only) Him you call, so He removes/uncovers what you call to (for) it, if He wants/wills, and you forget what you share/make partners (with God).
And We had sent to nations from before you, so We took/punished them with the misery/hardship/fear and the calamity, maybe they become humble and humiliate themselves (to God).
So where it not for when Our might came to them, they became humble and humiliated themselves, and but their hearts/minds became cruel/merciless, and the devil decorated/beautified for them what they were making/doing.
So when they forgot what they were reminded with it, We opened on them every thing's doors/entrances, until when they became happy/delighted with what they were given, (then) We took/punished them suddenly, so then they are confused/dumbfounded.
So (it was) cut off/separated (the) root/remainder (of) the nation those who caused injustice/oppression, and the praise/gratitude (is) to God the creations altogether's/(universe's) Lord.
Say: "Did you see/understand, if God took your sense of hearing and your eye sights/understanding, and sealed/stamped on your hearts/minds , which god other than God comes to you with it?" See how We elaborate linguistically the signs/verses/evidences, then they turn away/avoid.
Say: "Did I show you, if God's torture came to you suddenly or publicly/loudly , does except the nation the unjust/oppressors be destroyed?"
And We do not sent the messengers except (as) announcers of good news and warners/givers of notice, so who believed and corrected/repaired, so no fear on them and nor they be sad/grievous.
And those who denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences, the torture touches them because of what they were debauching .
Say: "I do not say to you, at me (are) God's safes/storages (treasures), and I do not know the unseen/absent ,and I do not say to you that I am (an) angel/king/owner , that I follow except what (is) transmitted/revealed to me." Say: "Do the blind, and the seeing become equal/alike, so do you not think?"
And warn with it those who fear that they be gathered to their Lord, (there) is not for them a guardian , and nor a mediator other than Him, maybe they fear and obey.
And do not expel/drive away those who call their Lord with the early mornings and the evening ,they want His face/direction, their account is not on you from a thing, and your account is not on them from a thing, so you expel them/drive them away, so you be from the unjust/oppressive (P).
And like that We tested/allured some of them with some, to say (P): "Are those (who) God blessed on them from between us?" Is God not more knowing with the thankful/grateful?
And if those who believe came to you with Our verses/evidences, so say: "A greeting/peace on you, your Lord decreed on Himself the mercy, that who from you made/did bad/evil/harm with ignorance/foolishness, then he repented from after it, and corrected/repaired, so that He truly is a forgiver, merciful."
And like that We explain/clarify the verses/evidences , and to clarify/show/explain the criminal's/sinner's path/road.
Say: "That I, I was forbidden/prevented that I worship those who you call from other than God." Say: "I do not follow your self attractions for desires I had then become misguided, and I am not from the guided."
Say: "That I (am) on an evidence from my Lord, and you denied/falsified with it; at me is not what you hurry/urge with it, that the judgment/rule (is) except to God, He narrates/informs the truth , and He (is) best (of) the judges/separators ."
Say: "If that at me (is) what you hurry/urge with it, the matter/affair would have been executed/carried out between me and between you, and God (is) more knowing with the unjust/oppressors."
And at Him (are) the unseen's/absent's/super natural's keys/treasures, no (one) knows it except He, and He knows what (is) in the land/shore and the sea/ocean , and (nothing) from a leaf/piece of paper does not fall/drop except He knows it, and nor a seed/grain in the earth's darknesses and nor soft/ripe , and nor dry (hard) except (it is documented) in (an) evident Book .
And He is who makes you die at the night and He knows what you earned/committed at the daytime, then He resurrects/revives you in it to be executed/carried out an identified (specified) term/time, then to Him (is) your return, then He informs you with what you were making/doing . 
And He is the defeater/conqueror over His worshippers/slaves, and He sends on you caretakers/keepers/angels until if the death came (to) any of you, Our messengers made him die, and they do not neglect/waste .
Then they were returned to God their correct/real owner/master; is it not to Him the judgment/rule? And He is the counter's/calculator's faster (fastest).
Say: "Who saves/rescues you from (the) darknesses (of) the land/shore and the sea/ocean, you call Him humbly and humiliated and secretly: "If (E) He saved/rescued us from this we will become (E) from the thankful/grateful."
Say: "God saves/rescues you from it, and from every grief, hardship and suffering , then you are sharing/making partners (with God)."
Say: "He is the capable on that He sends on you a torture, from above you, or from beneath your feet, or He mixes/confuses you (into) groups/parties, and makes some of you taste/experience (the) courage/might (of) some, look/consider/perceive how We elaborate linguistically the verses/evidences, maybe they understand/learn."
And your nation denied/lied/falsified with it, and it is the truth . Say: "I am not with a protector/guardian on (for) you."
To each information/news (is a) settlement/affixation (time) and you will/shall know.
And if you saw those who plunge into/engage in conversation (interpreting beyond the actual Koranic text) in Our verses/evidences, so turn away from them until they plunge into/engage in conversation in an information/speech other than it, and if the devil makes you forget, so do not sit/remain after the remembrance/reminder with the nation, the unjust/oppressive.
And there is not from a thing on those who fear and obey (God) from their account/calculation (those who fear and obey God need not worry about their account), and but (it is) a remembrance/reminder, maybe they fear and obey.
And leave those who took their religion playing/amusement and a play thing/amusement, and the life the present/worldly life has deceived/tempted them, and remind them with it, that a self be exposed/made to surrender to destruction because (of) what it earned/acquired , (there) is not a guardian for it, and nor a mediator from other than God, and if it ransoms/redeems every ransom/redemption (it will) not be taken from it, those are those who were exposed/made to surrender to destruction because (of) what they earned/acquired , for them (is) a drink from hot water/sweat , and a painful torture because (or) what they were disbelieving.
Say: "Do we call from other than God what does not benefit us, and nor harms us, and we be returned on our heels, after when God guided us, as/like whom the devil tempted/allured him , in the earth/Planet Earth, confused/bewildered, for him (are) friends/company, they call him to the guidance: 'Come to us.'" Say: "That God's guidance, it is the guidance, and we were ordered/commanded to surrender to the creations altogether's/(universes') Lord."
And that keep up the prayers and fear and obey Him, and He is who to Him you are being gathered/collected.
And He is who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth , and a day He says: "Be." So it becomes, His saying/words (is) the truth, and to Him (is) the ownership ; a day the horn/bugle be blown into, (He is) knower (of) the unseen/absent , and the testimony/presence , and He is the wise/judicious, the expert/experienced.
And when Abraham said to his father, Azar: "Do you take idols (as) gods? That I see you, and your nation in evident misguidance."
And like that We show Abraham the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/might/power , and to be from the sure/certain.
So when the night darkened on him, he saw a star/planet, he said: "That (is) my lord." So when it set/darkened, he said: "I do not like the setting/disappearing."
So when he saw the moon, rising/emerging, he said: "That (is) my lord, so when it set/darkened, he said: "If (E) my lord does not guide me, I will be (E) from the nation the misguided."
So when he saw the sun rising/emerging, he said: "That (is) my lord, that (is) bigger." So when it set, he said: "You (my) nation, that I am innocent/renouncing from what you share/make partners (with God)."
That I aimed/turned my face/front to who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (as) a submitter/Unifier of God , and I am not from the sharers/makers of partners (with God).
And his nation disputed with him, he said: "Do you argue/dispute with me in God and He had guided me, and I do not fear what you share/make partners (with God) with it, except that my lord wills/wants a thing, my lord spread/enriched every thing (in) knowledge, so do you not think?"
And how (do) I fear what you shared/made partners (with God), and you (P) (do) not fear that you shared/made partners with God what He did not descend with it on you (from) a proof/evidence ? So which (of) the two groups/parties (is) more worthy with the safety/security if you were knowing?
Those who believed and did not confuse/mix/cover their faith/belief with injustice/oppression, (so) those are for them the safety/security, and they are guided.
And that (is) Our proof/argument, We gave/brought it (to) Abraham on (to) his nation, We raise steps/stages (of) whom We will/want, that your lord (is) wise/judicious, knowledgeable.
And We granted to him Issac, and Jacob, each/all We guided, and Noah We guided from before, and from his descendants (are) David, and Soliman, and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Aaron, and like that We reward the good doers.
And Zacharias/Zachary, and John, and Jesus, and Elias, all/each (is) from the correct/righteous.
And Ishmael, and Elija, and Jonah, and Lot, and each/all We preferred/favoured on the creations altogether/(universes).
And from their fathers/forefathers, and their descendants, and their brothers, and We chose/purified them and We guided them to a straight/direct road/way.
That (is) God's guidance, He guides with it whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves, and if they shared/made partners (with God), what they were making/doing/working would have been wasted/invalidated from them.
Those are, those whom We brought to (gave) them The Book and the judgment/rule and the prophethood, so if those disbelieve with it, so We had entrusted/empowered/appointed a keeper with it, a nation they are not with it disbelieving.
Those are, those who God guided, so with their guidance, I follow/imitate (their) example, so I do not ask/demand of you a reward/wage/fee, that truly it is except a remembrance/reminder to the creations altogether/(universes).
And they did not evaluate God His correct/just value/estimation, when they said: "God did not descend on (a) human from a thing." Say: "Who descended The Book which Moses came with it, (as) a light and guidance to the people? You make it papers/parchments, you show it and you hide much, and you were taught/instructed what you did not know, you and nor your fathers/forefathers." Say: "God." Then leave them in their plunging, they play/amuse/enjoy/joke/mock.
And that (is) a Book , We descended it blessed, confirming (with) what (is) between his hands, and to warn/give notice (E) (to the) mother/origin of villages (Bekka) and who (is) around/surrounding it, and those who believe with the end (other life), they believe with it, and they are on their prayers observing .
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on God lies/falsifications, or he said: "Was inspired/transmitted to me." And was not inspired/transmitted to him a thing, and who said: "I will descend equal/alike (to) what God descended". And if you see/understand when the unjust/oppressors (are) in the death's/lifelessness' intensities/intoxications, and the angels (are) spreading/extending their hands: "Get your selves out, today you are being rewarded/reimbursed the humiliation's/disgrace's torture because (of) what you were saying on (about) God other than the truth , and you were from His verses/evidences/signs being arrogant.
And you had come to Us singularly as We created you (the) first time , and you left what We gave you generously behind your backs, and We do not see with you your mediators, those who you claimed that they (are) in you partners (it) had been (E) separated between you, and (it was) wasted from you what you were claiming .
That God (is) splitter (of) the seed/grain and the kernel/nucleuses (and) He brings out the live/alive from the dead, and (He is) bringing out the dead from the live/alive, that one (is) God, so how (do) you lie/turn away.
Splitter (of) the morning/day break and He made the night tranquillity/security/residence and the sun and the moon counting/calculating, that (is) predestination (of) the glorious/mighty , the knowledgeable.
And He is who made/created for you the stars/planets to be guided with it in the shore's/land's and the sea's darknesses, We had detailed/explained the evidences/verses to a nation knowing.
And He is who created/formed you from one (F) self, so a settled/established and depository/storage place/womb , We had detailed/explained the evidences/verses to a nation understanding/knowing/learning.
And He is who descended from the sky water, so We brought out/made emerge with it every thing's plant, so We brought out/made emerge from it green, We bring out/make emerge from it seeds/grains overlapping ,and from the palm trees from its first fruit of the season/cover enveloping the fertilizing seed, near branches with bunches of dates , and treed gardens from grapes, and the olives, and the pomegranate, similar/resembling and not similar/resembling , look/consider to its fruit if/where/when it bears/yields fruit , and its ripeness/darkness, that in that (are) evidences/verses (E) to a nation believing.
And they made/created to God partners (from) the Jinns and He created them, and they lied (invented lies) for Him, sons and daughters, without knowledge , His praise/glory! And (He is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified from what they describe/categorize.
Creating marvelously without precedent (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, how (could it) be for Him a child, and (there) was not for Him a wife/companion/friend, and He created every thing, and He is with every thing knowledgeable?
That one (is) God, your (P) Lord, no God except Him, creator (of) every thing, so worship Him, and He is on every thing a guardian/protector .
The eye sights/knowledge do not comprehend/reach Him , and He comprehends/reaches the eye sights/knowledge, and He is the most kind/gracious , the expert/experienced.
Clear sightedness had come to you from your (P) Lord, so who saw/understood so to himself, and who blinded so on it, and I am not on you with a protector/observer .
And like that We elaborate linguistically the evidences/verses , and to say (P): "You studied/memorized/read." And to clarify/show/explain it to a nation knowing.
Follow what was inspired/transmitted to you, from your Lord, no God except Him, and object/turn away from the sharers/takers of partners (with God).
And if God wanted/willed, they would not (have) shared/made partners (with God), and We did not make you a protector/observer on them, and you are not on them with a guardian .
And do not insult/abuse/defame those who call from other than God, so they insult/abuse/defame God, transgression/violation without knowledge, like that We decorated/beautified to every nation/generation their work , then to their Lord (is) their return, so He informs them with what they were making/doing .
And they swore/made oath by God their oath's utmost if (E) an evidence/verse came to them they will believe (E) with it, say: "But the verses/evidences (are) at God." And what makes you feel/know, that if it came, they do not believe?
And We turn their hearts (minds) and their eye sights/understanding as they did not believe with it (the) first time , and We leave them in their tyranny/arrogance being confused/hesitant.
And if that We descended to them the angels, and the deads talked (to) them , and We gathered on them every thing in front, they were not to believe, except that God wants/wills, and but most of them are being ignorant .
And like that We made/put to each prophet an enemy (from) the human's/mankind's and the Jinn's devils, some of them inspire/transmit to some the word's/opinion and belief's ornament/decoration (as) deceit/temptation, and if your Lord wanted/willed they would not have done it, so leave them and what they fabricate
And to incline to it the hearts (minds of) those who do not believe with the end (other life), and to accept/approve it, and to commit/perpetrate what they are committing/perpetrating.
So is other than God I ask/desire (as) a judge/ruler, and He is who descended to you The Book detailed/explained ? And those who We brought (gave) to them The Book , they know that it (is) descended from your Lord with the truth , so do not be (E) from the doubting/arguing.
And your Lord's word/expression (was/is) completed truthfully and justly/equitably, (there is) no exchanger/replacer to His words/expressions, and He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
And if you obey (follow) most of who (is) in the earth, they misguide you from God's way/path , that they follow except the assumption/suspicion , and that they (are) except lying/speculating.
That your Lord, He is more knowing (about) who misguides from His way/path , and He is more knowing with the guided.
So eat from what God's name was mentioned on it, if you where with His verses/evidences believing.
And how (why) for you that you not eat from what God's name was mentioned on it, and He had detailed/explained for you what He forbade on you, except what you were forced to it, and that many misguide (E) with their self attractions for desires without knowledge, that your Lord, He is more knowing with (about) the transgressors .
And leave (the) apparent/visible (of) the sin/crime, and its hidden/secret , that those who acquire/carry the sin/crime, they will be rewarded/reimbursed with what they were fabricating.
And do not eat/consume from what God's name was not mentioned on it, and that it truly is debauchery (E) , and that the devils inspire/transmit (E) to their patrons/supporters to argue/dispute with you, and if you obeyed them, that you are (then) sharers/takers of partners (with God) (E).
Is who was/is dead/lifeless, so We revived him and We made/put for him a light he walks with it in (between) the people, as who his example (is) in the darknesses (and he) is not with getting out from it? Like that (it) was decorated/beautified to the disbelievers what they were making/doing .
And like that We made/put in every village/urban city its greatest/bigger criminals/sinners to cheat/deceive in it, and they do not cheat/deceive except with themselves, and they do not feel/know .
And if an evidence/verse came to them, they said: "We will never/not believe until we be given/brought similar/equal/alike (to) what was given/brought (to) God's messengers." God (is) more knowing where/when He makes/puts His message, those who committed a sin/crime will be struck/marked (with) humiliation/lowliness/subservience at God, and strong (severe) torture because (of) what they were cheating/deceiving.
So who God wants/wills that He guides him, He expands his chest to the Islam/submission (to God), and who He wants/wills that He misguides him, He makes his chest narrow/tight , a tightness/strain/sin , as if (he) ascends in the sky/space, like that God makes/puts the obscenity/punishment and torture on those who do not believe.
And that (is) your Lord's straight/direct road/way , We had detailed/explained the verses/evidences to a nation mentioning/remembering. 
For them the safety's/security's home at their Lord, and He is their guardian/victorior because (of) what they were doing .
And a day (when) He gathers them all together , you the Jinn's race , you had become more than the human , and their allies/patrons from the human said: "Our Lord, some of us enjoyed with some (of them) and we reached our term/time that You delayed for us." He said: "The fire (is) your residence , (you are) immortally in it except what (who) God wanted/willed, that your Lord (is) wise/judicious, knowledgeable."
And like that We appoint/enable some (of) the unjust/oppressors (over) some, because (of) what they (were) earning/gathering .
You the Jinn's and the human's race , did not messengers from you come to you, they relay/inform on you My verses/evidences and warn you (of) this your day's/time's meeting (your meeting at this day/time)? They said: "We witnessed/testified on our selves." And the life the present/worldly life had deceived/tempted them, and they witnessed/testified on themselves that they were disbelieving.
That (is) that your Lord was not destroying the villages/urban cities with injustice, and its people (are) ignoring/disregarding .
And for each steps/stages/degrees from what they made/did, and your Lord is not with ignoring/neglecting about what they make/do .
And your Lord (is) the rich (owner of) the mercy, if He wants/wills He wipes you off , and makes a successor from after you, what He wills/wants, as He created you from another nation's descendants.
That what you are being promised is coming (E), and you are not with disabling/frustrating (it).
Say: "You (my) nation, do/work at your capacity that I am doing/working, so you will know who (is to) be for him the home's end/turn (result), that He does not make the unjust/oppressors succeed/win.
And they made/created to God from what He created/seeded from the agricultural land/plants and the camels/livestock a share , so they said: "That (is) to God." with their claims/pretensions , "And that (is) to our partners (with God)." So what (was) to their partners (with God) so it does not reach to God, and what was to God, so it reaches to their partners (with God), it was bad/evil what they judge/rule.
And like that their partners (with God) decorated/beautified to many of the takers of partners (with God) killing/murdering their children, to make them be destroyed/perished , and to confuse/mix on them their religion, and if God willed/wanted they would not have done it, so leave them, and what they are fabricating .
And they said: "Those camels/livestock, and cultivation/plantation (are) prohibited, no (one) eats it except whom we will/want." With their claims/pretensions , and camels/livestock its backs were forbidden ,and camels/livestock they do not mention/remember God's name on it, fabrication on Him, He will reward/reimburse them because (of) what they were fabricating.
And they said: "What (is) in these camels'/livestock's' bellies/insides (are) clearly/purely to our males and forbidden on our wives/spouses." And if (it) was dead , so they are in it partners, he will reward/reimburse them (equal to) their description/categorization, that He (is) wise/judicious, knowledgeable.
Those who killed their children ignorantly/foolishly without knowledge, had lost/misguided and perished, and they forbade/prohibited what God provided for them, fabrication on God, they had misguided, and they were not guided.
And He is who created trellised treed gardens/paradises and not trellised, and the palm trees, and the plants its food/fruits (are) different, and the olives, and the pomegranate, similar and not similar , eat from its fruit if it bore its fruit, and give its share (on the) day/time (of) its harvest/gathering, and do not spoil/waste , that He does not love/like the spoilers/wasters .
And from the camels/livestock carriers/burdeners , and spreaders , eat from what God provided for you, and do not follow the devil's foot steps, that he (is) for you a clear/evident enemy.
Eight pairs , from the sheep two, and from the goats two, say: "Are the two males forbidden or the two females, but (or what) in the two females' wombs/uteruses contained/included on (in) it? Inform me with knowledge if you were truthful."
And from the camels two, and from the cows two, say: "Are the two males forbidden or the two females, but (or what) the two females' wombs/uteruses contained/included on (in) it? Or where you witnesses/testifiers if God directed/commanded you with that? So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on (about) God lies/falsifications to misguide the people without knowledge?" That God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive.
Say: "I do not find in what (was) inspired/transmitted to me forbidden on an eater/taster (that) he eats/tastes it, except that (it) be dead (animal) or poured/shed blood, or a pig's/swine's flesh/meat, so it truly is filth (an) atrocious act or debauchery was declared/praised the name of whom the sacrifice was made for to other than God with it, so who was forced, not transgressing/corrupting and nor transgressing/violating , so then your Lord (is) forgiving, merciful."
And on those who repented/guided/(the Jews), We forbade every (thing) of nails/claws , and from the cows and the sheep and goats , We forbade on them their (B)'s fat/grease, except what their (B)'s backs bore , or the intestines/guts , or what (was) mixed/mingled with bones, that We rewarded/reimbursed them because of their oppression/transgression, and We are truthful (E).
So if they denied you , so say: "Your Lord (is owner) of abundant mercy, and His might/power is not to be returned from the nation the criminals/sinners .
Those who shared/made partners (with God) will say: "If God wanted/willed, we would not (have) made partners (with God), and nor our fathers, and nor forbade from a thing." Like that those from before them lied/denied until they tasted/experienced Our might/power , say: "Is at you from knowledge, so you bring it out for us? That you follow except the assumption/suspicion, and that truly you are except lying/speculating."
Say: "To God (is) the eloquent, the proof/argument, so if He wanted/willed, He would have guided you all/altogether ."
Say: "Come/bring your witnesses/testifiers, those who witness/testify that God forbade this." So if they witnessed/testified, so do not witness/testify with them and do not follow (the) self attractions for desires (of) those who denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences , and those who do not believe with the end (other life), and they are with their Lord are making equals."
Say: "Come I (will) read/recite what your Lord forbade on you, that do not make partners with Him (in) a thing, and with the parents (treat with) goodness, and do not kill your children from poverty We provide for you and them, and do not approach/near the enormous/atrocious deeds , what is visible from it, and what is hidden, and do not kill the self that God forbade, except with the right , that He directed/commanded you with it, maybe you reason/comprehend ."
And do not approach/near the orphan's property/possession except with which it is best, until he reaches his maturity/strength, and fulfill/complete the measuring/weighing device, and the scale with the just/equitable, We do not burden a self except its endurance/capacity, and if you said (talked), so be just/equitable, and even if (it) was (against) of the relations/near, and with God's promise/contract fulfill/complete; that He directed/commanded with it, maybe you mention/remember .
And that, that (is) My straight/direct road/path, so follow it, and do not follow the roads/paths, so it separates (divides) with you from His road/path, that He directed/commanded you with it, maybe you fear and obey (God).
Then We brought/gave Moses The Book complete on that (what is) best detailing/explaining to every thing, and guidance, and mercy, maybe they believe with their Lord's meeting.
And this Book , We descended it blessed, so follow it, and fear and obey (God), maybe you attain mercy.
That you say: "But The Book was descended on two groups from before us, and that we were about their studies/readings ignoring/disregarding (E) ."
Or you say: "If (only) that The Book was descended on us, we would have been more guided than them." So an evidence had come to you from your Lord, and guidance, and mercy, so who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who denied/falsified with God's verses/evidences and discouraged/turned away from it? We will reward/reimburse those who discourage/turn away from Our verses/evidences the torture's evil/harm ,because (of) what they were discouraging/turning away.
Do they wait except that the angels come to them , or your Lord comes, or some (of) your Lord's verses/evidences come? (On) a day/time some (of) your Lord's verses/evidences come, a self's belief does not benefit (it) if it was (had) not believed from before, or gained goodness in its belief, say: "Wait/watch , We are waiting/watching."
That those who separated (divided) their religion, and were groups/parties , you are not from them in a thing, but their matter/affair (is) to God, then He informs them with what they were making/doing.
Who came/did with the goodness, so to him ten similars/equals to it, and who came/did with the sin/crime, so he will not be rewarded/reimbursed except similar/equal to it, and they are not being caused injustice/oppression to.
Say: "That I (E), my Lord (had) guided me to (a) straight/direct road/way (a) straight/valuable  religion, Abraham's religion/faith, Unifier of God , and he was not from the sharers/takers of partners (with God)."
Say: "That my prayers and my rituals or methods of worship , and my life, and my death/time of death, (is) to the creations altogether's/(universes') Lord."
No partner to Him, and with that I was ordered/commanded, and I am first (of) the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers .
Say: "Is other than God I desire (as) a Lord, and He is Lord (of) every thing, and every self does not earn/gather except on it, and no sinner/burdener carries/bears (the) load/weight (of) another, then to your Lord (is) your return, so He informs you with what you were in it differing/disagreeing ."
And He is who made/created you the earth's/Planet Earth's successors and replacers/leaders , and He rose some of you above/over some (by) steps/stages/degrees, to test you in what He gave you, that your Lord (is) quick (in) the punishment, and that He (is) forgiving (E), merciful. 
A L M S/C .
A Book was descended to you so no tightness/strain be in your chest (innermost) from it, to warn/give notice with it and a remembrance/reminder to the believers.
Follow what was descended to you from your Lord, and do not follow from other than Him guardians ,little (is) what you remember/glorify .
And how many from a village/urban city We destroyed it , so Our might/power came to it suddenly at night/overnight, or (while) they are saying/relaxing at midday .
So their call/prayer when/if Our might/power came to them was not except that they said: "We were unjust/oppressive ."
So We will ask/question (E) those sent to them, and We will ask/question (E) the messengers.
So We will inform/narrate on (to) them with knowledge and We were not absent.
And the weight/measure that day (is) the correct/deserved/just , so who his (whose) weights/measures became heavy, so those, they are the successful/winners.
And who his (whose) weights/measures were reduced/lightened, so those (are) those who lost themselves because (of) what they were with Our signs/verses/evidences causing injustice/oppression.
And We had strengthened/empowered you in the earth/Planet Earth, and We made for you in it livelihood/sustenance, little (is) what you thank/be grateful .
And We had created you, then We pictured/formed you , then We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam." So they prostrated except Satan , was not from the prostrating.
He (God) said: "What prevented/stopped/forbid you, that you not prostrate when/if I ordered/commanded you?" He (the devil)said: "I am better than him, You created me from fire, and You created him from mud/clay ."
He (God) said: "So drop/reduce/decline from it, so (it) was not to be for you that you be arrogant in it, so get out/emerge , that you are from the subservient/humiliated/lowly ."
He (the devil) said: "Give me time/delay me to a day they be sent/resurrected/revived."
He (God) said: "That you are from the given time/delayed ."
He (the devil) said: "So with what you misguided/enticed me , I will sit/remain (E) for them (in) Your straight/direct road/way."
Then I will come to them from between their hands, and from behind them, and from/of/on their rights, and from/of/on their lefts, and You (will) not find most of them thankful/grateful.
He (God) said: "Get out/emerge from it expelled/degraded , expelled/driven away , whom (E) followed you from them, I will fill (E) Hell from you all/all together (E)."
And you Adam, reside/inhabit you and your wife/spouse the Paradise, so you (B) eat from (it) where/when you (B) willed/wanted, and do not approach/near this/that the tree, so you (B) become/will be from the unjust/oppressive.
So the devil talked to/gave evil suggestions and temptations to them (B) to show to them (B) what was hidden/concealed from them (B) from their (B)'s shameful genital private parts, and he said: "Your (B)'s Lord did not prevent you (B) from that/this tree except that you (B) become/be two angels or you (B) become/be from the immortal/eternal ."
And he swore/made oath to them (B): "I am to you (B) from (E) the advisors/counselors."
So he lured/attracted and lowered them (B) , with deceit/temptation so when they (B) tasted/experienced the tree, their (B)'s shameful genital private parts appeared to them (B), and they (B) started and continued (to) stick/tried hard to make do with what they do not have on them (B) from the Paradise's leaves , and their (B)'s Lord called them (B): "Did I not forbid/prevent you (B) from that the tree, and I said to you (B) that the devil (is) for you (B) an evident enemy?"
They (B) said: "Our Lord, We caused injustice/oppressed ourselves, and if You do not forgive for us, and You have mercy upon us, we will be/become from the losers ."
He said: "Drop/descend/reduce some of you to some (are) an enemy, and for you in the earth/Planet Earth (is) settlement/establishment and long life/enjoyment to a time ."
He said: "In it you live, and in it you die, and from it you are brought out ."
You Adam's sons and daughters, We had descended on you a cover/dress (that) hides/conceals your shameful genital private parts, and feathers/riches/possessions, and the fear and obedience (of God's) cover/dress, that (is) better , and that (is) from God's signs/verses/evidences, maybe/perhaps they remember/glorify .
You Adam's sons and daughters, (let) not the devil test/misguide/betray you as/like he brought out your parents from the Paradise, he removes/pulls away from them (B) their (B)'s cover/dress to show them (B)/make them (B) understand their (B)'s shameful genital private parts; that he sees you, he and his group/tribe from where/when you do not see them, that We made the devils guardians/allies to those who do not believe.
And if they made/did an enormous/atrocious deed , they said: "We found our fathers on it, and God ordered/commanded us with it." Say: "That God does not order/command with the enormous/atrocious deeds , do you say on (about) God what you do not know?"
Say: "My Lord ordered/commanded with the just/equitable, and stand your faces/fronts at every mosque/place of worshipping God, and call Him faithful/loyal to Him (in) the religion, as/like He started/created you , you return.
A group/party , He guided, and a group/party (it) became fact/deserved/imminent on them the misguidance, that they took the devils (as) guardians/allies from other than God, and they think/suppose that they are guided. 
You Adam's sons and daughters, take/receive your decoration/beauty at every/each mosque/place of worshipping God, and eat and drink and do not waste/spoil/ignore , that God does not love/like the wasters .
Say: "Who forbid God's decoration/beauty/ornament which He brought out to (for) His worshippers/slaves, and the enjoyable/goodnesses from the provision/things of benefit or value ?"Say: "It is to those who believed in the life the present/worldly life clearly/purely (in) the Resurrection Day, as/like that We detail/explain/clarify the verses/evidences to a nation knowing."
Say: "But my Lord forbade the enormous/atrocious deeds what is/became visible from it, and what is/was hidden, and the sin/crime, and the oppression/transgression/corruption without the right , and that you share/make partners (with God) what He did not descend with it a proof/evidence , and that you say on (about) God what you do not know.
And to every nation (is) a term/time, so if their term/time came, they do not delay/lag behind an hour, and they do not advance .
You Adam's sons and daughters, if/whenever messengers from you come to you, they narrate/relay/inform on (to) you My verses/evidences , so who feared and obeyed and corrected/repaired , so no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving.
And those who lied/denied/falsified, with Our verses/evidences and they became arrogant from it, those are the fire's owners/company/friends, they are in it immortally/eternally .
So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on (about) God lies/denials/falsifications or lied/denied/falsified with His verses/evidences , those their share/fortune from The Book takes them until/if/when Our messengers came to them, they make them die, they said: "Where (is) what you were/are calling/wishing/desiring from other than God?" They said: "They were misguided from us, and they witnessed/testified on themselves that they truly, they were disbelieving/disbelievers."
He said: "Enter in (with) nations (that) have past/expired from before you from the Jinns and the human/mankind in the fire, whenever a nation is entered, it cursed its sister until they caught up (to)/overtook/reached each other in it all together, their last said to their first : "Our Lord those (are who) misguided us, so give/bring them a double torture from the fire." He said: "For every/each/all (is) double, and but you do not know."
And their first said to their last: "So (there) was/is not was for you on us from grace/favour/blessing, so taste/experience the torture because (of) what you were gaining/acquiring ."
That those who lied/denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences and became arrogant from/about it, the sky's/space's doors/entrances do not be (get) opened for them, and nor they enter the Paradise, until the camel enters/penetrates in the needle's/sewing needle's eye/threading hole, and as/like that We reward/reimburse the criminals/sinners.
For them from Hell (is a) bed/crib , and from above them covers/darknesses , and as/like that We reward/reimburse the unjust/oppressors. 
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, We do not burden/impose a self except its endurance/capacity , those are the Paradises' owners/company , they are in it immortally/eternally.
And We removed/took away what (is) in their chests (innermosts) from hatred/spite/animosity , the rivers flow from beneath them , and they said: "The praise/gratitude/thanks (is) to God who guided us to this, and we were not to (be) guided had it not been for that God guided us. Our Lord's messengers had come with the truth ." And they (those who believed) were called: "That (is) the Paradise you were made to inherit it becuase (of) what you were making/doing/working."
And the Paradises' owners/company called/cried (to) the fire's owners/company: "That we had found what our Lord promised us truthful/factually , so did you find what your Lord promised truthfully/factually ?" They said: "Yes." So an announcer/informer (from) between them announced/informed : "That God's curse/torture (is) on the unjust/oppressors ."
Those who prevent/obstruct from God's way/path and they desire it (be) bent/crookedness , and they are with the end (other life) disbelieving.
And between them (B) (is) a partition/barrier/protection , and on the fence between Heaven and Hell/the highest tip of anything (are) men they know each/all with (by) their marks/identifications/expressions, and they called/cried (to) the Paradises' company/friends : "That a greeting/security/peace on you." They did not enter it and they are coveting/desiring .
And if their eye sights/understanding was diverted towards the fire's company/friends , they said: "Our Lord do not make/put us with the nation the unjust/oppressive ."
And company/friends (of) the fence between Heaven and Hell/the highest tip of anything called/cried (to) men (that) they know them by their marks/identifications/expressions. They said: "Your gatherings/collecting/group and what you were being arrogant did not enrich/satisfy from you."
Are those, those who you swore/made oath (that) God will not take/receive them with a mercy? Enter the Paradise, no fear/fright on you and nor you be sad/grieving.
And the fire's company/friends called/cried (to) the Paradises' company/friends : "That spread/flow on us from the water or from what God provided for you." They said: "That God forbade/prohibited them (B) on the disbelievers."
Those who took their religion (as) an amusement/fun and playing/mockery and the life the present/worldly life has deceived/tempted them, so the day/today We forget them as/like they forgot this their day/time, and as long as (because of) what they were with Our verses/evidences disbelieving and denying .
And We had come to them with a Book (that) We detailed/explained it on knowledge ,guidance and mercy to a nation believing.
Do they wait/watch except (for) its interpretation/explanation? (On) a day its interpretation/explanation comes, those who forgot it from before say: "Our Lord's messengers had come with the truth . So are (there) for us from mediators, so they mediate for us, or we be returned so we make/do other than what we were making/doing?" They had lost themselves, and what they were fabricating/cutting and splitting (was) misguided/wasted/lost from them.
That your Lord (is) God who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth in six days/times, then He aimed to/sat on/straightened on the throne/royal bed/palace , the daytime covers/darkens the night, it seeks/wants it quickly/urgently , and the sun and the moon and the stars/planets (are) manipulated/subjugated with His order/command, is (it) not to Him the creation and the order/command/matter/affair? Blessed (is) God the creatures all together's/(universes') Lord.
Call your Lord humbly and humiliated and hiddenly/secretly, that He does not love/like the transgressors/violators .
And do not corrupt/disorder in the earth/Planet Earth after its correction/repairment, and call Him fearfully/frightfully wishing/coveting , that God's mercy (is) near/close from the good doers.
And He is who sends the winds/breezes a good news between His mercy's hand, until when it carried/raised heavy loaded clouds, We drove it to a dead country/land , So We descended with it the water, so We brought out with it from every the fruits, as/like that We bring out/make (to) emerge the deads, maybe/perhaps you mention/remember/glorify .
And the good/pure country/land its plants appear/emerge with its Lord's permission , and which became (was) bad/spoiled , does not appear/emerge except very little/useless/weak, as/like that We elaborate linguistically (explain in detail) the verses/evidences to a nation thinking/being grateful.
We had sent Noah to his nation, so he said: "My nation worship God, (there) is not a God for you from other than Him, that I, I fear on (for) you a great day's torture."
The nobles/assembly from his nation said: "We , we are seeing you (E) in evident misguidance."
He said: "My nation, (there) is not misguidance with me, and but I am a messenger from the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
I communicate/deliver to you my Lord's messages, and I advise to you, and I know from God what you do not now.
Are you astonished/surprised that a reminder came to you from your Lord on a man from you to warn/give you notice, and to fear and obey (E), and maybe/perhaps you attain mercy.
So they denied Him , so We saved/rescued him and those with him in the ship , and We drowned/sunk those who denied with Our verses/evidences , that they truly were a blind/confused/misguided nation.
And to Aad/an ancient tribe that could have been Hegaz, (We sent) their brother Hood, he said: "My nation worship God, (there is) no God for you from other than Him, so do you not fear and obey?"
The nobles/assembly , those who disbelieved from his nation said: "That We , we (are) seeing/understanding you (E) in ignorance/stupidity , and (that) we suspect you (E) are from the disbelievers."
He said: "My nation (there) is no ignorance/stupidity with me, and but I (am) a messenger from the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
I communicate/inform you (with) my Lord's messages, and I am for you (a) faithful/loyal advisor/counselor.
Are you astonished/surprised , that a reminder came to you from your Lord on a man from you to warn/give you notice, and remember when He made/put you (as) successors and replacers/top leaders from after Noah's nation, and He increased you in the creation's expansion/abundance/wealth , so remember God's blessings, maybe/ perhaps you succeed/win.
They said: Did you come to us to worship God alone, and we leave (discard) what our fathers were worship(ping), so come/bring to us with what you promise us, if you were from the truthful.
He said: "Punishment and torture and anger from your Lord had fallen/landed on you, do you argue/dispute with me in (about) names you named it, you and your fathers, (that) God did not descend with it from a proof/evidence ? So wait/watch , that I am with you from the waiting/expecting/watching.
So We saved/rescued him and those with him with a mercy from Us, and We cut off/severed (the) root/remainder (of) those who disbelieved with Our verses/evidences , and they were not believers/believing.
And to Thamud/a pre-Islamic Arab tribe that could have been in Hegaz, (We sent) their brother Saleh, he said: "My nation, worship God, (there) is no God for you from other than Him, an evidence had come to you from your Lord, this (is) God's female camel for you (as) a sign/evidence , so leave it eat in God's ground/earth/land, and do not touch it with evil/harm , so (then a) painful torture takes/punishes you."
And remember when He made/put you (as) successors and replacers/top leaders from after Aad/an ancient tribe that could have been in Hegaz, and He settled/established you in the earth/Planet Earth, you take from its plains/flat and level lands castles/palaces/mansions and you carve out/hew the mountains (into) houses/homes, so remember God's blessings, and do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth corrupting/disordering .
The nobles/assembly , those who became arrogant from his nation said to those who were weakened to who believed from them: "Do you know that Saleh is sent from his Lord?" They Said: "We are with what (he) is sent with believing."
Those who became arrogant said: "We are with what you believed with it disbelieving."
So they wounded/slaughtered/made the female camel infertile and they became arrogant/disobedient from their Lord's order/command, and they said: "You Saleh, come/bring to us with what you promise us if you are from the messengers."
So the tremble and shake/quake punished/took them, so they became/became in the morning in their home/country/place stuck to the ground (dead).
So he turned away from them and he said: "My nation, I had communicated/informed (to) you my Lord's message, and I advised to you, and but you do not love/like the advisors/counselors."
And Lot when he said to his nation: "Do you commit the enormous/atrocious deed , (that) not from one/anyone from the creations all together/(universes) did not precede you with it?"
That you are coming/doing the men (with) lust/desire/craving from other than the women, but you are a nation (of) spoilers/wasters/extravagators."
And His nation's answer/replay was not except that they said: "Bring/drive them out from your village/urban city, that they truly are people purifying ."
So We saved/rescued him and his family/people except his woman (wife) was from the remaining behind."
And We rained on them rain, so see/wonder about how was the criminals'/sinners' end/turn (result).
And to Madya/an ancient city, that could have been by the Red Sea, (We sent) their brother Shu'aib, he said: "My nation, worship God, (there is) no God for you from other than Him, an evidence had come to you from your Lord, so fulfill/complete the measuring/weighing device, and the scale/measuring instrument , and do not reduce/cheat the people (from) their things, and do not corrupt/disorder in the earth/Planet Earth, (from) after its correction/repairment, that (is) better for you, if you were believing."
And do not sit/remain with every road/way, you promise and you object/prevent/obstruct who believed with it from God's way/road and you wish/desire it (be) bent/crookedness/indirectness, and remember when/where you where little/few , so He increased you, and see/wonder about how was the corruptings'/disorderings' end/turn (result).
And if (there) was a group of people from you (that) believed with what I was sent with it and a group of people did not believe, so be patient until God judges/rules between us, and He is the judges'/rulers' best .
The nobles/assembly, those who became arrogant from his nation said: "We will bring/drive you out (E) you Shu'aib and those who believed with you from our village/urban city or you return (E) in our religion/faith." He said: "Or even if we were hating (it)?"
We had fabricated on God lies/falsification , if we returned in your religion/faith after when God saved/rescued us from it, and (it) is not to be for us that we return in it except if that God, our Lord, wills/wants, our Lord extended/spread (over) every thing (in) knowledge, on God We relied/surrendered to ; our Lord judge between us and between our nation with the truth , and you are the victoriors'/defeators'/judges' best .
And the nobles/assembly, those who disbelieved from his nation said: "If (E) you followed Shu'aib, that you are then losers (E) ."
So the tremble/shake/quake punished/took them so they became/became in the morning in their home/country/place stuck to the ground (dead).
Those who denied Shu'aib were as if/as though they did not inhabit it/enrich/avail in it, those who denied Shu'aib were, they were the losers .
So he turned away from them, and he said: "My nation, I had communicated/informed you my Lord's messages, and I advised to you, so how (do) I grieve/sorrow for on a nation disbelieving?"
And We did not sent in a village/urban city from a prophet except We took its people with the misery/hardships , and the calamity/disastrous distress, maybe/perhaps they become humble and humiliate themselves .
Then We exchanged/substituted (in) place/position (of) the sin/crime the good/goodness, until they cure/forgave/pardoned, and they said: "The calamity/disastrous distress and the prosperity had touched our fathers." So We took/punished them suddenly/unexpectedly, and (while) they are not feeling/knowing/sensing.
And if that the villages'/urban cities' peoples believed and feared and obeyed, We would have opened/eased on them blessings from the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and but they denied/falsified , so We took/punished them because (of)what they were acquiring/gathering .
Did the villages'/urban cities' people trust that Our might/power comes to them overnight and (while) they are sleeping/slumbering ?
Or did the villages'/urban cities' people trust that Our might/power comes to them at sunrise/daybreak/forenoon and (while) they are playing/amusing ?
Did they secure God's scheme/deceit ? So no(one) trusts God's scheme/deceit except the nation the losers .
Or did He not guide to those inheriting the earth/Planet Earth from after its people , that if We will/want, We struck/marked them because of their crimes, and We stamp/cover/seal on their hearts/minds , so they do not hear/listen?
Those are the villages'/urban cities', We narrate/inform on (to) you from its information/news, and their messengers had come to them with the evidences, so they were not to believe with what they denied/falsified from before, as/like that God stamps/covers/seals on the disbelievers' hearts/minds .
And We did not find to most of them from a promise/contract , and that truly We found most of them debauchers (E) .
Then We sent from after them Moses with Our verses/evidences , to Pharaoh, and his nobles/assembly, so they caused injustice/oppression with it, so see/wonder about how was the corruptings'/disrepairings' end/turn (result).
And Moses said: "You Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
Truthful (careful/faithful) on (that) I do not say on (about) God except the truth , I had come to you with an evidence from your Lord, so send with me Israel's sons and daughters.
He said: "If you were came (you had come) with an evidence/sign , so come with it, if you were from the truthful."
So he threw away/threw his stick/cane, so then it is (an) evident/clear snake.
And he removed/pulled his hand, so then it is white to the lookers/watchers . (DOES THIS MEAN THAT MOSES WAS A BLACK MAN?)
The nobles/assembly from Pharaoh's nation said: "That truly that (is a) knowledgeable magician/sorcerer (E)."
He wants that he brings you out from your land , so what (do) you order/command?
They said: "Delay/postpone him and his brother and send in the cities/towns gatherers."
They come to you with every knowledgeable magician/sorcerer.
And the magicians/sorcerers came (to) Pharaoh, and they said: "That truly for us (is) a reward/fee (E) if we, we were the defeators ."
He said: "Yes, and that you are from (E) the neared/closer."
They said: "You Moses, either that you throw/throw away, or we, we be the throwing/throwing away."
He said: "Throw/throw away." So when they threw/threw away, they bewitched/enchanted the people's eyes/sights and they terrorized/terrified them, and they came with great magic/sorcery. (IF GOD REFEREED TO THE MAGIC AS "GREAT" THEN IT MUST REALLY HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY BY ANY STANDARD)
And We inspired/transmitted/signaled to Moses, that throw/throw away your stick/cane, so then it snatches/swallows quickly what they lie/falsify.
So the truth fell/happened , and what they were making/doing (was) wasted/canceled .
So they were defeated/overcome at that place and time, and they turned (became) submissive/subservient .
And the magicians/sorcerers were thrown/thrown away prostrating.
They said: "We believed with the creations all together's/(universes') Lord ."
Moses' and Aaron's Lord .
Pharaoh said: "You believed with Him, before that I permit for you? That, that (is) cheatery/deceit (E) you schemed/cheated/deceived it in the city/town to bring out from it its people , so you will/shall know."
I will cut off/amputate (E) your hands and your feet from opposites , then I will crucify you/place you on crosses all/all together. ("OPPOSITES" MEANS A RIGHT HAND AND A LEFT FOOT, OR A LEFT HAND AND A RIGHT FOOT)
They said: "We are to our Lord returning ."
And you do not revenge/hate/criticize from us except that we believed with our Lord's evidences/verses/signs, when (it) came to us, our Lord pour on us patience, and make us die (as) Moslems/submitters/surrenderers.
And the nobles/assembly from Pharaoh's nation said: "Do you leave Moses and his nation to corrupt/disorder in the earth/Planet Earth, and he leaves you and your gods?" He said: "We will kill their sons and shame/keep alive their women, and we are above/over them defeating/conquering."
Moses said to his nation: "Seek help/support/assistance by (from) God, and be patient, that the earth/land/Planet Earth (is) to God, He makes whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves inherit it, and the end (result is) to the fearing and obeying (God)."
They said: "We were mildly harmed from before that you came to us, and from after what you came to us." He said: "Maybe/perhaps (hopefully) your Lord, that He destroys/perishes your enemy and He makes you successors in the earth/Planet Earth/land, so He sees/watches how you do/work ."
And We had taken Pharaoh's family with the years (drought), and reduction (deficiency) from the fruits, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember .
So if the good/goodness came to them, they said: "This (is) for us." And if a sin/crime hits/strikes them , they get (have) a bad omen with Moses and whom (is) with him. Is it not, but their bad omen (is) at God, and but most of them do not know.
And they said: "whatever you come/bring to us with it, from an evidence/sign/verse to bewitch/enchant us with it, so we are not to you with believing."
So We sent on them the deadly/great flood/excess , and the grasshoppers/locusts and the lice, and the frogs and the blood, explained/clarified evidences/signs for them, so they became arrogant, and they were a nation (of) criminals/sinners .
And when the filth/torture fell on them, they said: "You Moses, call for us your Lord, with what He promised/pledged at you, if (E) you removed/uncovered (relieved) the filth/torture from us, we will believe (E) to you, and we will send (E) with you Israel's sons and daughters."
So when We removed/uncovered (relieved) from them the filth/torture to a term/time they, they are reaching it, then they are breaching/violating .
So We revenged/punished from them, so We drowned/sunk them in the body of water (river/sea/lake) because they denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences , and they were from it ignoring/disregarding .
And We made the nation, those who were being weakened inherit the earth's/Planet Earth's sun rises/easts, and its sunsets , that We blessed in it, and your Lord's word/expression the good (is) completed on Israel's sons and daughters because (of) what they were patient, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his nation were making/producing , and what they were building of trellised or wooden buildings/raising/supporting/inhabiting .
And We made with Israel's sons and daughters cross/pass through the large body of water (sea/ocean) , so they came/passed by on a nation occupying themselves/adhering on (to) idolized or worshipped idols/statues for them, they said: "You Moses, make/create for us a god, as/like (there are) gods for them." He said: "That you are a nation being lowly/ignorant/foolish ."
That those what they are in it (is) destroyed/ruined/broken, and what they were making/doing is being wasted/annulled .
He said: "Is other than God a god I wish/desire (for) you, and He preferred/favoured you over the creations all together/(universes)?"
And if We saved/rescued you from Pharaoh's family, they humiliate/impose upon you the punishment's evil/harm , they kill your sons and they shame/keep alive your women, and in that (is) a great test from your Lord.
And We promised Moses thirty nights, and We completed it with ten, so his Lord's appointed time/appointed time or place completed forty nights, and Moses said to his brother Aaron, "Be my successor in my nation, and correct/repair/reconciliate and do not follow the corrupting's way/path ."
And when Moses came to Our appointed time/appointed time or place, and his Lord conversed/spoke (to) him, he said: "My Lord show me/make me understand, I look/see to you." He said: "You will never/not see me, and but/however look to the mountain , so if it settled/established/affixed (in) its place/position, so you will/shall see me." So when his Lord uncovered/revealed/shined to the mountain, He made it crushed/destroyed/leveled/flattened, and Moses fell down fainting from thunderous noise/thunderstruck, so when he recovered/woke up, he said: "Your praise/glory, I repented to you, and I am first (of) the believers."
He said: "You Moses, that I, I chose/purified you, over the people with My messages, and with My speech/conversation/languages, so take/receive what I gave/brought you, and be from the thankful/grateful."
And We wrote/decreed for him in the tablets/sheets from every thing a sermon/advice/warning and detailing/explaining to every thing, so take/receive it with power/strength and order/command your nation (to) take/receive with its best, I will show you/make you understand the debauchers' home/house .
I will send away/divert/misguide from My verses/evidences those who are being arrogant in the earth/Planet Earth, without the right , and if they see/understand every verse/evidence, they do not believe with it, and if they see/understand the correct/right guidance way/path , they do not take it (as) a way/path, and if they see/understand the misguidance's/failure's way/path they take/receive it (as) a way/path, that (is) because they (E), they lied/denied (rejected) with Our evidences/verses, and they were from it ignoring/neglecting/disregarding.
And those who denied with Our verses/evidences, and the end's (other life's) meeting, their deeds (were) wasted; are they being rewarded/reimbursed except (for) what they were making/doing?
And Moses' nation took/received from after him from their jewel/ornament/decoration a calf's body, for him (a) moo/bellow; do they not see/understand that it does not converse/speak/talk (to) them, and nor guide them a way/road/path ? They took/received it, and they were unjust/oppressive.
And when it was wronged/confused/regretted in their hands, and they saw/understood that they had been misguided, they said: "If (E) our Lord does not have mercy upon us, and forgive for us we will be/become (E) from the losers ."
And when Moses returned to his nation angry sorrowfully/angrily, he said: "How bad you succeeded/followed me from after me, did you hurry/hasten/rush your Lord's order/command?" And he threw the tablets/sheets , and he took with his brother's head/top pulling/dragging him to him, he said: "Son (of my) mother, that the nation weakened me, and they were about to/almost (to) kill me, so do not make the enemies rejoice at my misfortune, and do not make me with the nation the unjust/oppressive."
He said: "My Lord, forgive for me and to my brother and enter us in Your mercy, and You are most merciful (of) the merciful."
That those who took/received the calf, anger from their Lord will take/receive/obtain them, and humiliation/disgrace in the life the present/worldly life, and like that We reward/reimburse the fabricators .
And those who made/did the sins/crimes, then they repented from after it, and they believed, that your Lord (is) from after it forgiving (E), merciful.
And when the anger quietened from Moses, he took/received the tablets/sheets , and in its transcription/duplicate/print (is) guidance and mercy to those who to their Lord they are awed/terrified/monastic/monkish.
And Moses chose (from) his nation seventy men, to Our appointed time/appointed time or place, so when the tremble and shake/quake/agitation took/punished them, he said: "My Lord, if you willed/wanted you made them die/destroyed them from before and (as well as) me, do you make us die/destroy us because (of) what the ignorant/foolish from us make/did? That it is except Your test , You misguide with it whom You will/want, and You guide whom You will/want, You are our guardian/patron , so forgive for us, and have mercy upon us, and You are best (of) the forgiving."
And decree for us in this the present world goodness and in the end (other life), we have, we repented/guided to You. He said: "My torture, I strike/mark who I will/want with it, and My mercy extended/enriches every thing, so I will decree to those who fear and obey, and give/bring the charity/purification and those who, they are with Our verses/evidences believing."
Those who follow the messenger, the prophet the illiterate/belonging to a nation, whom they find him written at them in the Torah/Old Testament, and the New Testament/Bible , He orders them with the kindness/goodness , and forbids/prevents them from the obscenity , and He permits/allows for them the pure/allowed/permitted , and forbids/prohibits on them the bad/spoiled/wicked , and lays/raises from them their weight/crime/burden, and the leather or iron collars or handcuffs which was on them, so those who believed with him and supported/aided him , and gave him victory/aid and followed the light which was descended with him, those are the successful/winners.
Say: "You, you the people, I am God's messenger to you all/all together, which for him (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership , no God except Him, He revives/makes alive , and He makes die, so believe by God, and His messenger the prophet the illiterate/belonging to a nation who believes by God, and His words/expressions, and follow him, maybe/perhaps you be guided."
And from Moses' nation, a nation/generation guiding with the truth , and with it they are being just/equitable .
And We separated/divided them (into) twelve (F) branches/Jewish tribes nations, and We inspired/transmitted to Moses, when his nation asked him for drink, that strike/move the stone with your stick/cane, so twelve (F) water springs/water wells flowed/gushed/spouted from it, every/each people had known their drinking place, and We shadowed/overshadowed on them the clouds, and We descended on them the manna/sap , and the quail/amusement, eat from goodnesses what We provided for you, and they did not cause injustice to Us/oppress Us, and but they were causing injustice/oppression (to) themselves .
And if (it) was said to them: "Reside/inhabit this the village/urban city, and eat from it where/when you willed/wanted, and say humility/humbleness , and enter the door/entrance prostrating, We forgive for you your sins/mistakes , We will increase the good doers."
So those who were unjust/oppressive exchanged/replaced/substituted a saying/opinion and belief other than which was said to them, so We sent on them filth/torture from the sky/space because (of) what they were causing injustice/oppression.
And ask/question them about the village/urban city that was present (near) the sea/ocean , when they transgress/violate in the Saturday/Sabbath, when the fishes/large fishes/whales comes to them raised high/clearly showing (on the) day of their Sabbath/Saturday, and (the) day they do not observe the Sabbath by resting and worshipping (it) does not come to them, as/like that We test them because (of) what they were debauching .
And when a nation from them said: "Why/for what (do) you preach/advise/warn a nation God (is) making them die/destroying them or torturing them, a strong (severe) torture." They said: "An apology/excuse to your Lord and maybe/perhaps they fear and obey."
So when they forgot what they were reminded with it, We saved/rescued those who forbid/prevent from the bad/evil/harm, and We took those who were unjust/oppressive with strong/severe torture because (of) what they were debauching .
So when they became arrogant/disobedient from what they were forbidden/prevented from it, We said to them: "Be/become despised/diminished apes/monkeys."
And when your Lord announced/informed he will send (E) on them to the Resurrection Day who burdens/imposes upon them the torture's evil/harm , that your Lord (is) quick/fast (E) (in) the punishment, and that He (is) forgiving (E), merciful.
And We separated/divided them in the earth/Planet Earth (into) nations, from them the correct/righteous people, and from them other than that, and We tested them with the goodnesses and the sins/crimes, maybe/perhaps they return.
So from after them succeeded/followed successions, they inherited The Book , they take/receive that enjoyable accessories/non-essentials/vanities the nearer , and they say: "(It) will be forgiven for us." And if enjoyable accessories/non-essentials/vanities similar/equal to it comes to them they take/receive it, was not The Book's promise/covenant being taken on (from) them, that they not say on God except the truth ? And they studied/memorized what is in it, and the home/house (of) the end (other life is) better/best , to those who fear and obey, so do you not reason/understand ?
And those who hold fast/grasp with The Book , and kept up the prayers, that We do not loose/waste the correctings'/repairings' reward/wage .
And if We shook off/rose/spread the mountain above them as if/though it (is) shade and they assumed/suspected that it (is) falling/landing with (on) them, take/receive what We gave/brought you with power/strength and mention/remember what (is) in it, maybe/perhaps you fear and obey.
And when/if your Lord took/received from Adam's sons and daughters from their backs their descendants, and He made them witness/testify on themselves. "Am I not your Lord (E)?" They said: "Yes/certainly, We witnessed/testified." That You say (on) the Resurrection Day: "That We were about this ignoring/disregarding ."
Or you say: "But our fathers shared/made partners (with God) from before, and we were descendants from after them, do you perish us/destroy us because (of) what the wasters/cancellors made/did ?"
And as/like that We detail/explain the evidences/verses , and maybe/perhaps they return.
And read/recite on them whom We gave/brought him Our verses/evidences , so he broke away/separated from it, so the devil followed him, so he was from the misguided .
And if We wanted/willed, We would have risen him with it, and but he (wanted to) perpetuate/immortalize/eternalize the earth/Planet Earth, and he followed his self attraction for desire/love and lust , so his example/proverb (is) like the example (of) the dog, if you burden/load on it, it pants , and if you leave it, it pants, that is (the) example/proverb (of) the nation those who lied/denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences , so narrate/relay the narration/information ,maybe/perhaps they think.
It became bad/evil an example/proverb (of) the nation those who lied/denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences, and were causing injustice/oppression (to) themselves.
Who God guides, so he is the guided, and who He misguides, so those (are) the losing/misguiding and perishing.
And We had created/seeded to Hell many from the Jinns , and the human/mankind, for them (are) hearts/minds they do not understand/learn with it, and for them (are) eyes/sights they do not see/look/understand with it, and for them (are) ears they do not hear/listen with it, those are as the camels/livestock, but they are more misguided, those are the ignoring/neglecting .
And to God (are) the good names, so call Him by it, and leave those who deviate/insult and defame God/argue in His names, they will be reimbursed what they were making/doing .
And from whom We created (is) a nation/generation guiding with the truth , and with it they (are) being just/equitable . 
And those who denied/falsified with Our evidences/verses , We will lead them gradually from where/when they do not know.
And I extend to them in time/life/enjoyment, that My plotting/conspiring (is) solid/tough .
Did they not think (that there is) no insanity/madness with their companion/friend, that he (is) except (a) clear/evident warner/giver of notice?
Do they not look/wonder about in the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's might and power , and what God created from a thing, and that maybe/perhaps their term/time had neared/approached? So with which information/speech after it (do) they believe?
Who God misguides, so (there is) no guide to him, and He leaves them in their tyranny/arrogance being confused/puzzled .
They ask/question you about the Hour/Resurrection , when (is) its anchor/landing , say: "But its knowledge (is) at my Lord, not (no one) uncovers/reveals it to its time except He, (it) became heavy in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, (it) does not come to you except suddenly/unexpectantly." They ask/question you, as (though) you (are) well acquainted/asking persistently (knowledgeable) about it, say: "But its knowledge (is) at God, and but most of the people do not know ."
Say: "I do not own/possess benefit/usefulness and nor harm to myself, except what God willed/wanted, and if I were (to) know the unseen/absent/supernatural , I would have increased from the good/wealth , and the bad/evil/harm would not (have) touched me, that I am except (a) warner/giver of notice and (an) announcer of good news to a nation believing."
He is who created you from one (F) self , and He made/created from it/her its spouse/husband to be tranquil/settle/secure to it/her, so when he covered/had sexual intercourse with her she carried/bore a light weight/pregnancy , so she passed with it, so when she became heavy, they (B) called God their (B)'s Lord: "If (E) You gave us correct/righteous, we will be/become (E) from the thankful/grateful."
So when He gave them (B) correct/righteous, they (B) made/created for Him partners in what He gave them (B), so God (is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified from what they share/make partners (with Him).
Do they share/make partners (with God in) what does not create a thing, and they are, they are being created?
And they are not being able (to give them) a victory and nor give victory/aid (to) themselves?
And if you call them to the guidance, they do not follow you, (it is) equal/alike on you, if you called them, or you are silent.
That those who you call from other than God (are) worshippers/God's slaves similar/equal to you ,so call them so they should answer/reply to you, if you were truthful.
Are for them feet (legs) they walk with it, or (are) for them hands they destroy/attack violently with it, or (are) for them eyes/sights they see/understand with it, or (are) for them ears, they hear/listen with it? Say: "Call your partners (with God) then plot/conspire against me , so you (will) not delay me/give me time ." 
That my guardian/patron (is) God who descended The Book , and He appoints/enables the correct/righteous.
And those who you call from other than Him, they are not able (to) give you victory/aid, and nor give victory/aid (to) themselves.
And if you call them to the guidance, they do not hear/listen, and you see them looking/watching to you, and they are not seeing/understanding .
Take/receive the grace/goodness , and order/command with the kindness/known , and oppose/turn away from the lowly/ignorant .
And if an urge to spoil evil from the devil spoils/urges you to evil (E), so seek protection by God, that He (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
That those who feared and obeyed, if a circler/walker from the devil touched them, they mentioned/remembered , so then they are seeing/understanding .
And their brothers extend/spread them in the misguidance/failure, then they do not lag/fall behind/neglect .
And if you did not bring them with a verse/evidence , they said: "If only you chose/purified it." Say: "But I follow what (is) inspired/transmitted to me from my Lord, those (are) visions/evidences from your Lord, and guidance, and mercy to a nation believing."
And if the Koran is read, so hear/listen to it and listen quietly, maybe/perhaps We have mercy upon you.
And remember/mention your Lord in your self humbly and humiliated, and hiddenly/secretly and other than the publicized/declared from the saying/opinion and belief at the early morning , and the evenings to sunsets , and do not be from the ignoring/disregarding.
That those at your Lord are not being arrogant about worshipping Him, and they praise/glorify Him, and to Him they prostrate. 
They ask/question you about the spoils/gifts . Say: "The spoils/gifts (are) to God and the messenger, so fear and obey God and correct/repair that what is between you, and obey God and His messenger, if you were believing."
But the believers (are) those who if God was mentioned/remembered/praised their hearts/minds become afraid/apprehensive, and if His verses/evidences were read/recited on them, it increased them faith/belief, and on their Lord they depend/trust in .
Those who keep up the prayers and from what We provided for them they spend.
Those, those are the believers truthfully , for them stages/degrees at their Lord and forgiveness and generous provision .
As/like your Lord brought you out from your house/home with the right , and that a group/party from the believers (are) hating (E).
They argue/dispute with you in the right/truth after what was clarified/shown , as if/though they are being driven (herded/pushed) to the death/lifelessness and they are looking/watching .
And if/when God promises you one/any (of) the two groups that it (E) (is) for you, and you wish/love that other than that what is the power and might/weapon's sharpness be for you, and God wants/wills that (He) makes correct the truth with His words/expressions and cuts off/severs the disbelievers' root/remainder.
To make correct the truth and waste/annul/cancel the falsehood , and even if the criminals/sinners hated (it).
If/when you seek/ask for help (from) your Lord, so He answered/replied to you: "That I (am) extending/spreading you with one thousand from the angels following/riding closely behind."
And God did not make him/it except a good news and to assure/tranquillise/secure with him/it your hearts/minds , and the victory/aid is not except from at God, that God (is) glorious/mighty ,wise/judicious.
If/when the slumber/dozing/lethargy covers/comes upon you safety/security from Him, and He descends water on you from the sky to purify/clean you with it and eliminate/wipe off the devil's filth , and to bond/encourage on your hearts/minds and affirm/strengthen with it the feet.
When your Lord inspires/transmits to the angels, "That I (am) with you, so encourage/affirm those who believed, I will throw in those who disbelievers' hearts/minds the terror/fright, so strike/beat above the necks, and strike/beat from them every/each fingertip/finger .
That (is) because they (E) defied/disobeyed God and His messenger, and who defies/disobeys God and His messenger, so then God (is) strong (severe in) the punishment.
That is, so taste/experience it, and that to the disbelievers (is) the fire's torture.
You, you those who believed, if you met/found those who disbelieved marching slowly/creeping, so do not turn away your back/ends from them.
And who turns his back/end away (from) them that day except swerving/inclining to fighting/killing or leaning/enjoining to a group, so he had returned/settled with anger from God, and his shelter/refuge (is) Hell , and how bad (is) the end/destination?
So you did not kill them, and but God killed them, and you did not throw when you threw, and but God threw, and (it is for) God to test the believers from Him a good test, that God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
That is, and that God (is) weakening/enfeebling the disbelievers' plot/conspiracy .
If you seek victory , so the opening/victory had come to you, and if you end/terminate/stop, so it is best for you, and if you return, We return, and your group will never enrich/satisfy at you a thing, and even if (it) became much/plenty , and that God (is) with the believers.
You, you those who believed, obey God and His messenger and do not turn from Him and you are hearing/listening.
And do not be as/like those who said: "We heard/listened." And they do not hear/listen.
That the worst walker/creeper at God (is) the deaf, the mute those who do not reason/understand.
And if God knew (that) in them (there is) goodness He would have made them hear/listen, and if He made them hear/listen, they would have turned away, and (while) they are objecting/opposing .
You, you those who believed, answer/reply to God and to the messenger, if He called you to what revives/makes you alive, and know that God comes between/intervenes between the human/man and his heart/mind and that He, to Him you are being gathered.
And fear (and avoid a) test/torture (that) strikes/hits (E) especially/specifically those who caused injustice/oppression from you, and know that God (is) strong (severe in) the punishment.
And remember when you were little/few weakened in the earth/Planet Earth, you fear that the people snatch (kidnap) you, so He sheltered you and He supported you with His victory/aid, and He provided for you, from the goodnesses , maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
You, you those who believed do not betray/become unfaithful (to) God and the messenger, and you betray/become unfaithful (to) your deposits/securities and you know.
And know that your properties/possessions/wealths and your children (are a) test , and that God at Him (is) a great reward/wage .
You, you those who believed if you fear and obey God, He makes/creates for you a Separation of Right and Wrong , and He covers/substitutes from you your sins/crimes, and forgives for you, and God (is owner) of the grace/favour/blessing, the great.
And when those who disbelieved deceive/scheme at you to affix/affirm you, or kill you, or bring you out, and they scheme/deceive , and God deceives/schemes and God (is) best (of) the deceivers/schemers .
And when Our evidences/verses are read/recited on them, they said: "We had heard/listened, and if we want/will we would have said similar/equal (to) that, that that (is) except the firsts'/beginners' myths/baseless stories ."
And when they said: "Oh God if that was it, the truth from at you, so rain on us stones from the sky/space or come/bring to us with a painful torture."
And God was not to torture them and (while) you are in (between) them, and God was not torturing them and (while) they are asking for forgiveness.
And why (is it) for them that God not torture them and they are objecting/preventing/obstructing from the Mosque the Forbidden/Sacred , and they were not its patrons/supporters , that its patrons/supporters , (are not) except the fearing and obeying, and but most of them do not know .
And their prayers at the House/Home was not except whistling by mouth and echoing/prolonging/clapping ,so taste/experience the torture with what you were disbelieving.
That those who disbelieved spend their properties/possessions/wealths to object/prevent/obstruct from Gods' way/path/sake , so they will spend it, then (it will) be on them grief/weakness , then they (will) be defeated/conquered , and those who disbelieved, to Hell they (will) be gathered.
(It is to) God to distinguish/separate the bad/wicked from the good/pure and make/put the bad/wicked some over some so He piles/ accumulates it all together , so He puts it in Hell , those are, they are the losers/misguided and perished .
Say to those who disbelieved: "If they terminate/stop, (it) will be forgiven for them what had preceded/passed , and if they return, so the first's/beginners'' law/manner had passed/expired ."
And fight/kill them until (there) be no misguidance/betrayal , and the religion, all of it be to God, so if they ended/stopped , so that God (is) seeing/knowing with what they make/do .
And if they turned away, so know that God (is) your owner/master/ally , (He is) best blessed and praised, the king/master, and (He is) best blessed and praised, the victorior/savior.
And know that what you won/obtained by spoils of war from a thing, that to God its fifth and to the messenger and (those) of (E) the relations/near, and the orphans , and the poorest of poor/poor oppressed, and the traveler/stranded traveler, if you had believed by God and what We descended on Our worshipper/slave, (on) the Separation of Right and Wrong Day/Proof Day (the) day the two groups/gatherings met , and God (is) on every thing capable/able .
When you were by the elevated place/edge of the valley the near, and they are by the edge of the valley the farthest, and the riders/caravan/convoy (is) lower from (than) you, and if you made appointments with each other you would have differed/disagreed in the appointment and but (for) God to execute/order an order/command, (it) was made/done, to perish/destroy who perished/died on/of an evidence, and lives who lived on/of an evidence, and that God (is) hearing/listening (E), knowledgeable.
When God shows them to you in your sleep/dream (as) a few/little , and if He showed them to you (as) many/much you would have weakened and become cowardly/failing and you would have disputed/argued in the matter/affair, and but God delivered/secured (saved), that He (is) knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts).
When He shows them to you when you met/found (them) in your eyes/sights (as) few/little, and He lessens/reduces you (P) in their eyes/sights, (it is for) God to execute/order an order/command (that) was made/done, and to God the matters/affairs are returned.
You, you those who believed, if you met/found a group so be courageous/steadfast and remember/mention/glorify God much, maybe/perhaps you succeed/win.
And obey God and His messenger, and do not dispute/quarrel so you fail/become weakened and your wind/breeze (energy & strength) goes/goes away , and be patient, that God (is) with the patient.
And do not be as/like those who got out/emerged from their homes/houses ungratefully/arrogantly and showing off/pretending to the people , and they object/obstruct from God's way/path , and God (is) with what they make/do surrounding/comprehending .
And when the devil decorated/beautified for them their works/deeds , and he said: "No defeater/conqueror from the people for you today and that I am a savior/rescuer for you." So when the two groups saw each other, he returned/withdrew on his two heels, and he said: "That I am innocent/renouncing/separating from you, that I, I see/understand what you do not see/understand, that I, I fear God, and God (is) strong (severe) in the punishment."
When/if the hypocrites and those who in their hearts/minds (there) is sickness/disease say: "Those, their religion has deceived/tempted (them)." And who relies/depends on God, so then God (is) glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.
And if you see/understand when the angels make those who disbelieved die, they strike/beat their faces/fronts and their backs/ends, and (they say): "Taste/experience the burning torture."
That (is) with what your hands advanced/undertook , and that God (is) not with an unjust/oppressor to the worshippers/slaves.
As pharaoh's family's affairs/habits and those from before them, they disbelieved with Gods' verses/evidences , so God took/punished them because of their crimes, that God (is) strong/powerful strong (severe in) the punishment.
That (is) with that God is/was not changing a blessing/goodness He blessed/comforted and eased it on a nation, until they change what (is) with themselves, and that God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
As Pharaoh's family's affairs/habits and those from before them, they denied/falsified with God's verses/evidences , so We made them die/destroyed them because of their crimes, and We drowned/sunk Pharaoh's family, and all/each were unjust/oppressors.
That the worst walkers/creepers at God (are) those who disbelieved, so they do not believe.
Those (are) from them (who) you made a contract/entrusted , then they break/destroy their promise/contract in every time , and they do no fear and obey.
So when you defeat/overtake them in the battle/war so expel/separate with them from behind them, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember . 
And if you fear from a nation betrayal/unfaithfulness, so discard/reject to them on straightness , that God does not love/like the betrayers/unfaithfuls.
And those who disbelieved do not think/suppose (that) they raced/went ahead/won, that they truly do not disable/frustrate.
And prepare for them what you were able from strength/power and from the horses'/horsemens' ties/strings/strength , you terrorize/terrify with it God's enemy, and your enemy, and others from other than them, you do not know them, God knows them, and what you spend from a thing in God's sake/way is fulfilled/completed to you, and you are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
And if they sided/inclined towards to the peace/surrender , so side/incline towards to it, and rely/depend on God, that He truly is, He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
And if they want that they deceive you, so that God (is) enough for you, He is who supported you with His victory/aid and with the believers.
And He united/joined between their hearts/minds , if you spent what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all/all together, you would not (have) united/joined between their hearts/minds , and but God united/joined between them, that He truly is glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.
You, you the prophet, God is enough for you and who followed you from the believers.
You, you the prophet, instigate/urge/encourage the believers on (to) the fighting/killing. If (there) be twenty patient from you, they will defeat/conquer two hundred, and if (there) be one hundred from you, they defeat/conquer a thousand, from those who disbelieved, because they (E) (are) a nation (that) do not understand/know .
Now God reduced/lightened from you, and He knew that in you (is) weakness, so if (there) be from you one hundred patient, they defeat/conquer two hundred, and if (there) be from you a thousand, they defeat/conquer two thousand with God's permission/pardon, and God (is) with the patient.
(It) was not to a prophet that (there) be for him captives/prisoners so that he hardens/exceeds in killing (tyrannizes) in the earth/Planet Earth, you want the present world's enjoyable accessories/vanities , and God wants the end (other life), and God (is) glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.
Where it not for a Book/decree/term preceded from God, a great torture would have touched you in what you took/received.
So eat from what you won/gained by spoils of war (it is) permitted/allowed enjoyable/allowed/permitted, and fear and obey God, that God (is) forgiving merciful.
You, you the Prophet, say to whom (is) in your hands from the captives/prisoners: "If God knows (there) is in your hearts/minds (from) goodness , He gives/brings to you better than what was taken from you, and He forgives for you, and God (is) forgiving, merciful."
And if they want your betrayal/unfaithfulness, so they had betrayed/become unfaithful to God from before, so He gave others high position/strength from them, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
That those who believed and emigrated and struggled/exerted , with their properties/possessions and themselves in God's sake/way , and those who sheltered/gave refuge and saved/gave victory/aided, those, some of them (are) guardians/patrons/allies (to) some, and those who believed and did not emigrate, their guardianship/patronage is not for (on) you from a thing (your responsibility) until they emigrate, and if they asked you to save/aid them in the religion, so the victory/aid is on you (your duty) except on a nation between you and between them (is) a promise/covenant, and God (is) with what you made/do seeing/knowing .
And those who disbelieved some of them (are) guardians/allies (of) some, if you not make/do it, it (will) be misguidance/betrayal in the earth/Planet Earth, and big/great corruption/disorder .
And those who believed and emigrated and struggled/exerted in God's sake/way , and those who sheltered/gave refuge and saved/gave victory/aided, those, they are the believers truly/certainly , for them (is) a forgiveness and a generous/gracious provision.
And those who believed from after and emigrated and struggled/exerted with you, so those (are) from you, and of the relations some of them (are) more worthy/deserving with some in God's Book , that God (is) with every thing knowledgeable.  
Innocence/denouncement from God and His messenger to those who you promised/made a contract (with) them from the sharers/takers of partners (with God).
So walk/go/travel in the earth/Planet Earth, four months, and know that you are not disabling/frustrating God, and that God is shaming/scandalizing those who disbelieved.
And announcement/information from God and His messenger to the people, (on) day (of) the pilgrimage the greatest/biggest , that God (is) innocent/renouncing , from the sharers/takers of partners (with Him) , and His messenger, so if you repented, so it is best for you, and if you turned away, so know that you are not disabling/frustrating God, and announce good news (to) those who disbelieved with a painful torture.
Except those who you promised/made a contract (with) them, from the sharers/takers of partners (with God), then they did not reduce/decrease you (in) a thing, and they did not cooperate/support/help anyone on (against) you, so complete to them their promise/contract to their period/term , that God loves/likes the fearing and obeying.
So if the months the forbidden/sacred ended/passed , so fight/kill the sharers/takers of partners (with God) where/when you found them, and take/punish them and restrict/confine them and remain/be concerned and prepared/beset for them (in) every lookout/observatory , so if they repented, and kept up the prayers and gave/brought the charity/ purification , so free their way/path , that God (is) forgiving, merciful.
And if any (from) the sharers/takers of partners (with God) seeked your protection/defense so protect/defend him, until he hears God's speech/conversation (words), then deliver him/make him reach his safety/security, that (is) because they are (E) a nation (that) do not know.
How (can there) be for the sharers/takers of partners (with God) a promise/contract at God and at His messenger, except those who you promised/made a contract (with) at the Mosque the Forbidden/Sacred ,so what they became straight/direct for you, so be straight/direct for them, that God loves/likes the fearing and obeying.
How, and if they conquer/defeat on you, they do not observe/guard (respect) in you a relationship/contract and nor promise/contract/guarantee , they please/satisfy you with their mouths and their hearts/minds refuse/hate, and most of them (are) debauchers .
They bought/volunteered with God's verses/evidences a small price, so they prevented/obstructed from His road/path , that they truly are bad/evil/harmful what they were making/doing .
They do not observe/guard (respect) in a believer a relationship/contract and nor promise/contract/ guarantee, and those are the transgressors .
So if they repented and kept up the prayers and gave/brought the charity/purification , so (they are) your brothers in the religion, and We detail/explain the verses/evidences to a nation knowing.
And if they broke/violated their oaths from after their promise and they defamed/stabbed in yourreligion so fight/kill (the) leaders/examples (of) the disbelief, that they truly (have) no oaths/swearings for them, maybe/perhaps they terminate/stop.
Do you not fight/kill a nation (that) broke/violated their oaths , and they got interested/began by forcing out the messenger, and they started/initiated (the) first time with you, do you fear them? So God (is) more worthy/deserving that you fear Him if you were believing.
Fight/kill them, God tortures them with your hands and He shames/disgraces them and He gives you victory/aid on (over) them, and He cures/heals (the) chests (innermosts of) a believing nation.
And He takes away/eliminates their heart's/mind's anger/rage, and God forgives on whom He wills/wants, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious
Or (have) you thought/supposed that you be left, and God did not knowthose who struggled/exerted from you, and they did not take from other than God and nor His messenger and nor the believers a close and dependable friend/(for sharing) innermost thoughts or feelings, and God (is) expert/experienced with what you make/do .
(It) was not to the sharers/takers of partners (with God) that they inhabit/tend to/visit God's mosques/places of worshipping God, (while) witnessing/testifying on themselves with the disbelief, those, their deeds (are) wasted, and in the fire they are immortally/eternally.
But (those who) tend to/visit God's mosques/places of worshipping God (are) who believed by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and kept up the prayers, and gave/brought the charity/purification , and did not fear except God, so maybe/perhaps that those they be from the guided.
Did you make the pilgrimage's drinking place/cup (water carrying) and tending to/visiting the Mosque the Forbidden/Sacred as who believed with God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and struggled/exerted in God's way/sake ? They do not become equal/alike at God, and God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive.
Those who believed and emigrated and struggled/exerted in God's way/sake with their properties/wealths and themselves, (are) a step/degree greater at God, and those, they are the winners/successful .
their Lord announces good news to them with a mercy from Him and acceptance/approval , and treed gardens/paradises for them in it (is) continuing blessing/comfort and ease .
Immortally/eternally in it, eternally/forever, that God at Him (is a) great reward .
You, you those who believed, do not take your fathers and your brothers (as) guardians/allies if they loved/liked the disbelief more (preferred) over the belief, and who follows them from you, so those, those are the unjust/oppressors.
Say: "If your fathers, and your sons, and your brothers, and your spouses and your father's near relations/tribe, and properties/wealths you committed/perpetrated it, and commercial trade you fear its slump/depression , and residence you accept/approve it, (are) more lovable/likable to you than God and His messenger and struggling/defending for the faith in His way/path , so wait/remain until God comes with His order/command, and God does not guide the nation the debauchers .
God had given you victory/aid in many homelands/battlefields and Hunain's Day (the location of the famous battle between Arab tribes and Moslems), when your plentifulness pleased/marveled you, so (it) did not enrich/satisfy from you a thing, and the Earth/land narrowed/tightened on you with what (it) widened/broadened (its vastness/expanse), then you turned away giving (your) backs.
Then God descended His tranquillity/calm on His messenger and on the believers, and He descended soldiers/warriors you did not see it, and He tortured those who disbelieved, and that (is) the disbeliever's reward/reimbursement .
Then God forgives from after that on whom He wills/wants, and God (is) forgiving, merciful.
You, you those who believed but/truly the sharers/takers of partners (with God are) impurity/contamination , so they do not approach/near the Mosque the Forbidden/Sacred after this their year, and if you feared need/necessity/poverty, so God will/shall enrich/suffice you from His grace/favour , if He willed/wanted, that God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
Fight/kill those who do not believe with God and nor the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and do not forbid/prohibit what God and His messenger forbid/prohibited, and do not take/adopt a religion the correct/right religion from those who were given/brought The Book , until they give/hand over the fee paid by non-Moslems living in a Moslem society (paid instead of Zakat by Moslems) from a hand, and (while) they are subservient/humiliated .
And the Jews said: "Ezra (is) God's son", and the Christians , said: "The Messiah, (is) God's son." That (is) their saying/word/opinion and belief with their mouths, they equal/resemble (the) saying/word/opinion and belief (of) those who disbelieved from before, God fought/killed them, how (do) they be lied to/be turned away?
They took their religious scholars and their monks (as) lords from other than God and the Messiah, Mary's Son, and they were not ordered/commanded except to worship one God, no God except He, His praise/glory from what they share/make partners (with God).
They want that they extinguish/put out God's light with their mouths, and God refuses/hates except that He completes His light, and even if the disbelievers hated (it).
He (is) who sent His messenger with the guidance, and the correct/truth religion, to make it apparent/visible on the religion(s) all of it, and even if the sharers/takers of partners (with God) hated (it).
You, you those who believed that many of the religious scholars , and the monks eat (E) the people's properties/wealths by the falsehood, and prevent/obstruct from God's way/path , and those who accumulate/herd the gold and the silver and do not spend it in God's way/path , so announce good news to them with a painful torture.
A day (when) be heated on it in Hell's fire, so their foreheads' skin will be burned by an iron with it (the gold and silver), and their sides, and their backs, "That (is) what you accumulated/hoarded to your selves, so taste/experience what you were accumulating/hoarding ." 
That the months' number/count at God (are) twelve in God's scripture , (on) the day He created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, from it four (are) sacred, that (is) the religion the straight , so do not cause injustice to/oppress your selves in them, and fight/kill the sharers/takers of partners (with God) all, as/like they fight/kill you all, and know that God (is) with the fearing and obeying.
But the delayment/postponement (is) an increase in the disbelief, those who disbelieved become misguided with it, they permit/allow it (for) a year and they forbid/prohibit it (for) a year, to agree to (the) term (that) God forbid/prohibited, so they permit/allow what God forbade/prohibited, and (the) bad/evil (of) their deeds was decorated/beautified for them, and God does not guide the nation the disbelieving.
You, you those who believed, why (is it) to you, if (it) is said to you: "Rush/hasten in God's sake ," you become heavy/burdened in the earth/Planet Earth? Did you accept/become content with the life the present/worldly life, (other) than the end (other life)? So the present world's/worldly life's long life/enjoyment is not except little/small in the end (other life).
Unless you rush/hasten , He tortures you a painful torture and He exchanges/substitutes a nation other than you, and you do not harm him (in) a thing, and God (is) on every thing capable/powerful .
If you do not give Him victory/aid, so God had given him victory/aid when those who disbelieved brought him out/drove him out, second (of) two, when they (B) are (in) the cave , when he says to his companion/friend: "Do not be sad/grievous, that God (is) with us." So God descended His tranquillity/calm on him, and He supported him with soldiers you do not see it, and He made (the) word/expression (of) those who disbelieved the lowest/bottom most, and God's word/expression it is the high/elevated, and God (is) glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.
Rush/hasten lights and heavy/loaded, and struggle/do your utmost with your properties/possessions and yourselves in God's sake , that (is) best for you, if you were knowing.
If (it) was near/close enjoyable accessories/vanities , and an easy and light journey/trip , they would have followed you, and but the hard to reach distance it became distant/far on (for) them, and they will swear/take oath by God: "If we were able we would have gotten out/emerged with you." They perish/destroy themselves, and God knows that they truly are lying/denying (E) .
God forgave/pardoned from you/for what you permitted/allowed for them, until those who were truthful become clear/shown to you, and you know the liars/deniers .
Those who believe by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day do not ask for your permission/pardon that they struggle/do their utmost with their properties/possessions and themselves, and God (is) knowledgeable with the fearing and obeying.
But those who ask for your permission/pardon (are those who) do not believe by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day and their hearts/minds became doubtful/suspicious, so they are in their doubt/suspicion hesitating.
And if they wanted/intended the exit they would have prepared (E) for it tools/outfit and but God hated their urging to get out (to battle) so He blocked/ delayed them and (it) was said: "Sit/remain  with the sitting/remaining."
If they got out/emerged in between you, they did not increase you except degeneration/corruption and they would have put in between and around you, (and) they desired (for) you the treason/misguidance , and in you (there are those) hearing/listening to them, and God (is) knowledgeable with (of) the unjust/oppressive.
They had desired the treason/misguidance from before, and they turned/changed for you the matters/affairs until the truth came, and God's order/command appeared and they are hating.
And from them who says: "Permit/allow for me, and do not test/misguide me " Is it not in the treason/misguidance (that) they dropped/erred , and that Hell is surrounding (E) with the disbelievers.
If goodness strikes you it harms them , and if disaster/every thing hated strikes you , they say: "We had taken our matter/affair from before." And they turn away and they are happy/delighted .
Say: "(Nothing) will never/not strike/hit us except what God ordered/decreed for us, He is our owner/master/ally , and on God so should rely/depend the believers."
Say: "Do you wait/remain with us except (that) one (of) the two goods (afflicts us), and we wait/remain with you that God strikes/hits you with torture from at Him or with our hands, so wait/remain , we are with you waiting/remaining."
Say: "Spend voluntarily or forcefully/involuntarily , (it) will never/not be accepted from you, that you are/were a nation (of) debauchers ."
And nothing prevented/prohibited them that their expenses/expenditures that (E) be accepted/received from them, except that they disbelieved by God, and with His messenger and they do not come (to) the prayers except and (while) they are lazy, and they do not spend except and (while) they are hating.
So let not their properties/wealths , and nor their children please/marvel you, but God wants to torture them with it in the life the present/worldly life, and their selves perish/vanish and (while) they are disbelieving.
And they swear/take oath by God, that they truly are from you (E), and they are not from you, and however they are a nation afraid/separating.
If they find a refuge/shelter or caves or an entrance they would have turned away to it, and they bolt/run away uncontrollably.
And from them who backbite/find fault in you in the charities, so if they were given/handed from it they accepted/approved, and if they were not given/handed from it, then they are hating/becoming angry .
And if that they accepted/approved what God and His messenger gave/brought them and they said: "Enough for us God, God will give/bring us from His grace/favour and His messenger, we are to God desiring/wishing."
But the charities (are) to the poor/needy , and the poorest of poor/poor oppressed, and the doers/workers on it, and (those who) their hearts/minds (are) united/joined , and in the necks (freeing) slaves, and the obliged indebted , and in God's sake/path , and the traveler/stranded traveler (it is) a religious duty/stipulation from God, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious. 
And from them those who harm mildly the prophet and say: "He is hearing." Say: "(He is a) good ear/hearing for you, he believes by God and he believes to the believers, and mercy to those who believed from you, and those who harm mildly God's messenger, for them (is) a painful torture."
They swear/take oath by God for you, to please/satisfy you, and God and His messenger (are) more worthy/deserving (that) they please/satisfy Him, if they were believing.
Did they not know that he/who angers God and His messenger, so that truly for him (is) Hell's fire, immortally/eternally in it, that (is) the shame/scandal , the great.
The hypocrites are afraid/cautious that a chapter of the Koran be descended on them to inform them with what (is) in their hearts/minds . Say: "Mock/make fun , that God (is) bringing out what you are cautious/afraid of."
And if (E) you asked/questioned them, they will say (E): "But we were plunging into/engaging in conversation and we were playing/amusing ." Say: "Is with/by God and His evidences/verses , and His messenger you were mocking ?"
Do not apologize/find excuses, you had disbelieved after your belief, if We forgive/pardon on a group of people from you, We torture a group of people because they were criminals/sinners.
The hypocrites (M) and the hypocrites (F) some of them (are) from some (they are for each other), they order/command by the defiance of God and His orders/awfulness/obscenity , and they forbid/prevent from the kindness/generosity and they grasp/tighten/hold their hands, they forgot God, so He forgot them, that the hypocrites, they are the debauchers .
God promised the hypocrites (M) and the hypocrites (F) and the disbelievers Hell's fire immortally/eternally in it, it is enough for them, and God cursed/humiliated them and for them (is a) continuing torture.
As/like those from before them they were stronger than you, (in) strength/power and (with) more properties/possessions , and children, so they lived long/enjoyed with their good luck/fortune, so you lived long/enjoyed with your good luck/fortune, as those from before you lived long/enjoyed with their good luck/fortune, and you plunged into/engaged in conversation as/like who plunged into/engaged in conversation , those their deeds (are) wasted in the present world, and the end (other life), and those, they are the losers .
Did not (the) information/news come to them (about) those from before them, Noah's nation, and Aad , and Thamud and Abraham's nation, and owners (of) Madya/Madyan, and the overturned cities ?Their messengers came to them with the evidences, so God was not to cause injustice to them/oppress them, and but they were themselves causing injustice/oppression.
And the believers (M) and believers (F) some of them (are) guardians/allies (to) some, they order/command with the kindness/generosity , and they forbid/prevent from the defiance of God and His orders/obscenity ,and they keep up the prayers, and they give the charity/purification and they obey God and His messenger, those, God will have mercy upon them, that God (is) glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.
God promised the believers (M) and the believers (F) treed gardens/paradises the rivers flow from below/beneath it immortally/eternally in it and beautiful residences in treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, and acceptance/approval from God (is) greater that it is the winning/triumph , the great.
You, you the prophet, struggle/do your utmost (against) the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be hard/rough on them, and their shelter/refuge (is) Hell , and how bad (is) the end/destination?
They swear/take oath by God, (that) they did not say, and (but) they had said the disbelief's word/expression ,and they disbelieved after their Islam/submission/surrender, and they got interested/resolved with what they did not take/receive/obtain, and they did not revenge/criticize except that God and His messenger enriched them from His grace , so if they repent (it will) be best for them, and if they turn away, God tortures them a painful torture in the present world and the end (other life), and in the earth/Planet Earth no guardian/ally and nor victorior/savior (be) for them .
And from them who promised God: "If (E) He gave us from His grace/favour we will give charity (E) and we will be/become from the correct/righteous."
So when He gave them from His grace/favour they were stingy/miser with it, and they turned away and (while) they are objecting/opposing .
So hypocrisy in their hearts/minds followed/succeeded them to a day they meet/find Him because (of) what they broke (their promise to) God (in) what they promised Him, and because (of) what they were lying/denying .
Did they not know that God knows their secret and their confidential talk/secret conversation, and that God (is) all knower (of) the unseens/invisible/(unknowns)?
Those who backbite/find fault in the volunteers from the believers in the charities, and those who do not find except their struggle/exertion so they humiliate/ridicule from them, God mocked/ridiculed from them, and for them (is) a painful torture.
Ask for forgiveness for them or you do not ask for forgiveness for them, if you ask for forgiveness for them seventy time(s), so God will never/not forgive for them, that (is) because they (E) disbelieved by God and His messenger, and God does not guide the nation the debauchers .
The remaining behind rejoiced/delighted with their seat/sitting place (position) opposite/behind God's messenger, and they hated that they struggle/exert with their properties/wealths and themselves in Gods' sake , and they said: "Do not rush/hasten in the heat." Say: "Hell's fire (is) stronger heat, if they were understanding/learning ."
So they will laugh (E) little and they will weep (E) much, reimbursement because (of) what they were earning/gaining/acquiring .
So if God returned you to a group of people from them, so they asked for permission from you to the getting out/exit (battle), so say: "You will never/not get out/emerge with me ever (E), and you will never/not fight/kill with me an enemy, that you accepted/became content with the sitting/remaining behind (the) first time , so sit/remain with the remaining behind." 
And do not ever pray on anyone from them (that) died, and do not stand on his grave/burial place, that they truly disbelieved by God and His messenger, and they died and (while) they are debauchers .
And let (not) their properties/wealths and their children please/marvel you, but God wants that He tortures them with it in the present world and their selves go out/perish and (while) they are disbelieving.
And if a chapter was descended: "That believe by God, and struggle/do your utmost with His messenger." Those of the wealth/arrogance asked for permission/pardon from you, and they said: "Leave us be with the sitting/remaining."
They accepted/approved with that they be with the remaining behind and, (it) was closed/sealed on their hearts/minds so they do not understand/learn .
However the messenger and those who believed with him struggled/exerted with their properties/possessions and their selves, those, for them (is) the goodnesses/generosity, and those are the successful/winners.
God prepared for them treed gardens/paradises the rivers flow from below/beneath it, (they are) immortally/eternally in it, that (is) the great, the triumph/salvation .
And the apologizers/excuse givers from the Arabs came to be permitted/allowed to them, and those who denied God and His messenger sat/remained behind , those who disbelieved from them a painful torture will strike/hit (them).
Strain/sin/hardship is not on the weak ones, and nor on the sick/diseased, and nor on those who do not find what they (should) spend, if they were faithful/sincere to God and His messenger, (there) is not from a way/path on the good doers, and God (is) a forgiving, merciful.
And nor on those when/if they came to you to carry/bear them, you said: "I do not find what I carry you on it." They turned away and their eyes flow/over flow from the tears, sadness/grief that they not find what they (can) spend.
But the way/path (is) on those who ask for permission/pardon of you and they are rich, they accepted ,with that they be with the remaining behind, and God stamped/sealed on their hearts/minds , so they do not know.
They apologize/excuse (themselves) to you, if you returned to them, say: "Do not apologize/excuse (yourselves), we will never believe for you, God had informed us from your news/information , and God will see your deed and His messenger, then you (will) be returned to knower (of) the unseen/absent and the testimony/certification , so He informs you with what you were making/doing .
They will swear by God to you if you returned to them to object/oppose from them, so object/oppose from them, that they truly are obscenity/filth , and their shelter/refuge (is) Hell because (of) what they were earning/acquiring .
They swear/take oath to you to accept/approve of them, so if you accept/approve of them, so that God does not accept/approve of the nation the debauchers .
The Arabs (are) stronger (in) disbelief and hypocrisy, and more worthy/suited that they not know limits/boundaries/orders (of) what God descended on His messenger, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
And from the Arabs who takes what he spends (as) an obligated burden/monetary harm/loss , and he waits/remains with you the circles/disasters; on them (is) the bad/evil circle/disaster, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
And from the Arabs who believes by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and takes what he spends (as) approachment to God (offerings) at God, and the messenger's prayers, is it not an approachment to God (offering) for them? God will make them enter in His mercy, that God (is) forgiving, merciful.
And the racing/preceding the first/beginners from the emigrants and the victoriors/saviors , and those who followed them with goodness, God accepted/approved of them, and they accepted/approved of Him, and He prepared for them treed gardens/paradises the rivers flow/run below/beneath it, immortally/eternally for ever in it, that (is) the great winning/triumph .
And from whom (is) around/surrounding you from the Arabs (are) hypocrites and from the city's/town's people they were accustomed to rebelling/mutiny on the hypocrisy, you do not know them, We know them, We will torture them twice, then they be returned to great torture.
And others confessed/acknowledged because of their crimes, they mixed/mingled correct/righteous deeds work and other bad/evil, maybe/perhaps God that He forgives on them, that God (is) forgiving, merciful.
Take/receive from their properties/wealths charity, to purify/clean them mentally and physically , and to purify/correct/commend them with it, and pray/call (for) God's blessings on them, that your prayers (are) tranquillity/security for them, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
Did they not know that God, He accepts/receives the repentance/forgiveness from His worshippers/slaves, and He takes/receives the charities, and that God, He is the forgiver, the merciful?
And say: "Make/work , so God and His messenger and the believers will see your deeds, and you will be returned to knower (of) the unseen/supernatural and the testimony/certification , so He informs you with what you were making/doing."
And others (are) delayed/postponed to God's order/command, either He torturers them and either He forgives on them, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
And those who took a mosque (as a tool for) harming, and disbelief, and separation/distinction between the believers, and (as) a watch/observation/ambuscade (ambush place/shelter) to who battled/fought God and His messenger from before, and they swear/take oath (E): "That we wanted/intended except the best/goodness ." And God witnesses/testifies that they truly are lying/denying .
Do not stand in it ever (E), a mosque/place of worshipping God (E) founded (established) on the fear and obedience (of God) from (the) first day (is) more worthy/deserving that you stand in it, in it (are) men they love/like that they purify themselves mentally and physically , and God loves/likes the pure/clean .
Is who founded (established) his building/structure on fear and obedience from God and acceptance/approval better ? Or who founded (established) his building/structure on (the) edge/brink (of) a cracking/falling/weakly undercut bank/shore , so it collapsed/fell down with him in Hell's fire? And God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive.
Their buildings/structures which they built/constructed still is doubt/suspicion in their hearts/minds ,except/unless that their hearts/minds be cut , and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
That God bought from the believers their selves and their properties/wealths , with that for them (is) the Paradise, they fight/kill in God's sake , so they fight/kill and they be fought/killed, a promise truthfully in the Torah/Old Testament, and the Bible/New Testament , and the Koran , and who (is) more fulfilling/completing with his promise/pledge than God? So be announced good news with your sale/trade which you sold/traded with it, and that (is) the great, the triumph/salvation .
The repentant, the worshippers, the praising , the travelers/tourists for knowledge , the bowing , the prostrating, the ordering/commanding with the kindness/generosity, and the forbidding/preventing from the defiance of God and His orders/obscenity , and the protectors/observers to God's limits/boundaries , and announce good news (to) the believers.
(It) was not to the prophet and those who believed that they ask for forgiveness to the sharers/takers of partners (with God) , and even if they were of (the) relations/near from after what was clarified/explained to them, that they are the roaring fires'/Hell's owners/friends .
Abraham's asking for forgiveness for his father was not except on a promise he promised it (to only) him, so when (it) was clarified/explained to him, that he (his father is) an enemy to God, he declared innocence from him, that Abraham (is a) clement groaner/moaner (E) .
And God was not to misguide (a) nation after when He guided them, until He clarifies/explains to them what they fear and obey, that God was/is with every thing knowledgeable.
That God (has) for him the skies'/space's ownership/kingdom , He revives/makes alive, and He makes die, and (there is) none for you from other than God from (a) guardian/ally and nor (a) victorior/savior .
God had forgiven on the prophet and the emigrants and the victoriors those who followed him in (the) hour (of) the difficulty/hardship from after what (the) hearts/minds (of) a group/party from them, was about to/almost deviate , then He forgave on them, that He truly is merciful/compassionate, merciful with them.
And on the three, those who remained until when the Earth/land narrowed/tightened on them with what (it) widened/broadened and their selves narrowed/tightened on them, and they thought/assumed that (there is) no refuge/shelter from God except to Him, then He forgave on them, (it is for them) to repent, that God, (He is) the forgiving, the merciful/most merciful.
You, you those who believed, fear and obey God and be with the truthful.
(It) was not to the city's/town's family/relation/people and who (is) around/surrounding them from the Arabs , that they delay (remain behind) from God's messenger, and nor they wish/desire with themselves from his self/himself, that (is) because they (E) (experience) no thirst, and nor hardship/fatigue , and nor hunger strikes them in God's sake , and they do not step on/set foot on a foothold (that) angers/enrages the disbelievers, and they do not take/obtain (win) from an enemy receiving/obtaining (winning) except (that) it was written/decreed for them with it, correct/righteous deeds , that God does not loose/waste/destroy the good doer's reward/wage .
And they do not spend a small/little, and nor great/large expense/expenditure, and nor cross a valley, except it was written/decreed for them, (it is for) God to reward/compensate them (the) best (of) what they were making/doing .
And the believers were not to rush/hasten all (to battle) , so if only (there were) a group from every group/party from them, a group of people to learn/comprehend/have knowledge in the religion, and to warn/give notice (to) their nation if they returned to them, maybe/perhaps they be warned/cautioned .
You, you those who believed, fright/kill those who follow/near you evilly from the disbelievers, and they should find in you strength/coarseness , and know that God (is) with the fearing and obeying.
And when any chapter of the Koran was descended, so from them who says: "Which of you (has) this it increased him faith/belief?" So but those who believed, so it increased them faith/belief, and they be announced good news to/be cheerful .
And but those who in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease, so it increased them obscenity/filth to their obscenity/filth , and they died and they are disbelieving.
Do they not see/understand that they are being tested in every year once or twice , then they do not repent, and they do not mention/remember ?
And when any chapter of the Koran was descended, some of them looked to some, (and said): "Does from anyone see you?" Then they went away/diverted , God diverted their hearts/minds , because they are (E) a nation (that) do not understand/know .
A messenger had come to you from your selves, powerfull (painful/dear) on him what you suffered (from) exertion/hardship, holding onto stingily and desiring strongly (careful) on you, with the believers merciful/compassionate, merciful.
So if they turned away, so say: "Enough for me God, no God except He, on Him I relied/depended, and He is Lord (of) the throne, the great."
A L R , those are the wise/judicious Book's verses/evidences .
Was it to the people astonishment/surprise that We inspired/transmitted to a man from them: "That warn/give notice (to) the people and announce good news (to) those who believed that for them (is) a foot (hold) (of) truth at their Lord." The disbelievers said: "That, that (is) an evident magician/sorcerer."
That your Lord (is) God who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth in six days then He aimed to/tended to on the throne , He plans/regulates the matter/affair, (there is) no/none from a mediator except from after His permission/pardon, that one (is) God, your Lord, so worship Him, so do you not mention/remember/praise ?
To Him (is) your return all/all together, God's promise truthfully , that He truly starts/initiates the creation, then He returns/repeats it to reward/reimburse those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds with the just/equitable, and those who disbelieved for them (is) a drink from hot/cold water and a painful torture because (of) what they were disbelieving.
He is who made/put the sun light/shining and the moon a light, and He predestined/evaluated it places of descent/sequences/descents to know (the) number/numerous (of) the years and the counting/calculating, God did not create that except with the truth , He details/explains the verses/evidences to a nation knowing.
That in difference (of) the night and the daytime and what God created in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (are) signs/evidences (E) to a nation fearing and obeying.
That those who do not hope/expect meeting Us, and they accepted/approved with the life the present/the worldly life, and they became assured/secured with it, and those who they are from Our verses/evidences ignoring/disregarding .
Those, their shelter/refuge (is) the fire because (of) what they were acquiring/gathering .
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, their Lord guides them because of their faith/belief (to) the rivers flowing/running from below/beneath them in the blessing/goodness (of) treed gardens/paradises.
Their call/prayer in it (is): "Oh/you God Your praise/glory." And their greeting in it (is): "Security/peace." and their last call/prayer (is): "That the praise/gratitude (is) to God the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
And if God hurries/hastens the bad/evil/harm to the people (as) their hurrying/hastening with the good/wealth , their term/time would have been executed/accomplished to them, so We leave those who do not expect meeting Us in their tyranny/arrogance being confused/puzzled .
And if the human (was) touched (by) the harm he called Us to his side or sitting or standing , so when We removed/uncovered from him his harm, he passed as if/though he did not call Us to harm (that) touched him,as/like that (it) was decorated/beautified to the spoilers/neglecters what they were making/doing .
And We had destroyed the generations/peoples of eras from before you, when they caused injustice/oppression, and their messengers came to them with the evidences, and they were not to believe, as/like that We reward/reimburse the nation the criminals/sinners.
Then We made/put you (as) caliphs/successors and replacers/leaders in the earth/Planet Earth from after them to see how you do .
And if Our signs/verses evidences are read/recited on them, those who do not hope/expect meeting Us said: "Come/bring with a Koran other than that or exchange/replace it ." Say: "(It) is not to me that I exchange/replace it from my self/spontaneously/willingly that I follow except what is inspired/revealed to me, that I fear if I disobeyed my Lord (from) a great day's torture."
Say: " If God wanted/willed I would not (have) read/recited it on you, and He would not (have) informed you with (of) it, so I had stayed/remained in (between) you a life time from before it, so do you not reason/understand ?
So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on God lies/denials/falsifications or lied/falsified with His verses/evidences ? That He does not make the criminals/sinners succeed/win
And they worship from other than God what does not harm them and nor benefit them, and they say: "Those (are) our mediators at God." Say: "Do you inform God with what He does not know in the skies/space and nor in the earth/Planet Earth?" His praise/glory and high, mighty, exalted and dignified from what they share/make partners (with God).
And the people were not except one nation , so they differed/disagreed/disputed, and where it not for a word preceded from your Lord, (it) would have executed/ended (E) between them, in what they are in it differing/disagreeing .
And they say: "If only an evidence/sign was descended on him from his Lord." So say: "But the absent/supernatural (is) to God so wait , that I am with you from the waiting .
And if We made the people taste/experience mercy from after calamity/disastrous distress touched them, then for them (is) cheatery/deceit/schemes in Our verses/evidences . Say: "God (is) quicker/faster (in) cunning/scheming , that Our messengers write what you cheat/ deceive/scheme."
He is who makes you walk/move/ride in the shore/land and the sea (large body of water) until when you were in the ships, and We flowed/ran with them with a good/enjoyable wind/breeze, and they became happy/rejoiced with it, (then) a stormy/violent wind came to it, and the waves/surges came to them from every place, and they thought/assumed that they are (being) surrounded/encircled with them, they called God faithful/loyal/devoted for Him (in) the religion: "If (E) you saved/rescued us from this, we will become (E) from the thankful/grateful."
So when He saved/rescued them, then they oppress/transgress/corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth without the right , you, you the people but your oppression/transgression (is) on yourselves the life the present's/worldly life's long life/enjoyment, then to Us (is) your return, so We inform you with what you were making/doing . 
But the life the present's/worldly life's example (is) as/like water, We descended it from the sky, so the Earth's/land's plant mixed/mingled with it, from what the people eat and the camels/livestock, until the earth/land took its decoration/beauty and it became decorated/beautified, and its people thought/assumed that they are capable/overpowering on it, (then) Our order/matter came to/destroyed it at night or (at) daytime, so We made it uprooted as though it did not enrich/be inhabited by the yesterday/previous day, as/like that We detail/explain/clarify the verses/evidences to a nation thinking.
And God, He calls to the safety's/security's/peace's home/house, and He guides whom He wills/wants to a straight/direct way/road.
To those who did good, the best/most beautiful/goodness and an increase (more), and no smoke/dust and nor humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses/oppresses their faces, those are the treed garden's/paradise's owners/company they are in it immortally/eternally .
And (to) those who gathered/acquired the sins/crimes (a) reimbursement (of) a sin/crime with similar/equal to it and humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses/oppresses them, none from (a) protector/shelterer (is) for them from (other than) God, as though their faces (are) covered/darkened (with) parts/portions (of) the darkened night. Those are the fire's owners/company , they are in it immortally/eternally .
And a day We gather them all/all together , then We say to those who shared/made partners (with God): "Your place/position, you and your partners (with God)." So We separated/dispersed between them, and their partners (with God) said: "You were not us worshipping."
So enough/sufficient with God (as) a witness/testifier between us and between you, if we were about your worshipping ignoring/neglecting (E).
At that place and time every self will find it is foolish what it advanced, and they were returned to God their owner/master the true , and what they were fabricating misguided/nullified from them.
Say: "Who provides for you from the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth? Or who owns/possesses the hearing/listening , and the eye sights/knowledge, and He brings out/emerges the live/alive from the dead, and He brings out/emerges the dead from the live/alive, and who plans/regulates the matter/affair?" So they will say: "God." so say: "So do you not fear and obey?"
So that one (is) God, your Lord the truth , so what after the truth (is there) except the misguidance, so how/where (do) you be sent away/diverted?
As/like that your Lord's word/expression became correct/true , on those who debauched , that they do not believe.
Say: "Are there from your partners (with God) who starts/initiates the creation then he repeats it?" Say: "God starts/initiates the creation, then He repeats it. So how/where (do) you lie/turn away?"
Say: "Are there from your partners (with God) who guides to the truth ?" Say: "God guides to the truth .Is who guides to the truth more worthy/deserving that He be followed or who does not guide except that he be guided, so what (is it) for you how you judge/rule?" 
And most of them do not follow except assumption/supposition , that the assumption/supposition does not suffice (replace) from the truth a thing, that God (is) knowledgeable with what they make/do.
And this the Koran was/is not that it be fabricated from (by) other than God, and but confirmation (of) what (is) between his (Prophet Mohammad's) hands, and detailing/explaining The Book , no doubt/suspicion in it, (it is) from the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
Or they say: "He fabricated it ." Say: "So come/bring with a chapter of the Koran similar/equal to it and call whom you were able from other than God, if you were truthful."
But they lied/denied/falsified with what they did not comprehend with its knowledge, and its interpretation/explanation did not come to them, as/like those from before them lied/denied/falsified, so look/see how the unjusts'/oppressives' end/turn was.
And from them who believed with it, and from them who does not believe with it, and your Lord (is) more knowledgeable with the corrupting .
And if they lied/denied you , so say: "For me (is) my deed, and for you (is) your deed, you are innocent/renouncing from what I make/do , and I am innocent/renouncing from what you make/do ."
And from them who listen/hear to you, so do you make the deaf hear/listen and (even) if they were not reasoning/understanding ?
And from them who looks to you, so do you guide the blind/confused and (even) if they were not seeing/understanding ?
That God, does not cause injustice/oppression (to) the people a thing and but the people themselves cause injustice/oppression.
And a day He gathers them as though they did not remain/wait except an hour from the daytime, getting to know each other, those who lied/denied with meeting God had lost, and they were not guided.
And either We show you some/part (of) which/that We promise them, or We make you die, so to Us (is) their return, then God (is) witnessing on what they make/do.
And to each/every nation/generation (is) a messenger, so if their messenger came, judgment was passed between them with the just/equitable, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
And they say: "When/at what time (is) that the promise if you were truthful?"
Say: "I do not own/possess to myself harm and nor benefit/usefulness except, what God willed/wanted, to every/each nation/generation (is) a term/time, if their term/time came, so they do not delay/lag behind an hour, and nor advance/precede ."
Say: "Did you see/understand if His torture came to you at night/suddenly at night/overnight or day time, what (do) the criminals/sinners hurry/rush/urge from Him?"
Is it then when (it) happened! (expression of wonderment) you believed with it/Him now, and you had been with it/Him hurrying/hastening .
Then (it) was said to those who caused injustice/oppression: "Taste/experience the immortality's/eternity's torture, are you being reimbursed except because (of) what you were gathering/acquiring ?
And they ask you to inform them: "Is it correct ?" Say: "Yes and (by) my Lord, that it truly is correct (E) , and you are not with disabling/frustrating."
And if to every self (that) caused injustice/oppression what is in the earth/Planet Earth, it would have ransomed/compensated with it, and they kept the regret/sorrow/remorse secret when they saw/understood the torture, and was passed judgment/ordered between them with the just/equitable, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
Is not to God what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, is not God's promise true , and but most of them do not know?
He revives/makes alive and He makes die, and to Him you are being returned.
You, you the people, a sermon/advice/warning had come to you from your Lord, and a cure/recovery to what (is) in the chests (innermosts), and guidance, and mercy to the believers.
Say: "With God's grace/favour and His mercy, so with that so they should be happy/rejoiced , He/it is better from what they gather/collect ."
Say: "Did you see/understand what God descended for you from provision so you made/created from it forbidden/prohibited and permitted/allowed?" Say: "Did God permit/allow for you, or on God you fabricate/cut and split?
And what (is in the) thought/assumption (on) the Resurrection Day (of) those who fabricate on God the lie/falsehood ? That God (is owner) of (E) grace/favour/blessing on the people, and but most of them do not thank/be grateful.
And you (do) not be in a matter/affair , and what you read/recite from it from Koran , and you do not make/do from deed(s) except (that) We were on you witnessing when you rush/hurry in it, and none from a weight (of) a smallest particle (smaller than an atom) in the earth/Planet Earth and nor in the sky/ space, and nor smaller/littler than that, and nor greater/magnified is far, hidden and distant from your Lord, except (it is) in an evident/clear Book .
Is it not that God's patrons/followers (that there is) no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving?
Those who believed and were fearing and obeying.
For them the good news in the life the present/the worldly life and in the end (other life), (there is) no exchange/replacement/substitution to God's words/expressions, that it is the winning/triumph , the great.
And (let) not their saying/word/opinion and belief to sadden you , that the glory/might (is) to God all/wholly , He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
Is it not that to God who (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth? And those who call from other than God partners, (they) do not follow (anything) except the assumption/supposition, and that they (are) except lying/speculating.
He is who made/created for you the night to be tranquil/quiet in it, and the daytime to see , that in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation hearing/listening. 
They said: "God took/received a child (son)." His praise/glory He is the rich, for Him what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, at you (is) no proof/evidence with that, are you saying on God what you do not know?
Say: "That those who fabricate/cut and split on God the lies/falsehood do not succeed/win."
Long life/enjoyment in the present world then to Us (is) their return, then We make them taste/experience the torture the strong (severe) because (of) what they were disbelieving.
And read/recite on them Noah's information/news, when he said to his nation: "You (my) nation, if my place/position and my reminding/mentioning with Gods' evidences/verses had become a burden on you, so on God I relied/depended , so gather/collect/unify your matter/affair and your partners (with God), then your matter/affair be not on you ambiguous/vague (covert) , then pass judgment/order to me, and do not give me time/delay me ."
So if you turned away, so I did not ask/demand (of) you from a reward/wage that my reward/wage (is) except on God, and I was ordered/commanded, that I be from the Moslems/submitters .
So they denied him , so We saved/rescued him and who (was) with him in the ship , and We made/put them (as) caliphs/successors and replacers/leaders, and We drowned/sunk those who lied/denied/falsified with Our evidences/verses , so look/see how was the end/turn (result of) the warned/given notice.
Then We sent from after him messengers to their nations, so they came to them with the evidences/verses , so they were not to believe with what they lied/denied/falsified with it from before, as/like that We stamp/cover/seal on the transgressors'/violators'/breakers' hearts/minds .
Then (E) We sent from after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his nobles/groups/assembly with Our verses/evidences , so they became arrogant and they were a nation (of) criminals/sinners .
So when the truth came to them from at Us, they said: "That truly (is) evident magic/sorcery (E)."
Moses Said: "Do you say to the truth when it came to you, is that magic/sorcery?" and the magicians/sorcerers do not succeed/win.
They said: "Did you come to us to turn us away (divert us) from what we found our fathers on it, and the arrogance/greatness be to you (B) in the earth/Planet Earth, and we are not to you (B) with believing."
And Pharaoh said: "Bring to me with every knowledgeable magician/sorcerer."
So when the magicians/sorcerers came, Moses Said: "Throw/throw away what you are throwing/throwing away."
So when they threw/threw away Moses said: "What the magic/sorcery you came with it, that truly God will waste/annul/cancel it, that truly God does not correct/repair (the) deeds (of) the corrupting."
And God corrects the truth with His words/expressions, and even if the criminals/sinners hated (it).
So did not believe in Moses except descendants from his nation on fear from Pharaoh and their nobles/groups/assembly that he (Pharaoh) tortures them , and that Pharaoh (is) high and mighty (E) in the earth/planet Earth, and that he (is) from (E) the spoilers/exceeders of the limit .
And Moses said: "You (my) nation if you had believed by God, so on Him rely/depend if you were Moslems/submitters ." 
So they said: "On God we relied/depended . Our Lord do not make/put us (as a) test to the nation the unjust/oppressors."
And save/rescue us with Your mercy from the nation the disbelievers.
And We inspired/transmitted to Moses and his brother that you (B) reside/establish houses/homes to your (B)'s nation by a city/border/region/Egypt, and make your houses/homes direction, and keep up the prayers, and announce good news (to) the believers.
And Moses said: "Our Lord, that You, You gave/brought Pharaoh and his nobles/assembly decoration/beauty/ornament and properties/possessions/wealth in the present world/worldly life, our Lord, to misguide (E) from Your way/path , our Lord wipe out/destroy on their properties/possessions/wealths and stamp/hit on their hearts/minds so they do not believe until they see the torture the painful."
He said: "Your (B)'s call/request/prayer had been answered/replied to, so be straight/direct, and do not follow (the) way/path (of) those who do not know."
And We crossed/passed/passed through with Israel's sons and daughters the sea , so Pharaoh and his soldiers/warriors followed them (with) transgression and violating/breaking until when the drowning/sinking caught up/overtook him , he said: "I believed that He is, no God except who Israel's descendants believed with Him, and I am from the Moslems/submitters ."
Now, and you had disobeyed before, and you were from the corrupting ?
So the day/today We save/rescue you with your body/top set (of) armor to be to who (is) behind you an evidence/sign , and that many from the people (are) from Our evidences/verses/signs ignoring/disregarding (E) .
And We had resided/settled to Israel's sons and daughters truthful residence/settlement , and We provided for them from the goodnesses , so they did not differ/disagree/dispute until the knowledge came to them, that your Lord passes judgment (settles) between them (in) the Resurrection Day in what they were in it differing/disagreeing/disputing.
So if you were in doubt/suspicion from what We descended to you, so ask/question those who read The Book from before you, the truth had come to you from your Lord, so do not be from the doubting/arguing.
And do not be from those who lied/denied/falsified with God's verses/evidences/signs, so you be from the losers .
That those who God's word/expression (was) deserved on them do not believe.
And even if every/each verse/evidence/sign came to them, until they see/understand the torture the painful.
So where it not for a village/urban city (that) believed, so its faith/belief benefited it, except Jonah's/Yonis' nation, when they believed We removed/uncovered (relieved) from them the shameful/scandalous/disgraceful torture in the present world/worldly life, and We gave them long life/made they enjoy to a time .
And if your Lord wanted/willed who is in the earth/Planet Earth all of them, all/all together would have believed (E), so do you compel/force the people until they be believers/believing?
And (it) was not to a self that she/it believes except with God's permission, and He makes/puts the obscenity/filth on those who do not reason/understand/comprehend.
Say: "Look/see , what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and the evidences/verses , and the warning/notices do not satisfy/suffice from a nation (that) do not believe."
So do they wait/watch (for) except as/like days/times (of) those who past/expired from before them, Say: "So wait/watch , that I am with you from the waiting/watching ."
Then We save/rescue Our messengers and those who believed, as/like that truthfully on Us We save/rescue the believers.
Say: "You, you the people, if you were in doubt/suspicion of/from my religion, so I do not worship those whom you worship from other than God, and but I worship God who makes you die, and I was ordered/commanded that I be from the believers."
And that stand/keep up your face/front/direction to the religion (as) a submitter/Unifier of God , and do not be from the sharers/takers of partners (with God) .
And do not call from other than God what does not benefit you and does not harm you, so if you made/did , so that you are then from the unjust/oppressors.
And if God touches you with harm, so (there is) no remover/uncoverer (reliever) to it except Him, and if He wants/wills/intends you with goodness/generosity , so (there is) no returner for His grace/favour/blessing, He strikes/hits with it whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves, and He is the forgiving, the merciful.
Say: "You, you the people, the truth had come to you from your Lord, so who was guided, so but he guides for his self, and who misguided , so but he misguides on it, and I am not on you with a guardian/protector."
And follow what is inspired/transmitted to you, and be patient until God judges/rules , and He is best (of) the judges/rulers.  
A L R , a Book its verses/evidences were perfected/tightened , then were detailed/explained/clarified from at/by (a) wise/judicious, expert/experienced .
That you not worship except God, that I am (E) to you from Him (a) warner/giver of notice, announcer of good news.
And that ask for forgiveness (from) your Lord then repent to Him, He gives you long life/makes you enjoy good/beautiful long life/enjoyment to a named/identified (specified) term/time, and He gives/brings each (owner) of grace/favour/blessing His grace/favour/blessing, and if they turned away, so that I, I fear on you a big/great day's torture.
To God (is) your return, and He is on every thing capable/able .
Is it not that they truly fold/bend/double/twist (hide) their chests (innermosts) to hide from Him? Is it not that when they cover/darken themselves (with) their clothes/garments/dresses, He knows what they keep secret and what they declare/publicize/announce? That He is knowledgeable of the chests (innermosts).
And (there is) none from a walker/creeper/crawler in the earth/Planet Earth except (that) on God (is) its provision, and He knows its settlement/establishment/affixation, and its depository/storage place , all (is) in (a) clear/explained Book .
And He is who created the skies/space and the earth, in six days/times, and His throne was/is on the water, to test you which of you (is) best/better (in) deed(s), and if (E) you said: "That you are being resurrected/revived from after the death/lifelessness." Those who disbelieved will say (E): "That, this (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery."
And if We delayed the punishment from them to a counted/numbered generation they will say (E) what prevents/withholds it ? Is it not (on that) day (when it) comes to them (it is) not diverted/sent away from them? And surrounded/encircled with them what they were with it mocking/making fun of.
And if (E) We made the human/mankind taste/experience from Us mercy, then We removed it from him, that he truly is (a) despairing/hopeless (E) (insistent) disbeliever/(insisting) disbelief.
And if (E) We made him taste/experience blessing/goodness after calamity/disastrous distress touched him, he will say (E): "The sins/crimes went away (were) eliminated/(were) wiped out from me." That he is happy/rejoiced/delighted proud/arrogant.
Except those who were patient, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds , those for them (is) a forgiveness and (a) big/great wage/reward .
So maybe/perhaps you are leaving some/part (of) what is inspired/transmitted to you, and narrowing/tightening with it your chest (innermost), that they say: "If only a treasure was descended on him, or (an) angel came with him." But you are (a) warner/giver of notice, and God (is) on every thing (a) guardian/protector .
Or they say: "He fabricated/cut and split it." Say: "So come or bring with ten chapters of the Koran similar/equal/alike to it fabricated , and call whom you were able from other than God if you were truthful."
So if they do not answer/reply to you, so know that (the Koran) was/is descended with God's knowledge , that (there is) no God except Him, so are you submitters/surrenderers/Moslems?"
Who was/is wanting the life the present/worldly life and its decoration/beauty/ornament, We fulfill/complete to them their deeds in it, and they in it are not being reduced/cheated/caused injustice to.
Those are those not (nothing is) for them in the end (other life) except the fire , and what they made/did (was) wasted/invalidated in it, and is being wasted/annulled/canceled what they were making/doing.
Is who was on an evidence from his Lord, and he reads/recites/follows it a witness/testifier from Him, and from before him/it Moses' Book a leader/clear road/an example and a mercy? Those believe with it, and who disbelieves from the groups/parties with Him/it, so the fire (is) his appointment/promise, so do not be in doubt from it, that it is the truth from your Lord, and but most of the people do not believe.
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated/cut and split on God lies/denials/falsifications? Those, they are being displayed/exhibited/shown on (to) their Lord, and the witnesses/testifiers (the angels) say: "Those (are) those who lied/denied/falsified on their Lord." Is not God's curse/torture on the unjust/oppressors?
Those who object/prevent/obstruct from God's way/path/sake , and they ask/wish/desire it (be) bent/crookedness/indirectness, and they, with the end (other life) they are disbelievers.
Those, were not (to) be disabling/frustrating in the earth/Planet Earth and (there) were not for them from other than God from guardians/allies , the torture (will) be doubled/multiplied for them, and they were not able (of) the hearing (to hear)/listening (to listen) , and they were not seeing/looking/understanding.
Those are those who lost themselves, and what they were fabricating/cutting and splitting (was) wasted/lost from them.
Undoutably/certainly that they (are) in the end (other life), they are the most losers.
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and they became humble/tranquil to their Lord, those are the Paradise's owners/company/friends, they are in it immortally/eternally .
The two groups'/parti es' example/proverb (is as) the blind, and the deaf, and the seeing , and the hearing , do they become (an) equal/alike example/proverb? So do you not mention/remember ?
And We had sent Noah to his nation: "That I am for you (an) evident/clear warner/giver of notice."
That do not worship except God, that I, I fear on you a painful day's torture.
So the nobles/groups/assembly those who disbelieved from his nation said: "We do not see you except (as) a human similar/equal/alike to us, and we do not see you (that) followed you except those who are our lowest/most despised, the opinion/belief (is) apparent, and we do not see for you on us from grace/favour/blessing, but we suspect you (are) liars/deniers/falsifiers."
He said: "You (my) nation, did you see/understand if I was on an evidence from my Lord, and He gave me mercy from at Him, so (it) was blinding/confusing on you, that do we oblige/compel it to you , and you are to it hating?" 
And you my nation, I do not ask/demand/beg you on it (for) property/possession/wealth, that my reward/wage is except on (from) God, and I am not with expelling/driving out those who believed, that they are receiving/meeting/finding their Lord, and but I only, I see/understand you (as) a nation being lowly/ignorant .
And you (my) nation, who gives me victory/aid from God, if I expelled/forced them out, so do you not mention/remember ?
And I do not say to you: 'At me (are) God's safes/storages (treasures), and I do not know the unseen/absent .'And I do not say: 'That I am (an) angel .' And I do not say to those who your eyes/sights despise/belittle : 'God will never/not give/bring them goodness .' God (is) more knowledgeable with what (is) in their selves, that I am then from (E) the unjust/oppressors.
They said: "You Noah, you had argued/disputed with us, so you increased arguing/disputing with us, so bring to us with what you promise us, if you were from the truthful."
He said: "But God brings with it to you, if He willed/wanted and you are not with disabling/frustrating."
And my advise does not benefit you, if I wanted/intended that I advise for you, if God was wanting/willing that He misguides/lures you, He is your Lord, and to Him you are being returned.
Or they say: "He fabricated/cut and split it." Say: "If I fabricated/cut and split it so on me (is) my criminality/committing (of) sins, and I am innocent/renouncing from what you commit a crime/sin."
And (it) was inspired/transmitted to Noah, that (none) will never/not believe from your nation except who had believed, so do not be miserable/fallen in hardship because (of) what they were making/doing .
And make/produce the ship/ships with Our eyes/sights, and Our inspiration/transmission , and do not address/converse with Me in those who caused injustice/oppression, that they are being drowned/sunken.
And he makes/produces the ship/ships, and whenever a group/assembly/nobles from his nation passed on (by) him, they humiliated/mocked from him, he said: "If you humiliate/mock from us, so (that) we are humiliating/mocking from you as you humiliate/mock ."
So you will/shall know whom torture comes (to) him (that) shames/scandalizes him , and continuing torture (be) placed on him/deserved (to) him.
Until when Our order/command came, and the hollow clay oven/furnace boiled over/gushed, We said: Carry/load/lift in it from every/each a pair/couple two, and your family/people/relation, except who the saying/words preceded on him, and who believed." And none believed with him except a little/few.
And he said: "Ride/embark/board in it, by God's name its channel/passage/course , and its anchor/landing , that my Lord (is) forgiving, merciful."
And it flows/orbits with them in waves/surges as the mountains and Noah called/cried (to) his son, and (while his son) he was in a separation/isolation : "You my son, ride/embark/board with us, and do not be with the disbelievers."
He said: "I will take shelter/refuge to a mountain (that) protects/shelters me from the water." He said: "(There is) no protector/shelterer today, from God's order/command except who He had mercy upon." And the waves/surges came in between/intervened between them (B), so he was from drowned/sunken.
And (it) was said: "You earth/Planet Earth/land swallow your water, and you sky/space cease/stop/clear up ."And the water reduced/receded , and the matter/affair/order/command was accomplished/carried out, and it straightened/leveled on the Joody , and was said: "Curse to the nation the unjust/oppressive."
And Noah called/cried (to) his Lord so he said: "My Lord, that my son (is) from my family , and that your promise (is) the truth , and you are most judicious (of) the judges/rulers."
He said: "You Noah, that he is not from your family/relation/people. That he is (a) not correct/righteous deed, so do not question/ask Me, what is not with knowledge to you with it (you have no knowledge of), that I advise you that you be from the lowly/ignorant ."
He said: "My Lord that I seek protection with You, that I ask/beg You what is not with me knowledge with it (I know nothing about), and unless You forgive for me and have mercy upon me, I will be from the losers ."
(It) was said: "You Noah, descend/enter with safety/security/peace from Us and blessings on you, and on nations from what/who (are) with you, and nations We will give them long life/make them enjoy, then painful torture from Us touches them."
Those are from the unseen information/news, We inspire/transmit it to you, you were not knowing it, you, and nor your nation from before, that, so be patient that the end (result is) to the fearing and obeying.
And to Aad, their brother Hoodan/Hood, he said: "You (my) nation, worship God (there is) not for you from a God other than Him, that you are except fabricators/cutters and splitters.
You (my) nation, I do not ask/beg you on it (from) a reward/wage/fee, that my reward/wage/fee (is) except on who created me , so do you not reason/understand ?
And you (my) nation, ask for forgiveness (from) your Lord then repent to Him, He sends the skies/space on you flowing/pouring abundantly, and He increases you strength/power to your strength/power , and do not turn away (as) criminals/sinners .
They said: "You Hood, you did not come to us with an evidence, and we are not with leaving our Gods from/on your saying/opinion and belief and We are not to you with believing."
That we say: 'Except some of our Gods afflicted you with bad/evil/harm.' He said: "I make God a witness/testifier, and witness/testify, that I am innocent/renouncing from what you share/make partners (with God)."
From other than Him, so plot/conspire against me all/all together, then you will not give me time/delay me.
That I relied/depended on God, my Lord and your Lord, (there is) not from a walker/creeper except He is taking with its forehead/foreheads' hair, that my Lord (is) on (a) straight/direct/balanced road/way .
So if they turned away, so I had communicated/informed you what I was sent with it to you, and my Lord makes a successor a nation other than you, and you do not harm Him a thing, that my Lord (is) on every thing (an) honest protector/observer ." 
And when Our order/command came, We saved/rescued Hoodan/Hood and those who believed with him, with mercy from Us, and We saved/rescued them from a strong torture.
And that is Aad, they disbelieved and denied with their Lord's evidences/verses and they disobeyed His messengers, and they followed every stubborn's/obstinant's tyrant's/rebels' order/command .
And they were followed in this the present world (by) curse/torture and the Resurrection Day, is not that Aad disbelieved (in) their Lord, is not destruction/death/curse to Aad, Hood's nation?
And to Thamud their brother Saleh, He said: "You (my) nation worship God, (there is) not for you from a God other than Him, He created you in the Earth , and He made you inhabit/populate in it, so ask Him for forgiveness, then repent to Him, that my Lord (is) near/close answering/replying."
They Said: "You Saleh, you had been between us promising/hoped for before this, do you forbid/prevent us that we worship what our fathers worship? And that we truly (are) in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from what you call us to it."
He said: "You (my) nation did you see/understand if I was on an evidence from my Lord, and He gave me from Him mercy, so who gives me victory/aid if I disobeyed Him, so you do not increase me except loss ?"
And you (my) nation this (is) God's female camel for you (as) an evidence/sign . So leave it eat in God's earth/ground/land and do not touch it with bad/evil/harm, so (then) near/close torture takes/punishes you.
So they wounded it/slaughtered it/cut it/made it infertile, so he said: "Enjoy three days in your home/country , that (is) a promise not denied/falsified."
So when Our promise came We saved/rescued Saleh and those who believed with him, with mercy from Us and from that days' shame/scandal/disgrace, that your Lord, He is the powerful/strong, the glorious/mighty .
And the loud strong cry/torture/raid took/punished those who caused injustice/oppression, so they became/became in the morning in their homes/countries stuck to the ground (dead).
As though they did not inhabit/enrich in it, is (it) not that Thamud disbelieved (in) their Lord, is not destruction/death/curse to Thamud?
And Our messengers had come (to) Abraham with the good news. They said: "Greeting/security/peace ." He said: "Greeting/security/peace ." So he did not stay/wait/remain (before) that (E) he came with a toasted/well done (m) calf.
So when he saw/understood their hands do not reach to it, he denied/did not recognize them , and he felt inner horror/fright fearfully/frightfully from them, they said: "Do not fear, that we, we were sent to Lot's nation."
And His woman (wife) standing , so she laughed/wondered, so We announced good news to her with Issac, and from behind Issac, Jacob.
She said: "Oh my calamity/scandal/misfortune , do I give birth and I am old/weak and that (is) my husband old aged , that, that (is) an unusual/strange thing (E)."
They said: "Are you wondering/astonished from God's order/command/matter/affair, God's mercy and His blessings on you people of the house/home, that He is praiseworthy/commendable, glorious/magnified ."
So when the fear/fright went away from Abraham, and the good news came to him, (he) argues/disputes with Us in Lot's nation.
That Abraham (was) clement/patient (E) groaner/moaner returning to God/repenting .
You Abraham, turn away from that, that it truly, your Lord's order/command had come, and that they, (a) torture (which is) not being returned, is coming to them.
And when Our messengers came (to) Lot, he felt bad/evil/harm because of them and he was impatient with them (became uptight) , and he said: "This (is a) very hot (difficult) day."
And his nation came to him rushing disturbedly/hysterically/madly to him, and from before they were making/doing the sins/crimes, he said: "You (my) nation those are my daughters, they are (F) purer for you, so fear and obey God and do not shame/scandalize/disgrace me in (front of) my guests, is (there) not from you a correctly/rightly guided man?"
They said: "You had (E) known (there) is not for us from (a) right in your daughters, and that you know (E) what we want."
He said: "If that for me (is) on you power/strength, or I take shelter to a strong corner/strong support."
They said: "You Lot that we (are) your Lord's messengers, they will never/not reach to you, so move/travel with your family/relation/people with parts/portions from the night, and no one of you turns around except your woman (wife), that it what struck/hit/marked them is striking/hitting/marking her, that their appointment (is) the morning/day break, is not the morning/daybreak with near/close?"
So when Our order/command came, We made its high/elevated, its lowest/bottom (up side down) and We rained on it stones of dry and hardened mud neatly piled over each other .
Marked/identified at your Lord and it is not with far/distant from the unjust/oppressors .
And to Madyan/Madya (We sent) their brother Shu'aib, he said: "You (my) nation, worship God (there is) not for you from a God other than Him, and do not reduce/decrease the measuring/weighing device , and the scale/weight , that I see/understand you with goodness , and that I, I fear on you a surrounding's/encircling's day's torture."
And you (my) nation fulfill/complete the measuring/weighing device and the scale/weight with the just/equitable, and do not reduce/cheat the people (of) their things, and do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth disordering/corrupting .
God's remainder/remnant/rest (is) best for you if you were believing, and I am not with a protector/observer on you."
They said: "You Shu'aib, do your prayers order/command you that we leave/discard what our fathers worship, or that we do with our properties/wealths/possessions what we want, that you, you are (E) the clement , the correctly/rightly guided."
He said: "You (my) nation, did you see/understand if I were on an evidence from my Lord, and He provided for me from Him a good/beautiful provision , and I do not want that I differ/disagree with you to what I forbid/prevented you from it, that truly I want (nothing) except the correction/repair/reconciliation what I was able (to do), and my success/inspiration is except by God, on Him I relied/depended , and to Him I repent/obey ."
And you (my) nation (let) not my defiance/animosity (to you) make you commit a crime/sin that strikes you (with) similar (to) what stuck Noah's nation, or Hood's nation, or Saleh's nation, and Lot's nation is not with far/distant from you.
And ask for forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to Him, that my Lord (is) merciful, loving/affectionate.
They said: "You Shu'aib, we do not understand/know much (from) what you say, and that we, we see/understand you (E) (are) in us weak, and where it not for your tribe/group, we would have stoned you, and you are not with a dear on us."
He said: "You (my) nation, is my tribe/group dearer to you than God, and you took Him behind you forgotten behind the back? That my Lord (is) with what you make/do surrounding ."
And you (my) nation, make/do on your capacity/place/position, that I am making/doing/working, you will/shall know who comes to him torture (that) shames/scandalizes/disgraces him, and who he is lying/denying , and observe/watch that I am with you (an) observer/watcher ."
And when Our order/command came, We saved/rescued Shu'aib and those who believed with him with mercy from Us, and the loud strong cry/torture raid took/punished those who caused injustice/oppression, so they became/became in the morning in their homes/countries struck to the ground (dead).
As though they did no inhabit/enrich in it, is not (a) destruction/death/curse to Madyan, as Thamud was destroyed/dead/cursed?
And We had sent Moses with Our evidences/signs and (an) evident proof/evidence .
To Pharaoh and his nobles/group/assembly, so they followed Pharaoh's order/command, and Pharaoh's order/command is not with (the) correct/right guidance.
He precedes/goes before his nation (on) the Resurrection Day, so He made them approach/near the fire ,and how bad (is) the army/thirst , the targeted/neared ?
And they were followed in this (by) curse/torture and (on) the Resurrection Day, how bad (is) the giving/support , the given/(desired) support ?
That (is) from the villages'/urban cities' information/news, We narrate/relay it on (to) you, from it (there are villages) standing and harvested/uprooted .
And We did not cause injustice/oppression to them, and but they caused injustice/oppression (to) themselves, so their gods which they call from other than God did not enrich/satisfy from a thing from them (their gods did not help them in any way or thing), when your Lord's order/command came, and they did not increase them other than destruction/loss.
And as/like that (is) your Lord's punishing , if/when He took/punished the villages/urban cities, and (while) it is unjust/oppressive , that His punishing (is) strong (severe).
That in this (is) a sign/evidence (E) to who feared the end's/other life's torture, that (is) a day/time the people (are) being gathered/collected to Him/it, and that (is) a witnessed day .
And We do not delay it, except a term/time counted/prepared. 
(When that) day comes, a self does not speak/talk except with His permission, so from them (are people) miserable/unhappy and happy/fortunate.
So but those who were miserable/unhappy, so (they are) in the fire , for them in it (is) deep exhalation and loud inhalation .
Immortally/eternally in it as long as the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth continued/lasted, except what your Lord willed/wanted, that your Lord (is a) maker/doer, to what He wills/wants.
And but those who were made happy/fortunate, so (they are) in the Paradise, immortally/eternally in it, as long as the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth continued/lasted, except what your Lord willed/wanted, a gift/grant not cut/broken (interrupted).
So do not be in doubt from what those worship, they do not worship except as their fathers worship(ed) from before, and that We are fulfilling/completing their share/fortune , not reduced/decreased .
And We had given/brought Moses The Book , so it was differed/disputed in it, and were it not for a word/expression (that) preceded from your Lord, (it) would have ended/accomplished (settled) (E) between them, and that they are in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from it.
And that your Lord then, will fulfill/complete for them (E) each/every (one's) deeds, that He (is) with what they make/do an expert/experienced.
So be straight/direct as you were ordered/commanded, and who repented with you, and do not tyrannize/exceed the limit, that He (is) with what you make/do seeing .
And do not lean towards to those who caused injustice/oppression, so the fire touches you, and (there are) no guardians/allies for you from other than God, then you (will) not be given victory/aid.
And keep up the prayers to (the) ends/edges (of) the daytime (to) parts from the night from the night; that the goodnesses wipe off/eliminate the sins/crimes, that (is) a remembrance/reminder to the praising/glorifying .
And be patient, so then God does not waste/loose/destroy the good doers' reward/wage .
So where it not for (owners) of a remainder/remnant , from the generations/centuries from before you, (who were) forbidding/preventing from the corruption in the earth/Planet Earth, except a few from whom We saved/rescued from them; and those who caused injustice/oppression followed what they were luxuriated ungrateful and arrogant in it, and they were criminals/sinners .
And your Lord was not to destroy the villages/urban cities with injustice/oppression and its people (are) correcting/repairing .
And if your Lord willed/wanted He would have made the people one nation, and they still/continue differing/disagreeing .
Except who your Lord had mercy upon and for that He created them, and your Lord's word/expression (is) completed: "I will fill (E) Hell from the Jinns and the people all together."
And all (every thing) We narrate/inform on (to) you from the messengers' information/news, what We strengthen with it your heart , and in this came to you the truth and a sermon/advise/warning, and a remembrance/reminder to the believers.
And say to those who do not believe: "Make/do/work on your capacity/place/position, We are making/doing working."
And wait/expect/watch, We are waiting/expecting/watching.
And to God (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's unseen/surpernatural , and to Him the matter/affair all of it is returned, so worship Him, and rely/depend on Him, and your Lord is not with ignoring/neglecting/disregarding from what you make/do
A L R those (are) verses/evidences (of) The Book , the clear/evident .
That We descended it an Arabic Koran , maybe/perhaps you reason/comprehend
We narrate/inform on (to) you the narration's/information's (true stories') best, with what We inspired/transmitted to you, this the Koran , and if you were from before it from (E) the ignoring/neglecting
When Joseph said to his father: You my father that I, I saw eleven planet(s)/star(s) and the sun and the moon, I saw/them to me prostrating."
You, my son, do not relay/inform your dream on (to) your brothers, so they conspire/plot to you a plot/conspiracy , that the devil (is) to the human/mankind a clean/evident enemy.
And as/like that your Lord chooses/purifies you and teaches/informs you from the information's/speech's interpretation/explanation, and He completes His blessing on you, and on Jacob's family, as/like He completed it on your fathers (forefathers) before, Abraham, and Isaac, that your Lord (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
In Joseph and his brothers (there) had been signs/evidences to the askers/questioners .
When they said: "Joseph (E), and his brother, (are) more lovable/likable to our father than us, and we (are) a group/band/company, that truly our father (is) in (E) clear/evident misguidance."
Kill/fight Joseph or throw him/cast him away (to) a land , your father's face becomes free/alone for you, and you be from after it a correct/righteous nation.
A speaker from them said: "Do not kill/fight Joseph, and (but) throw him/throw him away in the well's/deep well's low hidden area/grave, some (of) the caravan unintentionally finds and picks him up, if you were making/doing."
They said: "You, our father, why for you (that) you do not trust/entrust us on Joseph, and that we (are) to him faithful/sincere (E)?"
Send him with us tomorrow (in the) future, he eats, drinks and plays and he plays/amuses , and that we are for him protectors/safe keepers (E).
He said: "That I (it) saddens me (E) that you go away with him, and I fear that the wolf eats him, and (while) you are from him ignoring/neglecting/disregarding."
They said: "If (E) the wolf ate him, and we are a group/band/company, that we are then losers (E)."
So when they went/went away with him, and they all unanimously agreed that they put him in the well's/deep well's low hidden area/grave, and We inspired/transmitted to him: "You will inform them (E) with their matter/affair, this, and (while) they are not feeling/knowing/sensing."
And they came (to) their father (at) evening/first darkness/dinnertime weeping .
They said: "You our father, that we went/went away racing and we left Joseph at ourbelongings/effects/goods, so the wolf ate him, and you are not with believing to us, and even if we were truthful."
And they came on his shirt/dress with blood falsified , he said: "But your selves enticed/lured for you a matter/affair/order/command, so graceful patience, and God (is) the seeked help/support from on what you describe/categorize."
And a caravan came, so they sent their brave/tall (scout/waterboy), so he lowered/dropped his bucket/pail, he said: "Oh good news, that (is) a boy/slave ." And they kept him secret (as) goods/merchandise, and God (is) knowledgeable with what they make/do .
And they bought him with a reduced/unjust price, counted/numbered silver coins , and they were in him from the indifferent/uninterested .
And said who bought him from (the) city/border/region/Egypt to/for his woman (wife): "Be generous/kind (in) his home/residence , perhaps he benefits us, or we take him (as) a child (son)." And like that, We highly positioned/secured to Joseph in the earth/Planet Earth, and to teach/instruct him from interpreting/explaining the information/speeches , and God (is) defeater/conqueror on His order/command/matter/affair, and but most (of) the people do not know.
And when he reached his maturity/strength, We gave/brought him judgment/rule and knowledge, and as/like that We reward the good doers.
And who (F) he is in her house/home seduced/enticed him from himself, and she closed/shut the doors/entrances, and said: "Come/come here ." He said: "I seek protection (of) God, that He is my Lord, He did good/beautified my residence/home , that He does not make the unjust/oppressive succeed/win."
And she had been intended/resolved with him, and he intended/resolved with her, where it not for that he saw/understood his Lord's proof/evidence, and like that to send away/divert from him the bad/evil/harm and the enormous/atrocious deeds , that he truly is from Our worshippers/slaves, the faithful/loyal/devoted.
And they (B) raced each other (to) the door/entrance, and she ripped/cut his shirt/dress from (the) back/end and they (B) found her master/ruler/leader at/by/near the door/entrance she said: "What (is the) reward/reimbursement (of) who willed/wanted bad/evil/harm with your family/people except that he be imprisoned or painful torture?"
He said: "She seduced/enticed me from myself." And a witness/testifier from her family/relation/people witnessed/testified: "If his shirt/dress was ripped/cut from (the) front , so she was truthful and he we was from the liars/falsifiers .
And if his shirt/dress was ripped/cut from (the) back/end, so she lied/falsified and he is from the truthful.
So when he saw his shirt/dress (was) ripped/cut from (the) back/end, he said: "That it is from your (F) plotting/conspiring that your (F) plotting/conspiring (is) great."
Joseph object/turn away from that, and (to her) ask for forgiveness (F) for your crime (F), that you (F) were (F) from the sinners/mistaken .
And women in the city/town said: "Elaziz/the Egyptian ruler's woman (wife) seduces/entices her youth/slave/servant from himself, he had affected her deeply/deeply impassioned her lovingly , that we see/understand her (E) in evident misguidance."
So when she heard with their (F) cheating/deceit , she sent to them (F), and she prepared for them (F) a recliner/support/cushion and she gave/brought each one (F) from them (F) a knife and said: "Get out/appear/emerge on them." So when they saw him, they (F) greatened/exalted/revered him, and they (F) cut off/cut to pieces/amputated their (F) hands, and they said: "Remoteness to God that (is) not a human, that this (is) except (an) honoured/kind/noble angel/owner/possessor ."
She said: "So that (is) what you blamed/reprimanded me in him, and I had seduced/enticed him from himself so he held fast/protected himself from evil , and if (E) he does not make/do what I order/command him, he will be imprisoned (E) and (he) will be (E) from the lowly/humiliated ."
He said: "My Lord, the prison/jail (is) more likable to me from what they call me to it, and unless you divert from me their conspiring I incline to (give up) to them (F), and I be from the lowly/ignorant ."
So his Lord answered/replied to him, so He diverted from him their (F) conspiring , that He truly is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
Then it appeared to them from after what they saw/understood the evidences/signs they imprison him (E) until a time .
And two youths/adolescents entered with him the prison/jail, one of them (B) said: "That I , I see myself, I press/squeeze an intoxicant ." And the other said: "That I, I see myself, I carry/bear over my head bread, the birds eat from it, inform us with its interpretation/explanation, that we see/understand you (are) from the good doers."
He said: "Feeding/food does not come to you (B) (which) you will be provided with it except I informed you with its interpretation/explanation, before (it) comes to you, that is what from what my Lord taught/instructed me , that I left a nation's religion/faith (that) do not believe with/by God, and they are, with the end (other life), they are disbelieving."
And I followed my father's/forefather's, Abraham's and Isaac's and Jacob's faith/religion, (it) was not for us that we share/make partners with God from a thing, that is from God's grace on us, and on the people, and but most of the people do not thank/be grateful.
You my two companions/friends (of) the prison/jail, are separate Lords better or God the one, the defeater/conqueror ?
You do not worship from other than Him except names you named it, you and your fathers/forefathers, God did not descend with it from a proof/evidence , that the judgment/rule (is) except to God, He ordered/commanded that you not worship except (only) Him that (is) the religion the straight , and but most of the people do not know.
You my two companions/friends (of) the prison/jail, but, one of you (B) so he gives drink an intoxicant (to) his lord, and but the other, so he be crucified/placed on a cross , so the birds eat from his head, the matter/affair which in it you (B) ask for an opinion/clarification was passed judgmen t/ordered (resolved) .
And he said to whom he thought/assumed that he is saved from them (B): "Mention me at your lord." So the devil made him forget, his lords' reminder , so he stayed/waited in the prison/jail (a) few/some (between  - ) years.
And the king said: "I see seven fat/fleshy cows, seven weak/bony/starved eat them (F), and seven green ears/spikes of wheat, barley etc. and others dry. You, you the nobles/groups/assembly give me your opinion/clarify for me in my dream, if you were to the dream(s) explaining (interpreting)."
They said: "A confused mixture (of) dreams, and we are not with interpreting/explaining the dreams with knowing."
And who was saved/rescued from them (B) and he remembered after a generation (and said): "I inform you with its interpretation/explanation, so send me."
Joseph, you the always very truthful, give us your opinion/clarify for us in seven fat/fleshy cows, seven weak/bony/starved eat them (F), and seven green ears/spikes of wheat, barley etc. and others dry, maybe/perhaps I return to the people, maybe/perhaps they know.
He said: "You sow/seed/plant seven years habitually/consistently, so what you harvested/gathered, so leave it in its ear/spike (of corn, barley etc.), except little from what you eat."
Then comes from after that seven (years) strong (severe), they eat what you advanced (stored) for them, except little from what you preserve .
Then comes from after that, a year in it the people be rained upon, and in it they press/squeeze.
And the king said: "Come with him to me (bring him)." So when the messenger came to him , he said: "Return to your Lord, so ask/question him, what (is) the women's affair/condition/ thought which cut off/amputated their (F) hands, that my Lord (is) with their plotting/conspiring knowledgeable."
He said: "What (is) your matter/affair/concern when you (P/F) seduced/enticed Joseph from himself." They said: "Remoteness to God , we did not know from (of) bad/evil/harm on him." Elaziz's/the Egyptian ruler's woman (wife) said: "Now the truth appeared , I seduced/enticed him from himself, and that he is from (E) the truthful."
That (it is) to him to know that I, I did not betray/become unfaithful to him with the unseen/hidden and that God does not guide the betrayer's/unfaithful's plot/conspiracy .
And I do not acquit myself, that the self (is) incessantly commanding/urging (E) with the bad/evil/harm, except what my Lord had mercy upon, that my Lord (is) forgiving, merciful.
And the king said: "Come with him to me (bring him), I choose/select him to myself." So when he conversed/spoke to him , he said: "That you are today near us , highly positioned , faithful/loyal ."
He said: "Make/put me on the land's/Earth's safe's/storages (treasures), that I am (an) honest protector/guard knowledgeable."
And as/like that We highly positioned to Joseph in the land/Earth he establishes/resides from it when/where he wills/wants, We strike/mark with Our mercy whom We will/want, and We do not loose/waste/destroy the good doers reward .
And the ends' (other life's) reward (E) (is) better to those who believed and were fearing and obeying.
And Joseph's brothers/brethren came, so they entered on him, so he knew them, and they are to him ignorant (not recognizing).
And when he outfitted them with their preparation/equipment (goods) , he said: "Come to me with a brother to you from your father, do you not see/understand, that I, I fulfill/complete the measuring/weighing device, and I am best of the senders of the descenders (hosts)?"
So if you did not come to me with him so (there is) no measurement/weight for you at me, and do not approach/near me.
They said: "We will entice/solicit from him his father, and we are making/doing (E)."
And he said to his youths/servants : "Put their goods/merchandise in their packsaddles, maybe/perhaps they know (recognize) it when they returned to their family/people , maybe/perhaps they return."
So when they returned to their father, they said: "You our father, the measuring/weighing device (the goods) was prevented/prohibited from (for) us, so send with us our brother, we take (goods) by measure/weight, we are for him protectors/guards (E) ."
He said: "Do I, I entrust you on him, except as I entrusted you on his brother from before? So God (is the) best protector , and he (is) most merciful (of) the merciful."
And when they opened their belongings/goods they found their goods/merchandise returned to them, they said: "You our father, we do not ask/desire , this (is) our goods/merchandise returned to us, and we bring food and supplies (to) our family/people , and we protect our brother, and we be increased a (transport) camel's weight , that (is) easy weight ."
He said: "I will never/not send him with you until you give me a promise/covenant from God to bring him to me (E) except that be (except if you are) surrounded/maneuvered to outsmart with you." So when they gave him their promise/covenant, he said: "God (is) on what we say (a) guardian/trustee ."
And he said: "You my sons, do not enter from one door/entrance, and enter from separate doors/entrances, and I do not suffice/enrich from you from God from a thing, that the judgment/rule (is) except to God, on Him (E) I relied/depended , and on Him so should rely/depend the reliant/dependent .
And when they entered from where their father ordered/commanded them, and (it) was not to suffice/enrich from them from God from a thing, except a need/necessity in Jacob's self he accomplished it, and that truly he is (an owner) of knowledge to what We taught/instructed him , and but most of the people do not know.
And when they entered on Joseph, he gave shelter/refuge (hosted) his brother to him, he said: "That I, I am your brother, so do not be miserable because (of) what they were making/doing ."
So when he prepared/outfitted/(supplied) them with their preparation/equipment (supplies), he put the cup in his brother's packsaddle, then an announcer/informer, announced/informed: "You, the caravan ,that you are stealing/robbing (E)." 
They said, and they approached/came on (to) them: "What (are) you losing/missing ?"
They said: "We miss/fail to find the king's cup , and to who (E) came with it a (transport) camel's load , and I am with it a leader/grantor."
They said: "By God, you had known we did not come to corrupt in the land/Earth and we were not stealing/robbing."
They said: "So what (is) his reward if you were lying/denying ?"
They said: "His reward whom (it) is found in his packsaddle, so it is his reward ." As/like that We reimburse the unjust/oppressive.
So he began with their bags/containers , before his brother's bag/container , then he brought it out from his brother's bag/container, as/like that, We plotted/conspired to Joseph, he was not to take his brother in the king's religion/domain , except that God wills/wants, We raise whom We will/want stages/degrees , and above each (owner) of knowledge (is more) knowledgeable.
They said: "If he steals/robs, so a brother to him had stolen/robbed from before." So Joseph kept it secret in himself, and did not show it to them, he said: "You are a worse position , and God (is) more knowledgeable with what you describe/categorize."
They said: "You, you Elaziz/Egyptian ruler, that to him (is) an old aged big father, so take/receive any of us (in) his place/position, that we, we see you from the good doers."
He said: "I seek protection (of) God, that we take except whom we found our belongings/effects/goods at him then we are unjust/oppressive (E) ."
So when they despaired from him, they cleared secretly conversing, their oldest said: "Did you not know that your father, had taken on you a promise/covenant from God and from before what you abused/exceeded the limit in (on) Joseph, so I will never/not leave/depart the land until my father permits/allows for me, or God judges/rules for me, and he (is) best (of) the judges/rulers."
Return to your father so say: 'You, our father, that your son stole/robbed, and we did not witness/testify except with what we knew, and we were not to the unseen observing/guarding .'
'And ask/question the village/urban city which we were in it, and the caravan which we came in it, and we are, truthful (E).'
He (their father) said: "But your selves enticed/tolerated for you an order/command/matter/affair, so graceful patience, perhaps God that (He) brings them to me all together, that He (is) the knowledgeable, the wise/judicious ."
And he turned away from them, and he said: "Oh my sorrow, on Joseph," and his two eyes whitened, from the sadness/grief, and he is suppressed .
They said: "By God you still remember/mention Joseph until you be sick and weak/diminished or you be from the perishing/dying ."
He said: "But I complain my grief/condition and my sadness/grief to God and I know from God what you do not know." 
You my sons go so feel/seek information from Joseph and his brother, and do not despair from God's happiness/rest/mercy , that it truly is no (one) despairs from God's happiness/rest/mercy except the nation the disbelieving. (NOTE: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AND , REFER TO THE DICTIONARY)
So when they entered on (to) him, they said: "You, you Elaziz/Egyptian ruler, the harm touched us and our family and we came with little/poor or bad goods/merchandise, so fulfill/complete for us the measuring/weighing device and give charity on us, that God rewards the charity givers."
He said: "Did you know what you made/did with Joseph and his brother, when you are lowly/ignorant ?"
They said: "Are you, you are (E) Joseph?" He said: "I am Joseph and that (is) my brother, God had blessed on us, that who, whom fears and obeys, and is patient, so that God does not loose/waste/destroy the good doer's reward ."
They said: "By God, God had preferred/chosen you over us and that truly we were sinners (E)."
He said: "No blaming/reproaching on you today , God forgives for you, and He (is) most merciful (of) the merciful."
Go with my shirt/dress, this, so throw it on my father's face/front he comes (becomes) seeing/understanding , and bring me with your family/people all/all together.
And when the caravan parted/went out , their father said: "That I, I find (E) Joseph's smell , unless you prove me wrong ."
They said: "By God, that you are in your misguidance the old/old time."
So when that the announcer of good news came, he threw it (the shirt) on his face/front , so he returned seeing/understanding , he said: "Did I not say to you that I know from God what you do not know?"
They said: "You, our father ask for forgiveness for us for our crimes, that we were sinners/mistaken/erroneous ."
He said: "I will/shall ask for forgiveness for you from my Lord, that he is the forgiving, the merciful."
So when they entered on Joseph, he gave shelter/refuge (hosted) his parents to him, and he said: "Enter (the) city/border/region/Egypt , if God willed/wanted safe/secure."
And he rose his parents on the throne and they fell down to him prostrating, and he said: "You my father, that (is the) interpretation/explanation (of) my dream from before, my Lord had made it truthfully , and He had done good/bettered with me when He brought me out from the prison/jail, and He came with you from the desert from after that the devil spoiled between me and between my brothers, that my Lord (is) kind/soothing to what He wills/wants, that He is the knowledgeable, the wise/judicious.
My Lord, you had given me from the possession and free will and you taught/instructed me from interpreting/explaining the information/speeches , creator/bringer to being (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, you are my guardian in the present world and the end (other life), make me die a Moslem/submitter , and make me catch up/join me with the correct/righteous.
That (is) from the unseen's/hidden's information/news, We inspire/transmit it to you, and you were not by/near them when they all unanimously agreed their matter/affair, and (while) they are cheating/deceiving/scheming.
And most of the people are not with believing, and even if you held onto stingily and desired strongly (were careful).
And you do not ask/question them on (for) it from a reward/wage/fee, that it is except (a) reminder to the creations all together/(universes).
And how many from an evidence/sign/verse in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, they pass on (to) it, and they are from it objecting/opposing .
And most of them do not believe with God, unless and (while) they are sharing/taking partners (with Him).
Did they become safe that (a) cover/disaster from God's torture comes to them, or the Hour/Resurrection comes to them suddenly/unexpectedly and (while) they do not feel/know/sense?
Say: "This (is) my way/path I call to God, on (an) evidence/clear sightedness, me and who followed me, and praise/glory (to) God, and I am not from the sharers/takers of partners (with God)."
And We did not send from before you except men We inspire/transmit to them from (about) the villages'/urban cities' people/relation , did they not walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth, so they see/wonder about how was (the) end/turn (result of) those who (were) from before them, and the end's (other life's) home/house (E) (is) best to those who feared and obeyed, so do you not reason/understand/comprehend?
Until when the messengers despaired , and they thought/assumed that they had been lied to/denied, Our victory/aid came to them, so We save/rescue whom We will/want, and Our courage/might/power does not be returned from the nation the criminals/sinners.
In their narration/information (stories there) had been an example/warning to those of the pure minds/hearts (it) was not an information/speech to be fabricated and but confirmation (to) which (is) between his hands and detailing/explaining/clarifying every thing, and guidance, and mercy to (a) nation believing.  
A L M R , those are The Book's verses/evidences and which was descended to you, from your Lord the truth , and but most of the people do not believe.
God (is) who raised the skies/space without pillars/posts/columns (that) you see/understand it, then He aimed to/tended to/sat on on the throne , and He manipulated/subjugated the sun and the moon each passes/orbits to a named/identified (specified) term/time, He plans/regulates the order/command/matter/affair, He details/explains/clarifies the verses/evidences , maybe/perhaps you, with meeting your Lord, you be sure/certain.

And if you be astonished, so their saying/opinion and belief (is a) wonderment/astonishment/ surprise: "Is it that if we were dust/earth are we (to be) in (E) (a) new creation ?" Those are those who disbelieved with their Lord, and those, the leather or iron collars or handcuffs (will be) in their necks, and those are the fire's owners/company/friends, they are in it immortally/eternally .
And they hurry/hasten you with the sin/crime (harm) before the good/goodness, and the punishments and tortures had passed from before them, and that your Lord (is owner) of mercy to the people, on (for) their injustice/oppression, and that your Lord (is) strong (E) (severe in) the punishment.

And to God, prostrate what (are) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth voluntarily and involuntarily/forcefully , and their shadow/glory at the early morning and the evening to sunsets.

Say: "So did you take/receive from other than Him guardians/allies they do not own/possess to themselves benefit/usefulness and nor harm?" Say: "Do the blind and the seeing become equal/alike?

Is whom, He is taking care of on every self with what it earned/gained , and they made/created to God partners, say: "Name/identify them, or you inform Him with what He does not know in the earth/Planet Earth, or with apparent/visible from the saying/opinion and belief . Rather their cheatery/deceit was decorated/beautified to those who disbelieved, and they prevented/obstructed from the way/path , and whom God misguides so (there is) none from (a) guide (is) for him.
For them (is) torture in the life the present/worldly life, and the end's (other life's) torture (E) (is) harder/more difficult , and (there is) none from (a) protector/preserver for them.
(The) example/proverb (of) a treed garden/paradise which the fearing and obeying were promised (it), (is) the rivers/waterways flows/passes from below/beneath it , its fruits (are) continuous/lasting, and its shade.

And We had sent messengers from before you and We made for them spouses and descendants. And (it) was not to a messenger that he comes with a verse/evidence except with God's permission, to every term/time (is) a judgment/fate .

And We did not send from a messenger except with his nation's tongue/language , to clarify/explain to them, so God misguides whom He wills/wants, and He guides whom He wills/wants, and He is the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
And We had sent Moses with Our signs/evidences/verses: "That bring out your nation from the darknesses to the light, and remind them with God's days/times that in that (are) evidences/verses to every patient/endurer, thankful/grateful."
And when Moses said to his nation: "Remember/mention God's blessing/goodness on you, when He saved/rescued you from Pharaoh's family, they impose upon you the torture's harm/evil , and they slaughter your sons and they shame your women, and in that is a great test from your Lord.
And when your Lord announced/informed if (E) you thanked/became grateful, I will increase you (E), and if (E) you disbelieved that My torture (is) strong (E) (severe).
And Moses said: "If you disbelieve you and who (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all together, so then God (is) rich (E) praiseworthy/commendable."
Did not information/news (of) those from before you come to you, nation (of) Noah and Aad and Thamud and those from after them? No (one) knows them except God, their messengers came to them with the evidences, so they returned their hands in their mouths (they bit their fingers from anger), and they said: "We have disbelieved with what you were sent with it, and we are in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from what you call us to it."
Their messenger said: "Is (there) doubt/suspicion in God, creator/bringer to being (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, He calls you to forgive for you from your crimes, and He delays you to (a) named/identified term/time?" They said: "That you are except humans similar/equal to us, you want/intend that you prevent/obstruct us from what our fathers were worshipping, so come to us/bring to us with a clear/evident proof/evidence ."
Their messengers said to them: "That we are except humans similar/equal to you, and but God blesses on whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves, and (it) was not for us that we come to you with a proof/evidence , except with God's permission , and on God so should the believers rely/depend ."
And why not for us that we not, rely/depend on God, and He had guided us (to) our ways/paths , and we will be patient (E) on what you harmed us mildly (with it), and on God so should rely/depend the reliant/dependent .
And those who disbelieved said to their messengers: "We will bring/drive you (E) out from our land/Earth, or you return (E) in (to) our religion/faith." So their Lord inspired/transmitted to them: "We will make die/destroy (E) the unjust/oppressors."
And We will make you reside/inhabit (E) the land/Earth from after them, that (is) to who feared My place/position, and feared My threat.
And they seeked victory/judgment , and every stubborn/obstinate tyrant/rebel failed/despaired .
From behind him (is) Hell , and he be given drink from pussy water .
He swallows it little by little and (he) is not about to accept its taste/swallow it easily, and the death/lifelessness comes to him from every place/position, and he is not with dying, and from behind him (is) strong/rough torture.
(The) example/proverb (of) those who disbelieved with their Lord, their deeds (are) like ashes, the wind strengthened in a stormy/violent day, they do (can) not be capable/able on a thing from what they gained/acquired , that (is) the misguidance , the distant/far.
Do you not see/understand that God created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth , if He wills/wants He eliminates you and comes with a new creation?
And that is not with a powerful/undefeatable on God.
And they emerged/appeared to God all together , so the weak said to those who were arrogant: "That we, we were for you following, so are you sufficing/availing (helping) from us from (against) God's torture from a thing?" They said: "If God guided us, we would have guided you, (it is) equal on (to) us if we became grievous worried and impatient or we were patient, (there is) none from an escape/diversion for us."
And the devil said when the matter/affair/order/command was passed/judged : "That God promised you, the truth's promise, and I promised you, so I broke the promise to you, and (there) was not from a power/control to me on you except that I called you, so you answered/replied to me, so do not blame/reprimand me and blame/reprimand yourselves, I am not with aiding you (a savior), and you are not with aiding me, that I disbelieved with what you made me a partner (with God) from before. That the unjust/oppressive, for them (is) a painful torture."
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds were made to enter treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it immortally/eternally in it, with their Lord's permission , their greeting in it (is): "A security/peace ."
Do you not see/understand how God gave an example/proverb, (of) a good/pure word/expression ,as a good/pure tree, its root (is) affirmed/established (fixed) and its branch/top (is) in the sky?
It gives/brings its food/fruits every period of time with its Lord's permission , and God gives the example/proverbs to the people, perhaps they mention/remember. 
And (the) example/proverb (of) a bad/spoiled word/expression (is) as a bad/spoiled tree, (it) was uprooted/cut down from above the ground , no bottom (root is) for it.
God affirms/strengthens those who believed with the word/opinion and belief the affirmed/strengthened in the life the present/worldly life and the end (other life), and God misguides the unjust/oppressive, and God makes/does what He wills/wants.
Do you not see/understand to those who exchanged/substituted God's blessing/goodness (by) disbelief, and they placed their nation (in) the destruction's/failure's home/place ?
Hell , they roast/suffer/burn (from) it, and how bad (is) the settlement/establishment ?
And they made/put to God equals (idols) to misguide from His way/path , say: "Live long/enjoy so that your end/destination (is) to the fire ."
Say to My worshippers/slaves those who believed: "They (should) keep up the prayers and spend from what We provided for them secretly and publicly from before that a day comes, (where there is) no selling/trading in it and nor differences in opinions/friendships .
God is who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He descended from the sky water so He brought out with it from the fruits a provision for you, and He manipulated for you the ships to flow/pass/orbit in the sea/river/ocean with His order/command, and He manipulated for you the rivers/waterways.
And He manipulated for you the sun and the moon consistently/dedicated (B) , and He manipulated for you the night and the daytime.
And He gave you from every (thing) what you asked/begged Him (for it), and if you count God's blessing/goodness , you do not count/compute it , that the human/mankind (is an) unjust/oppressive (E), (insistent) disbeliever.
And when Abraham Said: "My Lord make that, the country/land safe/secure, and distance me/make me avoid and my sons and daughters that we worship the idols ."
My Lord that they (F) truly misguided (F) many from the people, so who followed me, so that he truly is from me, and who disobeyed me, so that You are forgiving, merciful.
Our Lord, that I resided/inhabited from my descendants at a valley of no plants/crops at Your House/Home, the Forbidden/Respected/Sacred. Our Lord to stand/keep up the prayers, so make hearts from the people fall/drop to them, and provide for them, from the fruits, perhaps they thank/be grateful.
Our Lord, You know what we hide, and what we declare/publicize , and (there is) not from a thing (that) hides from God in the earth/Planet Earth and nor in the sky/space.
The praise/gratitude , (is) to God who granted to me on (in) the old age Ishmael and Isaac, that my Lord (is) hearing/listening (to) the call/prayer .
My Lord make me continuing/keeping up the prayers, and from my descendants, our Lord, and accept my call/prayer .
Our Lord forgive for me and to my parents and to the believers, (on) the Account Day/Resurrection Day starts . 
And do not think/suppose that God (is) ignoring/neglecting from what the unjust/oppressive make/do , but God delays them to a day the eye sights/knowledge stare/gaze in it.
Humiliated/humble raising their heads humiliated and humbly, their eyes/eye lids do not return to them, and their hearts (are) emptiness .
And warn/give notice, on a day the torture comes to them, so those who were unjust/oppressive say: "Our Lord delay us to a near/close term/time, we answer/reply (to) your call/request , and we follow the messengers." Did you not be sworn/made oath (swear/make oath) from before (that there is) none from vanishment/termination for you?
And you resided in those who were unjust/oppressive (to) themselves' residences, and how We made/did with them was clarified/shown for you, and We gave to you the examples/proverbs.
And they had cheated/deceived/schemed their cheatery/deceit/schemes, and at God (is) their cheatery/deceit/schemes, and if their cheating/deceit/schemes (was to make) the mountains vanish/terminate (E) from it .
So do not think/suppose (E) , (that) God (is) breaking His promise (to) His messengers, that God (is) glorious/mighty , (capable) of revenge/punishment.
A day the earth/Planet Earth be exchanged/substituted instead (of) the earth/Planet Earth, and the skies/space, and they emerged/appeared (went out) to God the one, the defeater/conqueror .
And you see/understand the criminals/sinners (on) that day tied to each other in the ties/shackles/chains .
Their shirts/clothes (are) from oily fluid from some trees (tar), and the fire covers/darkens their faces/fronts.
(So) God rewards/reimburses (E) each self what (it) gained/acquired , that God (is) fast (in) the account/calculation.
That (is) information/communication to the people, and to be warned/given notice with it, and to know that He is a one God, and (to owners) of the pure minds/hearts to remember/mention/praise/glorify. 
A L R , those are The Book's evidences/verses , and (an) evident/clear Koran .
Maybe those who disbelieved wish/love if they were Moslems/submitters/surrenderers.
Leave them eat and they live long/enjoy, and the hope distracts/preoccupies them , so they will/shall know.
And We did not destroy from a village/urban city , except and for it (is) a known Book .
None from a nation precedes its term/time, and they do not delay (it).
And they said: "You, you who the reminder/remembrance was descended on him, that you are mad/insane (E)."
If you (could) come to us with the angels , if you were from truthful! (expression of wonderment).
We do not descend the angels except with the truth , and they (the disbelievers) were not then delayed/waited .
That We, We descended the reminder/remembrance, and that We (are) for it, protectors/guards (E) .
And We had descended from before you in the first's/beginner's groups/parties .
And none from a messenger comes to them , except they were with him mocking/making fun.
As/like that We enter/insert it in the criminals'/sinners' hearts/minds .
They do not believe with it, and (the) manner/nature (of) the firsts/beginners had past/expired .
And if We opened on them a door/entrance from the sky/space, so they continued/remained in it ascending/zigzagging.
They would have said: "But our eye/sights/understanding got closed and confused, but we are a bewitched/enchanted nation."
And We had made/created in the sky/space constellations, and We decorated/beautified it to the lookers/seers .
And We protected/guarded it from every cursed/expelled devil.
Except who eavesdropped the hearing, so a clear/evident light from a fire source/a star followed him.
And the earth/Planet Earth, We extended/spread it, and We threw in it anchors/mountains , and We sprouted/grew in it from every thing weighed/measured/balanced.
And We made/created for you in it livelihoods/sustenances, and whom you are not to him with providing for.
And that (there is not) from a thing, except at Us (is) its safes (treasures) , and We do not descent it except with (a) known measure/quantity .
And We sent the winds/breezes (as) pollinators , so We descended from the sky water, so We gave it to you to drink, and you are not for it with storing.
And that We, We are (E), We revive/make life and We make die, and We are the heirs/inheritants.
And We had known the advanced from you, and We had known the delayed/lagging behind.
And that your Lord, He gathers them, that He is wise/judicious, knowledgeable.
And We had created the human/mankind from black (foul mud) dry mud/clay smoothened/rotted .
And the Jinn , We created him from before from (the) fire's burning wind .
When/if your Lord said to the angels : "That I am creating (a) human/humans from black (foul mud) dry mud/clay smoothened/rotted ."
So when/if I straightened him, and I blew in him from My Soul/Sprit , so fall/land/come to him prostrating.
So the angels all/all together prostrated.
Except Satan/Iblis , refused/hated that he be with the prostrating.
He said: "You Satan , why (is it) for you (that) you not be with the prostrating?"
He said: "I was not to prostrate to (a) human You created him from black (foul mud) from dry mud/clay smoothened/rotted ."
He said: "So get out from it, so that you are cursed/expelled."
And that on you (is) the curse/torture to the Judgment's Day/Resurrection Day .
He said: "My Lord, so delay me to a day they be sent/resurrected/revived."
He said: "So that (then) you are from the delayed ."
To (the) day of the time, the known.
He said: "My Lord with what You misguided/enticed me , I will decorate/beautify for them in the earth/Planet Earth, and I will misguide/entice them (E) all/all together."
Except Your worshippers/slaves from them, the faithful/loyal/devoted.
He said: "That (is) a straight/direct road/way on Me."
That My worshippers/slaves, power/control is not for you on them (you have no power/control over My worshippers/slaves) except who followed you from the misguided/failed .
And that Hell (is) their appointment (E) all/all together.
For it (are) seven doors/entrances, to each door/entrance from them (is an) apportioned/divided part/portion.
That the fearing and obeying (are) in treed gardens/paradises and water springs/wells.
Enter it with safety/security/peace, safe/secure.
And We removed/pulled away what (is) in their chests (innermosts) from hatred/animosity , brothers on beds/sofas facing each other.
Hardship/fatigue does not touch them in it, and they are not with being brought out from it.
Inform My worshippers/slaves, that I, I am the forgiving , the merciful .
And that My torture, it is the torture, the painful.
And inform them about Abraham's guests.
When/if they entered on (to) him, so they said: "Greeting/peace ." He said: "That we are afraid/apprehensive from you."
They said: "Do not be afraid/apprehensive, that we, we announce good news to you with (of) a knowledgeable boy (new son)."
He said: "Did you announce good news to me on that the old age touched me so with what (do) you announce good news to me?"
They said: "We announced to you with the good news, so do not be from the despaired/despairing."
He said: "And who despairs from his Lord's mercy, except the misguided?"
He said: "So what (is) your matter/affair/concern, you, the messengers?"
They said: "We are sent to a nation (of) criminals/sinners ."
Except Lot's family, We are saving/rescuing them (E) all together .
Except his woman (wife). We predestined/evaluated that she truly is from (E) the remaining behind.
So when the messengers came (to) Lot's family .
He said: "That you are a disguised/unknown nation."
They said: "But we came to you, with what they were in it doubting/arguing."
And we came/brought (to) you with the truth , and that we are truthful (E).
So move/travel/depart at night with your family/people with portions from the night and follow their backs/ends; and no one from you (should) turn around , and proceed/complete where/when you are being ordered/commanded.
And We ordered/passed judgment to him (of) that the matter/affair/order/command, that those (people's) root/remainder (is) cut off/severed by the morning/daybreak.
And the city's/town's people came cheerful/rejoicing ."
He said: "That those (are) my guests, so do not expose my faults (scandalize me)."
And fear and obey God and do not shame/disgrace me .
They said: "And did we not forbid/prevent you from the creations all together/(universes)?"
He said: "Those (are) my daughters, if you were making/doing."
To your life/age (an oath) that they truly are in (E) their intoxication/loss of judgment being confused/puzzled .
So the loud strong cry/torture raid took/punished them at sunrise.
So We made its highest/elevated , its lowest/bottom, and We rained on them stones of dry and hardened mud.
That in that (are) evidences/signs (E) , to the observing/scrutinizing .
And that it truly is with a continuing/keeping up path/means (E) .
That in that (is) a sign/evidence (E) to the believers.
And if owners/company (of) the thicket/dense tangled trees were unjust/oppressive (E).
So We revenged from them that they (B) truly (the two nations) are with a clear/evident leader/example (E) .
And the forbidden's/mind's owners/company denied the messengers.
And We gave/brought them Our verses/evidences , so they were objecting/opposing/turning away from it.
And they were carving out/cutting from the mountains houses/homes safely/securely.
So the loud strong cry/torture raid took/punished them in the morning/daybreak.  
So what they were gaining/acquiring did not enrich/suffice them from them (was of no benefit to them).
And We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) except with the truth , and that truly the Hour/Resurrection is coming (E) so forgive/pardon the forgiveness/pardon, the beautiful/graceful .
That truly your Lord (is) the creator (E), the knowledgeable.
And We had given/brought you seven from the doubles/strength/capacity and the Koran , the great.
Do not extend/spread your two eyes to what We made spouses/couples from them enjoy with it, and do not be sad/grievous on (for) them, and be lenient/comforting/lower your wing/side (kindness) to the believers.
And say: "That I, I am the warner/giver of notice, the clear/evident ."
As We descended on the apportioners/dividers/distributors.
Those who made the Koran bits/divisions/enchantments .
So by/with your Lord, We will ask/question them (E) all together .
About what they were making/doing .
So uncover/declare openly with what you are being ordered/commanded, and turn away from the sharers/takers of partners (with God).
That We truly make you sufficient (protect you) against the mocking/making fun.
Those who create/put with God another god, so they will/shall know.
And We had know (known) that you, your chest (innermost) narrows/tightens becuase (of) what they say.
So praise/glorify with your Lord's praise/gratitude/thanks, and be from the prostrating.
And worship your Lord, until the assurance/certainty (death) comes to you.  
God's order/command came so do not hurry/rush/hasten Him , His praise/glory and (He is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified about what they share/make partners (with God).
He descends the angels with the Soul/Spirit from His order/command on whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves, that warn/give notice, that He is, no God except Me, so fear and obey Me.
He created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth, (He is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified from what they share/make partners (with God).
He created the human/mankind from a drop/male's or female's secretion/little water, so then he (the human/mankind) is (a) clear/evident disputer/adversary .
And the camels/livestock, He created it for you, in it (is) warmth, and benefits/uses, and from it, you eat.
And for you in it (is) beauty/grace/loveliness when/where you come or go in the evening/rest , and when/where you go out/depart freely .
And it loads/carries your loads/belonging (weights) to a country/land , you were not reaching it, except with the selves' difficulty/hardship, that your Lord (is) merciful/compassionate (E), merciful.
And the horses and the mules and the donkeys, (are) to ride it and decoration/beauty , and He creates what you do not know.
And on God (is) the path's/way's objective/direction , and from it, (there is) unjust/deviation , and if He willed/wanted He would have guided you all together .
He is who descended from the sky water , for you from it (is) a drink, and from it (are) trees in it you graze/put (to) pasture .
He sprouts/grows for you with it the plants/crops and the olives and the palm trees and the grapes, and from all the fruits, that in that (is) a sign/evidence (E) to a nation thinking.
And He manipulated/subjugated for you, the night , and the daytime and the sun , and the moon , and the stars/planets (are) manipulated/subjugated with His order/command, that in that (are) signs/evidences (E) , to a nation reasoning/understanding.
And what He created/seeded for you in the earth its colours (are) different, that in that (is) an evidence/sign (E) to a nation mentioning/remembering .
And He is who manipulated/subjugated the sea/ocean to eat from it soft/tender meat , and you bring out from it a jewel/ornament you wear/dress it, and you see the ships audibly cutting/shearing in it, and to wish/desire from His grace/favour, and maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
And He threw in the earth/Planet Earth anchors/mountains that (E) it sways and leans/moves and unsettles with you, and rivers/waterways and ways/paths , maybe/perhaps you be guided.
And signs/identification marks, and with the star/planets, they be guided.
Is who creates as/like who does not create, so do you not mention/remember ?
And if you count God's blessing/goodness you do not compute it , that God (is) forgiving (E), merciful.
And God knows what you keep secret and what you publicize/announce .
And those whom they call from other than God, they do not create a thing, and they, they are being created.
Deads other than alive, and they do not feel/know/sense when they are being sent/resurrected/revived.
Your God (is) one God, so those who do not believe with the end (other life), their hearts/minds (are) defiant of God and His orders/obscene , and they are arrogant.
Undoutably/surely that God knows what they keep secret and what they publicize/announce , that He does not love/like the arrogant.
And if (it) was said to them: "What (did) your Lord descend?" They said: "The firsts'/beginners' myths/baseless stories ."
To carry/burden their sins/burdens complete (on) the Resurrection Day, and from the sins/burdens (of) those who they misguide them without knowledge. Is it not bad/evil/harmful what they sin/carry/bear ?
Those from before them had cheated/deceived/schemed, so God came (and) destroyed their buildings/structures from the foundations/bases, so the roof/ceiling fell down on them from above them, and the torture came to them from where/when they do not feel/know/sense.
Then (on) the Resurrection Day He shames/scandalizes/disgraces them, and he says: "Where (are) my partners those who you were making animosity/revolting/disobe ying in (because of) them?" Those who were given the knowledge said: "That the shame/scandal/disgrace, today , and the bad/evil/harm (is) on the disbelievers."
Those who the angels make them die, (while) unjust/oppressive (to) themselves, so they threw the submission/surrender (and said): "We were not making/doing/working from the bad/evil/harm/corruption." Yes/certainly that God (is) knowledgeable with what you were making/doing/working.
So enter Hell's doors/entrances, immortally/eternally in it, so how bad (E) (is) the arrogant's home/dwelling ?
And (it) was said to those who feared and obeyed: "What (did) your Lord descend?" They said: "Goodness/honour to those who did good in this the present world a goodness, and the house/home (of) the last (other life is) best , and blessed/praised (E) (is) the fearing and obeying's house/home."
Treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, they enter it, the rivers/waterways flows/runs from below/beneath it , for them in it what they will/want, as/like that God reimburses the fearing and obeying.
Those whom the angels make them die pure , they say: "A greeting/peace/security on you, enter the Paradise because (of) what you were making/doing/working."
Do they wait/watch except that the angels or your Lord's order/command comes ? As/like that those from before them made/did, and God did not cause injustice/oppression to them, and but they were themselves causing injustice/oppression.
So sins/crimes (of) what they made/did struck/hit them , and what they were with it mocking/making fun (of) surrounded/afflicted with them.
And those who shared/made partners (with God) said: "If God willed/wanted, we would not have worshipped from other than Him from a thing, us and nor our fathers, and nor forbade/prohibited from other than Him from a thing." As/like that those from before them made/did, so is there on the messengers except the information/communication the clear/evident ?
And We had sent in every nation a messenger: "That worship God and avoid/distance (yourselves from) the every thing worshipped other than God/idols ." So from them who God guided, and from them who the misguidance became certain/deserved on him, so walk/move in the earth/Planet Earth, so see/wonder about how was the liars'/deniers' end/turn (result).
If you held onto stingily and desire strongly (are careful) on their guidance, so that God does not guide who misguides, and none from victoriors/saviors (are) for them.
And they swore/made oath by God their rights'/oaths' utmost , (that) God does not send/resurrect/revive who dies, yes/certainly a promise on Him truth , and but most of the people do not know.
To clarify/show/explain for them what they differ/disagree/dispute in it, and (for) those who disbelieved to know that they were lying/denying/falsifying.
Truly/indeed Our saying/word to a thing if We willed/wanted/intended it (is) that We say to it: "Be." So it becomes.
And those who emigrated in (to) God from after what they were caused injustice to/oppressed, We return/reestablish them (E) in the present world a goodness, and the end's (other life's) reward/wage (E) (is) greater/bigger , if they were knowing.
Those who were patient, and on their Lord they rely/depend/surrender to .
And We did not send from before you except men , We inspire/transmit to them, so ask/question the reminder's/remembrance's people , if you were not knowing.
With the evidences and The Books, and We descended to you the reminder/remembrance to clarify/show/explain to the people what was descended to them, and maybe/perhaps they think.
Did those who cheated/deceived/schemed the sins/crimes trust that God sinks down with them the earth/Planet Earth, or the torture comes to them from where/when they do not feel/know/sense?
Or He takes/receives/punishes them in their turning/returning so they are not with disabling/frustrating?
Or He takes/receives/punishes them on fear/fright, so that your Lord (is) merciful/compassionate (E), merciful.
Did they not see/understand, to what God created from a thing (that) its shades/shadows turns/follows from the right and the lefts, prostrating to God and (while) they are degraded/humiliated ?
And to God prostrates what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth from a walker/creeper/crawler , and the angels , and they are not being arrogant.
They fear their Lord from above them, and they make/do what they are ordered/commanded.
And God Said: "Do not take two gods two, but/truly/indeed, He is one God, so (only) Me, so be awed/monkish/monastic of Me .
And to Him what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and to Him (is) the permanent/continuous/lasting religion, so is other than God you fear and obey? 
And what (is) with you from a blessing/goodness , so (it) is from God, then if the harm touched you, so to Him you pray/cry aloud and humbly.
Then if He removed/uncovered/(relieved) the harm from you, then a group/party from you, they share/make partners with their Lord.
To disbelieve with what We gave/brought them, so live long/enjoy, so you will/shall know.
And they make/create/put to what they do not know a share from what We provided for them. By God you will be asked/questioned about what you were fabricating/cutting and splitting.
And they make/create/put to God the daughters, His praise/glory, and for them what they lust/desire/crave.
And if any of them was announced good news to with the female, his face became/remained blackened, and he is holding (his) breath/suppressed .
He hides/conceals from the nation from (the) bad/evil/harm (of) what he was announced good news to with it, does he hold/grasp/cling to it on disgrace/weakness , or he buries/hides/conceals it in the dust/earth? Is (it) not bad/evil what they judge/rule?
To those who do not believe with the end (other life) the bads'/evil's example/proverb, and to God the example/proverb the highest/mightiest , and He is the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious.
And if God punishes the people because of their injustice/oppression, He would not (have) left on it from a walker/creeper/crawler , and but He delays them to a named/identified term/time, so if their term/time came, they do not delay/lag behind an hour, and they do not advance/precede (an hour).
And they make/create/put to God what they hate, and their tongues/speeches describes/categorizes the lies/falsehood , that to them (is) the best/most beautiful , undoutably/certainly that to them (is) the fire , and that they truly are neglected/wasted/hastened .
By God, We had sent to nations from before you, so the devil decorated/beautified for them their deeds, so he is their guardian/ally today, and for them (is) a painful torture.
And We did not descend on you The Book except to clarify/show/explain to them what they differed/disagreed/disputed in it, and guidance and mercy to a nation believing.
And God descended from the sky water, so He revived with it the land/Earth after its death/lifelessness, that in that (is) an evidence/sign (E) to a nation listening/hearing .
And that for you in the camels/livestock (is) an example (E) , We make you drink from what (is) in its bellies/insides, clear/pure milk pleasant tasting to the drinking, from between fully and partially digested food/feces and blood.
And from the palm trees' and the grapes' fruits you take from it intoxication , and a good/beautiful provision , that in that (is) an evidence/sign (E) to a nation reasoning/understanding .
And your Lord inspired/signaled to the bees, that take from the mountains homes , and from the trees, and from what they raise and support/hold onto .
Then eat from all the fruits, so enter/pass your Lord's roads/paths manipulated/dangled low, from its bellies/insides emerges/appears a drink its colours (are) different, in it (is) a cure/healing for the people; that in that (is) an evidence/sign (E) to a nation thinking.
And God created you, then He makes you die, and from you who is returned to the lifetime's worst/meanest/despised, so that (he) not know after knowledge a thing, that your Lord (is) knowledgeable, capable .
And God preferred/favoured some of you over some in the provision , so those who were preferred/favoured are not with returning their provision on (to) what their rights/oaths owned/possessed, so they are in it equal/alike . So are they with Gods' blessing/goodness disbelieving and denying ?
And God made/created for you from yourselves spouses , and He made/created for you from your spouses sons/sons and daughters, and sons of your sons , and He provided for you from the goodnesses . Is it with the falsehood they believe, and with Gods' blessing/goodness they disbelieve?
And they worship from other than God what does not own/possess for them a provision/rain a thing from the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and they are not able.
So do not give the examples/proverbs to God, that God knows and you do not know.
God gave an example , an owned slave/human , he is not capable/able on (of) a thing, and whom what We provided for him from Us a good/beautiful provision , so he spends from it secretly and publicly , do they become equal/alike? The praise/gratitude (is) to God, but most of them do not know.
And God gave an example (of) two men, one of them (B) is mute, he is not capable/able on (of) a thing, and he is tired/weak (tiresome/burdensome) on (to) his master/friend/owner wherever he aims/turns him, he does not come/bring with goodness , does he become equal/alike, he and who orders/commands with the justice/equality and he is on a straight/direct/balanced road/way?
And to God (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's unseen/invisible ; and the Hour's/Resurrection's order/command/matter/affair is not except as the eye sights'/knowledges' twinkling/quick glance or it is nearer/closer, that God (is) on every thing capable/able .
And God brought you out from your mothers' bellies/insides, you do not know a thing, and He made/created for you the sense of hearing , and the eye sights/knowledge, and the hearts/could be minds, maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
Do they not see (look) to the birds subjugated/manipulated in the sky's atmosphere/air? None holds/grasps them except God, that in that (are) signs/evidences (E) to a nation believing.
And God made/created/put for you from your houses/homes tranquillity/security/residence, and He made/created/put for you from the camels'/livestock's skins houses/homes you find it light (during the) day/time (of) your moving/departure/travel , and (the) day/time (of) your residency, and from its wool/animal hair , and its hair/wool (fur/down) , and its hair/fur home effects/woven wool and enjoyment/effects/goods to a time .
And God made/created/put for you from what He created shades, and He made/created/put for you from the mountains covers/shelters/homes, and He made/created/put for you shirts/clothes (that) protects you (from) the heat, and shirts/clothes (that) protects you (from) your hardship in war, as/like that/that is how He completes His blessing on you, maybe/perhaps you submit/surrender.
So if they turned away, so but on you (is) the information/communication, the clear/evident .
They know God's blessing , then they deny it, and most of them (are) the disbelievers.
And a day/time We send/resurrect/revive from every nation a witness/testifier, then (it will) not be allowed/permitted to those who disbelieved, and nor they be allowed to offer reconciliation/appeasement.
And if those who caused injustice/oppression saw/understood the torture, so (it) does not be reduced/lightened from them, and nor they be given time/looked at .
And if those who shared/made partners (with God) saw their partners (with God), they said: "Our Lord, those (are) our partners (with You), those whom we were calling from other than You." So they threw the saying/word/opinion and belief that you (are) lying/denying/falsifying (E).
And they threw to God (on) that day/time the submission/surrender , and what they were fabricating/cutting and splitting (was) wasted/nullified/lost from them.
Those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from Gods' way/path , We increased them torture over/on the torture, because (of) what they were corrupting/disordering .
And a day/time, We send/resurrect/revive in every nation/generation a witness/testifier on them from themselves, and We came with you (as) a witness/testifier on those, and We descended on you The Book (a) clarification/explanation to every thing, and guidance, and mercy, and a good news to the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers.
That God orders/commands with the justice/equality and the goodness, and giving/bringing (to) of the relations/near, and (God) forbids/prevents from the enormous/atrocious deeds , and the defiance of God and His orders/obscenity , and the oppression/transgression , He preaches to/advises/warns you, maybe/perhaps you mention/remember .
And fulfill/complete with God's promise/contract if you promised/pledged , and do not break/destroy the faith/belief after its confirmation/assurance , and you had made/put God on you (as) a sponsor/supporter , that God knows what you make/do.
And do no be like who unbound/broke/destroyed her yarn/spun thread (into) unraveling/fraying/untwisted strands of yarn from after (its) strength , you take your rights/oaths (as) deceit/blemishes between you, that (E) a nation be more grown/increased than a nation, but/truly God tests you with it, and to clarify/show/explain for you (on) the Resurrection Day what you were in it differing/disagreeing/disputing.
And if God wanted/willed He would have made/created you one nation/generation , and but God misguides whom He wills/wants, and He guides whom He wills/wants, and you will be asked/questioned (E) about what you were making/doing.
And do not take your rights/oaths (as) deceit/blemishes between you, so (a) foot/foothold in goodness and knowledge slips/falls/sins after its steadfastness/stability/strength , and you taste/experience the bad/evil/harm because (of) what you prevented/obstructed from God's way/path , and for you (is) a great torture.
And do not buy/volunteer with Gods' promise/pledge a small/little price, but/truly (what is) at God, it is best for you, if you were knowing.
What (is) at you depletes/exhausts , and what (is) at God (is) remaining/lasting/continuing, and We will reimburse (E) those who were patient their reward with (the) best (of) what they were making/doing.
Who made/did correct/righteous deeds from a male or a female, and he is believing, so We will make him live a good life , and We will reward them (E) , their reward/wage/fee with (the) best (of) what they making/doing.
So if you read the Koran so seek protection by God from (against) the devil, the cursed/expelled.
That He, (there) is not for him power/control on those who believed and on their Lord they rely/trust/surrender to.
But his power/control (is) on those who follow him, and those whom (are) with him, (they are) sharing/taking partners (as gods).
And if We exchanged/replaced/substituted a verse in place (of) a verse , and God is more knowledgeable with what He descends, they said: "But you are a fabricator/cutter and splitter." Rather most of them do not know.
Say: "The Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Sprit descended it from your Lord with the truth to affirm/strengthen those who believed, and guidance, and a good news to the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers."
And We have known that they say: "But/indeed a human teaches/instructs him, (the) tongue/language/speech (of) those who deviate, insult and defame to Him, non-Arabic/Persian (tongue/language/speech), and this (is) an Arabic clear/evident tongue/language/speech.
That those who do not believe with God's verses/evidences/signs, God does not guide them, and for them (is) a painful torture.
But/indeed (who) fabricates/cuts and splits the lies/defiance/falsehood (are) those who do not believe with God's verses/evidences , and those, they are liars/deniers/falsifiers.
Who disbelieved with God after his faith/believing , except who was compelled/forced, and his heart/mind (is) assured/tranquillised/secured with the faith/belief, and but who delighted/expanded his chest (innermost) to the disbelief, so on them anger from God and for them (is) a great torture.
That (is) because they (E), they loved/liked the life the present world/worldly life more/over the end (other life), and that God does not guide the nation, the disbelieving.
Those are those who God stamped/closed/sealed on their hearts/minds , and their hearing/sense of hearing , and their eye sights/understanding, and those, they are the ignoring/neglecting/disregarding.
Certainly/undoutably that they, in the end (other life), they are the losers/misguided and perished.
Then that your Lord to those who emigrated from after what they were misled/betrayed , then they struggled/did (their) utmost and were patient, that your Lord (is) from after it forgiving (E), merciful.
A day every self comes to argue/dispute about (for) her/its self, and every self be fulfilled/completed what it made/did/worked, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed. 
And God gave an example/proverb (of) a village/urban city (that) was safe/secure assured/tranquillised/secured, its provision comes to it easily/comfortably from every place, so it disbelieved with Gods' blessings/goodnesses , so God made it taste/experience the starvation's/hunger's cover/dress/mixture and the fear/fright, because (of) what they were making/producing/manufacturing.
And a messenger from them had come to them so they denied him , so the torture took/punished them , and (while) they are unjust/oppressive.
So eat from what God provided for you permitted/allowed/good/pure and thank/be grateful (for) God's blessing/goodness , if you were (only) Him worshipping.
Truly/indeed He forbade/prohibited on you the dead, and the blood, and the pigs'/swine's flesh/meat, and what was declared to other than God with it, so who was forced not (intending) transgressing/corrupting and nor transgressing/violating , so that God (is) forgiving, merciful.
And do not say to what your tongues/languages/speeches describes/categorizes the lies/defiance/falsehood, that (is) permitted/allowed, and that (is) forbidden ." To fabricate/cut and split on (about) God the lies/denials/falsehood: "That those who fabricate/cut and split on (about) God the lies/denials/falsehood do not succeed/win.
Little long life/enjoyment and for them (is) a painful torture.
And on those who repented/guided/Jews We forbade/prohibited what We narrated/relayed/informed on (to) you from before, and We did not cause injustice to/oppress them, and but they were themselves causing injustice to/oppressing.
Then that your Lord to those who made/did bad/evil/harm with ignorance/foolishness, then they repented from after that, and they corrected/repaired , that your Lord (is) from after it forgiving (E), merciful.
That Abraham was a nation/constitution/(set example) (he) was obeying humbly/holding the prayer to God, a submitter/Moslem/Unifier of God, and (he) was not from the sharers/takers of partners (with God).

And We gave/brought him in the present world goodness, and that he truly (is) in the end (other life) (is) from (E) the correct/righteous.
Then We inspired/transmitted to you that follow Abraham's religion/faith, (he was) a submitter/Moslem/Unifier of God and (he) was not from the sharers/takers of partners (with God).
But/indeed the Saturday/Sabbath was put/made on those who differed/disagreed/disputed in it, and that truly your Lord judges/rules (E) between them (on) the Resurrection Day in what they were in it differing/disagreeing/disputing.
Call to your Lord's way/path with the wisdom, and the good sermon/advise/warning, and argue/dispute with them with which it is best , that your Lord He is more knowledgeable with (of) who misguided from His path/way , and He is more knowledgeable with the guided.
And if you punished/rewarded, so punish with similar/equal (to) what you were punished with it, and if (E) you were patient it (E) (is) best to the patient.

And We gave/brought Moses The Book, and We made it guidance to Israel's sons and daughters; that you do not take from other than Me a guardian/protector .
Descendants (of) whom We carried/loaded with Noah, that he truly was a thankful/grateful worshipper/slave.
And We informed/carried out/completed to Israel's sons and daughters in The Book/destiny/term ,(that) you will corrupt/disorder (E) in the earth/Planet Earth twice, and you will become high and mighty (E) great height, might and dignity.
So if their (B)'s first/beginning (of the two times) came, We sent on (to) you worshippers/slaves for Us of strong (severe) power/mighty, so they went through/corrupting/destroying in between and around the homes/houses , and (it) was a made/done promise.
Then We returned to you the repeat/second time/repetition over them, and We extended/spread you with properties/possessions/wealths, and sons/sons and daughters, and We made you more (a larger) supportive tribe/family/group.
If you did good, you did good for yourselves, and if you did bad/evil/harm so for it (your selves), so if the last's/end's/other's promise came, they will cause God evil/harm (to) your faces/fronts, they will enter the Mosque like they entered it (on) the first/beginning time , and they will destroy/ruin/break (E) what they (the worshippers/slaves) rose over (with) destruction/ruin/breakage.

Who was guided, so but he guides for himself, and who misguided, so but he misguides on it (himself) and no sinner/loader/burdener carries/loads/bears another's sins/load/burden , and We were not torturing until We send a messenger.
And if We willed/wanted that (E) We destroy/perish a village/urban city, We ordered/commanded its luxuriated ungrateful and arrogant, so they debauched in it, so the saying/words was deserved on it, so We destroyed it destructively.
And how many We destroyed/perished from the generations/peoples of eras from after Noah, and enough/sufficient with your Lord with His worshippers'/slaves' crimes, (He is) expert/experienced, seeing/knowing/understanding.

And do not deprive/yell at them (B) , and say to them (B) a gracious/kind saying/word.
And be lenient/comforting/lower to them (B) the humility's/humbleness's wing/side from the mercy (be kind), and say: "My Lord have mercy upon them (B) as they (B) brought me up young ."

And give/bring (to) of the relations his right/share , and the poorest of poor/poor oppressed, and the traveler/stranded traveler, and do not waste/squander, wastefully/squanderingly.
That (E) the wasters/squanderers were the devils' brothers, and the devil was to his Lord (an insisting) disbeliever.
And If/whenever you object/turn away (E) from them asking/desiring mercy you hope/expect for it from your Lord, so say to them: "An easy/little saying/word ." 
And do not make/put your hand chained or tied to your neck and do not spread/extend/widen it all the expansion/extension , so you sit/remain blameworthy/blamed grieving/sad .

And do not approach/near the orphan's property/possession/wealth except with which it is best until he reaches his maturity/strength, and fulfill/complete with the promise/contract , that (E) the promise/contract was/is questioned.
And fulfill/complete the measurement/weight if you measured/weighed, and weigh/measure with the scale/balance the balanced , that (is) best , and (a) better interpretation/explanation.
And do not follow the tracks/accuse of evil deeds what knowledge is not for you with it (you have no knowledge of), that the hearing/listening, and the eye sight/knowledge, and the heart , all (of) those are/were about it questioned.
And do not walk in the earth/Planet Earth showing superiority, happiness and over confidence , that you will never reach (the) end (of)/tear apart the earth/Planet Earth, and you will never reach the mountains (in) height/length (be as tall as the mountains).

Did your Lord choose/purify (specialize) you with the sons, and He took/received from the angels females? That you are saying (E) a great saying/word/opinion and belief.
And We had laid out/detailed linguistically in this the Koran, (so) they mention/remember (E) , and it does not increase them except hastening away with aversion.
Say: "If there were/are gods with Him as/like they say, then they would have wished/desired a way/path to (the owner) of the throne ."
His praise/glory, and high, mighty, exalted and dignified, about what they say great height, might and dignity.
The skies/space the seven, and the earth/Planet Earth, they praise/glorify to Him, and who (is) in them, and that (E) (there is not) from a thing except (it) praises/glorifies with His praise/gratitude/thanks, and but you do not understand their praise/glorification, that He was/is clement/patient powerful and capable, a forgiving.
And if you read the Koran, We made/put between you and between those who do not believe with the end (other life) a barrier/partition/protection , hidden/covered (invisible).
And We made/put on their hearts covers/protections that (E) they understand/learn/know it, and in their ears a heavy weight, and if you mentioned/remembered your Lord in the Koran alone, they turned away on their backs/ends hastening away with aversion .
We (are) more knowledgeable with what they hear/listen with it, when they hear/listen to you, and when they are confidentially talking/secretly conversing, when the unjust/oppressive say: "That (E) you follow except a bewitched/enchanted man."
Look/see/wonder about how they gave to you the examples/proverbs, so they became misguided, so they are not able (of) a way/path .
And they said: "Is (it that) if we were bones and debris/fragments/broken pieces are we being resurrected/revived (E) (in) a new creation?"
Say: "Be stones or iron."
Or a creation from what enlarges in your chests (innermosts). So they will say: "Who returns/repeats us?" Say: "Who created you/brought you into life (the) first time." So they will shake/shiver their heads to you in wonderment and say: "When/at what time it is?" Say: "Maybe/perhaps (it) becomes near/close."
A day/time He calls (to) you so you answer/reply with His praise/gratitude/thanks, and you think/assume that truly you stayed/remained except little (you think you did not stay except little).
And say to My worshippers/slaves, they (should) say which it is best , that the devil spoils/urges to evil between them, that the devil was/is to the human/mankind (a) clear/evident enemy.
Your Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (of) you, if He wills/wants He has mercy upon you, and if He wills/wants He tortures you, and We did not send you (as) a guardian/protector/keeper on them.
And your Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (of) who (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and We had preferred/favoured some (of) the prophets over some, and We gave/brought David a Book.
Say: "Call those whom you claimed/alleged from other than Him, so they do not own/posses the harm's removals from you, and nor a change/movement ."
Those are those who call, they desire the means/way of approach to their Lord, which of them (is) nearer/closer, and they hope/expect His mercy, and they fear His torture, that your Lord's torture was/is cautioned/warned/feared of.
And (there is) none from a village/urban city, except (that) We are making it die/destroying it before the Resurrection Day, or torturing it strong (severe) torture, that was/is in The Book written/inscribed/drafted.
And nothing prevented/prohibited us that (E) We send with the verses/evidences except that the first/beginners lied/denied/falsified with it, and We gave/brought Thamud the (F) camel manifest/clearly visible to the eye and understanding/clear evidence , so they caused injustice with it, and We do not sent with the verses/evidences/signs except frightening.
And when We said to you that your Lord took care of/was aware with the people, and We did not make the dream which We showed you except (as) a test to the people, and the tree the cursed in the Koran, and We frighten them, so it does not increase them except great tyranny .
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam." So they prostrated except Satan/Iblis, he said: "Do I prostrate to who you created (from) mud/clay ?"

He said: "Go/go away so who followed you from them, so that (E) Hell (is) your reimbursement , a reimbursement completed/abundant ."
And harass/disturb with your voice/noise whom you were able from them, and gather/urge on them with your horses/horsemen, and your men, and share them/be a partner with them in the properties/possessions/wealths, and the children, and promise them. And the devil does not promise them except deceit/temptation.
That (E) My worshippers/slaves power/control is not for you over them (you have no power/control over My worshippers/slaves). And enough/sufficient with God (as) a guardian/protector .
Your Lord (is) who drives/pushes for you the ships in the sea/ocean , to desire on them from His grace/favour , that He truly was/is with you merciful.
And if the harm touched you in the sea/ocean , whom you call (was) lost, except (only) Him, so when He saved/rescued you to the shore/land, you objected/turned away; and the human/mankind was/is (an insistent) disbeliever.
So (did) you become safe/secure that (E) he caves in with you the land's/shore's side/direction, or He sends on you a violent wind carrying pebbles and hail , then you do not find for you a guardian/protector ?
Or (did) you become safe/secure that (E) He returns/repeats you in it once/another again? So He sends on you a severe wind that breaks every thing in its path from the wind, so He drowns/sinks you because (of) what you disbelieved, then you do not find on Us with it a victorior/follower.
And We had honoured Adam's sons and daughters, and We carried/lifted them in the land/shore, and the sea/ocean , and We provided for them from the goodnesses , and We preferred/favoured them over many from whom We created preference/favour.
A day/time We call every people with their leader/example, so who was given/brought his Book/judgment with his right (hand), so those read their Book/judgment , and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed (the equivalent of) a cleft in a seed/a twine/a wick.
And who was in this blind/confused , so he is in the end (other life) blind/confused, and more misguided (in) a way/path .
And if they were about to/almost to misguide/seduce/mislead you (E) (away) from what We inspired/transmitted to you, to fabricate/cut and split on (about) Us other than it, and then they would have taken you (as) a faithful , close friend .
And were it not for that We encouraged/stabilized you, you would have (E) (been) almost to lean towards to them a little/small thing. 
Then We would have made you taste/experience double the life , and double the death/time of death, then you do not find a victorior/savior on (from) Us.
And if they were about to/almost to scare to drive you out from the land to bring/drive you out from it, and then they do not remain/wait behind you except little.
A law/manner (of) whom We had sent before you from Our messengers, and you do not find for Our law/manner a change/removal .
Start/keep up the prayers to the sun's nearing setting to the night's darkness, and the dawn's Koran, that the dawn's Koran was/is being witnessed.
And from the night so wake up and pray with it, done above the call of duty for you, maybe/perhaps that (E) your Lord sends/resurrects you a praised/thanked position/residence .
And say: "My Lord enter me a truthful entrance, and bring me out (in) a truthful exit, and make/put for me from at you a victorious/supportive proof/power/authority ."
And say: "The truth came and the falsehood vanished/perished , that (E) the falsehood was/is vanishing/perishing ."
And We descend from the Koran what it is a cure/recovery and mercy to the believers, and the unjust/oppressive do not increase except loss/misguidance and perishment.
And if We blessed on the human, he objected/turned away and he went far with his side/direction, and if the bad/evil/harm touched him, (he) was/is despairing/hopeless.
Say: "Each/every makes/does on his nature/disposition , so your Lord (is) more knowledgeable with whom he is more guided (in) a way/path ."
And they ask/question you about the Soul/Spirit , say: "The Soul/Spirit (is) from my Lord's matter/affair, and you were not given from the knowledge except little ."
And if (E) We willed wanted We will take away/eliminate with what We inspired/transmitted to you, then you do not find for you with it on (against) Us a guardian/protector .
Except mercy from your Lord, that (E) His grace/favour/blessing was great on you.
Say: "If (E) the human/mankind and the Jinns gathered/unified on that (E) they come with similar/equal/alike (to) this the Koran, they do not come with similar/equal/alike to it, and even if some of them were to some, (were to each other) supporting/helping."
And We had laid out/detailed linguistically to the people in this the Koran from every example/proverb, so most of the people refused/hated except (insisting) disbelief.
And they said: "We will never/not believe to you until you cause a water spring/well to flow/burst from the land ."
Or a treed garden of palm trees and grapes/fruits of the vine be for you, so you cause the rivers/waterways to flow/burst in between and round it flowing/bursting.
Or you drop the sky pieces on us as you claimed/alleged , or you come with God and the angels facing/from front . 
Or (a) house/home from ornament/gold be for you, or you ascend/climb in the sky , and We will never/not believe to your ascent/climb until you descend on us a book we read it. Say: "My Lord's praise/glory, have I been except a human, a messenger?"
And what prevented/forbid the people that (E) they believe when the guidance came to them, except that (E) they said: "Did God send a human, messenger?"
Say: "If there were in the earth/Planet Ea rth angels walking assured/secured , We would have descended on them from the sky/space an angel (as) a messenger."
Say: "Enough/sufficient with God, (as) a witness/testifier between me and between you, that He truly was/is with His worshippers/slaves expert/experienced, seeing/knowing."
And whom God guides so he is the guided, and whom He misguides, so you will never/not find for them guardians/protectors from other than Him, and We gather them (on) the Resurrection Day on their faces/fronts, blind, and mute, and deaf, their shelter/refuge (is) Hell, whenever (it) became humble/tranquil (subsided), We increased them blazing/inflaming.
That (is) their reward because they (E) disbelieved with Our verses/evidences and they said: "Is (it that) if we were bones and debris/fragments , are we being resurrected/revived (E) (as a) new creation?"
Did they not see/understand that God (is) who created the skies/space and the Earth/Planet Earth (and is) capable on that (E) (He) creates similar/equal to them, and He made/put for them a term/time no doubt/suspicion in it, so the unjust/oppressive refused/hated except (insisting) disbelief.
Say: "If you own/possess my Lord's safes/storages (of) mercy, then you would have held/seized (E) fear (of) the spending/expenditure (poverty), and the human was/is miserly/stingy."
And We had given/brought to Moses nine evidences/signs evidences, so ask/question Israel's sons and daughters, when (he) came to them, so Pharaoh said to him: "That I, I think/suspect you (E) you, Moses, (are) bewitched/enchanted."
He Said: "You had known none descended those, except the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's Lord, evidences , and that I think/suspect you (E) , you Pharaoh, (are) destroyed/cursed ."
So he wanted/intended that (E) he harasses/scares them away from the land so We drowned/sunk him and who (is) with him all together .
And We said from after him to Israel's sons and daughters: "Reside/inhabit the land/Planet Earth , so if the ends' (other life's) promise came, We came with you (in) mixed crowds/huge gatherings ."
And by the truth We descended it, and by the truth it descended, and We did not send you except (as an) announcer of good news and (a) warner/giver of notice .
And a Koran We distinguished it to read it on (to) the people on slow deliberation/comprehension , and We descended it descending.
Say: "Believe with it or do not believe, that (E) those who were given/brought to the knowledge, from before it, if (it) is being read/recited on them, they fall down to the chins/beards prostrating."
And they say: "Praise/glory (to) our Lord that truly our Lord's promise was made/done (E)." 
And they fall down to the chins/beards weeping and He/it (the weeping) increases them humbleness/submission .
Say: "Call God, or call the merciful, whichever you call, so for Him (are) the names the best/most beautiful (the good names), and do not publicize/declare/raise (voice) with your prayers, and do not silence/lower and hide with it, and wish/desire between that a way/method."
And say: "The praise/gratitude (is) to God who did not take (a) child (son), and (there) had not been/is not a partner for Him in the ownership/kingdom , and (there) had not been/is not for Him (a) guardian/protector from the humbleness/weakness , and greaten/magnify Him , greatness/enlargement ."  
The praise/gratitude (is) to God who descended on His worshipper/slave The Book , and He did not make/create for it crookedness/indirectness .
A straight/valuable (Book) to warn/give notice (of) a severe power/might from at Him, and (it) announces good news (to) the believers those who make/do the correct/righteous deeds , that (E) for them (is a) good/beautiful reward .
(They) are remaining/residing in it forever/eternally (E).
And He/it warns/gives notice (to) those who said: "God took/received a child (a son)."
Nothing from knowledge (is) to them with it (they have no knowledge of it) and nor to their fathers, a word/speech/sermon became big (that) emerges from their mouths, that they say except lies/denials/falsifications (about God).
So maybe/perhaps you (are) exhausting/destroying yourself from anger sorrowfully/angrily on their tracks , if they do not believe with this the information/speech.
We have made/put what (is) on the earth/Planet Earth (as) decoration/beauty for it, to test them which of them (is) better (in) a deed .
And We are making/putting (E) what (is) on it destroyed/infertile dust.
Or (have) you thought/supposed that (E) the cave's and The Book's/inscription's owners/company , were (in) astonishment/amazement from Our verses/signs/evidences? (Did you think that the cave's and The Book's people were strange or amazing?)
When the youths/servants took shelter/refuge to (in) the cave , so they said: "Our Lord give/bring us from at You mercy and prepare/make possible for us from our matter/affair (a) correct/right guidance."
So We stamped/resided/palpitated (refer to in dictionary) on their ears in the cave numerous years.
Then We sent/resurrected/revived them to know which (of) the two groups/parties (is) more counting/controlling to what time they remained/waited .
We narrate/inform on (to) you their information/news with the truth , that they truly are youths/servants , they believed with their Lord, and We increased them guidance.
And We strengthened/braced , on their hearts/minds , when they stood/kept up , so they said: "Our Lord, Lord (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, we will never/not call from other than Him, a god, (what) we had then said (is) being unjust/excess of the limit ."
Those (are) Our nation they took from other than Him gods, if only they come on them with a proof/authority , clear/shown/explained, so who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated/cut and split on (about) God lies/denials/falsifications?
And when you separated/isolated/withdrew yourselves from them and what they worship, except God, so takeshelter/refuge to the cave , your Lord spreads/extends for you from His mercy, and He prepares/makes possible for you from your matter/affair convenience/benefit/help.
And you see the sun when it rose/ascended/appeared, it bends and curves/visits on their cave that of the right, and when it departed/declined/set, it parallels/crosses/passes them that of the left, and they are in an opening from it; that (is) from God's verses/signs/evidences; whom God guides so he is the guided, and whom He misguides/who misguides (others) so you will never/not find for him a guardian/ally a correct/right guide.
And you think/suppose them (to be) awake/alert, and they are asleep/lying down, and We turn them/turn them around that of the right (side), and that of the left (side), and their dog (is) spreading/extending its two arms (paws) at the cave/doorstep/mountain , if you saw/looked on/over them you would have turned away from them escaping/fleeing/running away, and you would have been filled (by) terror/fright from them.
And as/like that We sent/resurrected/revived them to ask/question each other between them, a speaker from them said: "How much (have) you stayed/remained ?" They said: "We stayed/remained a day or part of a day." They said: "Your Lord (is) more knowledgeable with what you stayed/remained , so send one of you with this your paper/money to the city/town so he looks/watches/waits (E) which/what (is a) more pure/correct food, so he comes to you with a provision/means of livelihood from it, and (he) should be courteous/polite , and do not make anyone feel/know/sense with (about) you."
That they truly if they see and know of/overcome on you, they stone you, or they return you in (to) their religion/faith, and you will never/not win/succeed then ever (E).
And as/like that We made be stumbled upon on them (We made them be stumbled upon) to know that God's promise (is) truth , and that (E) the Hour/Resurrection (there is) no doubt/suspicion in it, when they dispute/argue their matter/affair between them, so they said: "Build/construct on them a building/structure, their Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (of) them." Those who defeated/overcame on their matter/affair said: "We will take (E) on them a mosque/place of worshipping God."
They will say: "Three, their fourth (is) their dog." And they say: "Five, their sixth (is) their dog." An unsubstantiated guess with the unseen/absent , and they say: "Seven and their eighth (is) their dog." Say: "My Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (of) their number, none knows them except few/little , so do not argue/discuss in (about) them, except apparent/visible argument/discussion, and do not take (an) opinion/a clarification (of)anyone from them in (about) them."
And do not say (E) to a thing: "That I am making/doing that tomorrow/(in the) future."
Except that (E) God wills/wants, and mention/remember your Lord if you forgot, and say: "Maybe/perhaps that (E) my Lord guides me to nearer/closer than that (a) correct/right guidance."
And they stayed/remained in their cave three hundred years and they were increased (by) nine (years).
Say: "God (is) more knowledgeable with what they stayed/remained , for Him (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's unseen/invisible , see/look/understand with Him, and make (to) hear/listen, (there is) none for them from other than Him (as a) guardian/ally , and He does not share/make partners in His judgment/rule anyone. 
And read/recite what was inspired/transmitted to you from your Lord's Book , (there is) no exchanger/replacer/substitutor to His words/expressions, and you will never/not find from other than Him a shelter/refuge.
And be patient your self with those who call their Lord at early mornings/between dawn and sunrise and (during) the evening/first darkness/dinnertime, they want His face/direction , and do not pass your two eyes from them, you want the life the present's/worldly life's decoration/beauty , and do not obey whom We ig nored/neglected/disregarded his heart/mind from mentioning/remembering Us , and he followed his self attraction for desire , and his matter/affair was wasteful/excessive of the limit.
And say: "The truth (is) from your Lord, so who willed/wanted, so he should believe, and who willed/wanted, so he should disbelieve, that We have prepared/made ready to the unjust/oppressive a fire, its elevated surrounding ash/smoke encircled/enveloped with them, and if they seek/ask for help (rain) they be helped/aided/rained upon with water as the dead's pus/refined oil , (it) roasts/grills the faces/fronts, how bad (is) the drink? And it was a bad/evil/harmful convenience/benefit ."
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, we (E)do not loose/waste (the) reward (of) whom did good deed(s).
Those are for them treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath/below them, they be bejeweled/decorated in it from bracelets from gold, and they dress/wear green clothes/garments from sarcenet (a certain type of silk or brocade), and brocade (silk and gold fabric), leaning/reclining/resting on the luxurious beds/couches in it, blessed/praised (is) the reward/compensation , and (it) became a good/beautiful companion/convenience .
And give for them an example/proverb (of) two men, We made/created to one of them two treed gardens from grapes, and We surrounded/encircled them (B) with palm trees, and We made/put between them (B) plants/crops.
Each of them (B) the two treed gardens gave/brought its food/fruits and (it) did not cause injustice from it a thing, and We caused to flow/burst in between and around it a river/waterway.
And for him was fruit, so he said to his companion/friend and he, he is discussing/debating with him: "I am more than you (in) property/possession/wealth and more powerful (in) a group/family/tribe."
And he entered his treed garden and he is unjust/oppressive to himself, he said: "I do not think/suppose that this be destroyed/perished ever (E)."
And I do not think/suppose (that) the Hour/Resurrection (is) starting , and if (E) I returned to my Lord I will find (E) better than it a place of return .
His companion/friend said to him and he is discussing/debating with him: "Did you disbelieve with Who created you from dust/earth then from a drop/male's or females' secretion , then He straightened you (into) a man?"
But/however I, (to me) He is God my Lord, and I do not share/make partners with my Lord anyone.
And if only when you entered your treed garden, you said: 'What God willed/wanted! No strength/power except by God,' if you see me, I am less/fewer than you (in) property/possession/wealth and children . 
So maybe/perhaps my Lord that He gives/brings me better than your treed garden, and He sends on it thunder storms/small arrows from the sky/space, so it becomes/becomes in the morning slippery/slithery dust.
Or its water becomes/becomes in the morning deep/deeply sunk/bottomed, so you will never/not be able for it seeking/wanting (be unable to retrieve water).
And (he) was surrounded/encircled with his fruit, so he became/became in the morning, he turns/turns around/turns over his two palms, on (about) what he spent in it, and it is fallen/destroyed/empty on its branches/grape vines and he says: "Oh I wish I would have not shared/made partners with my Lord anyone."
And (there) was not for him a group they give him victory from other than God, and he was not a victorious.
At that place and time the ownership/might (is) to God, the truth , He is (the) best (in) reward/replacement/compensation and best (in) an end.
And give to them the life the present's/worldly life's example/proverb as water, We descended it from the sky , so the land's/Earth's plant mixed/mingled with it, so it became/became in the morning dried and broken plants/trees, the winds/breezes scatter/spread/winnow it (the water) and God was/is on every thing capable/able/powerful .
The property/possession/wealth and the sons/sons and daughters (are) the life the present's/worldly life's decoration/beauty , and the remainders the correct/righteous deeds (are) better at your Lord (in) a reward/replacement , and better hope.
And a day We move/manipulate the mountains and you see the earth/Planet Earth emerging/appearing, and We gathered them, so We did not leave out from them anyone.
And they were displayed/exhibited on (to) your Lord (in) a row/line/arranged (and told): "You had come to Us as We created you (on the) first/beginning time , but you claimed/alleged that We not make for you an appointment."
And The Book was put/laid/raised , so you see the criminals/sinners afraid/cautious from what (is) in it, and they say: "Oh our calamity/scandal , what to that The Book , (it) does not leave out small/little and nor big/great except it counted/computed it ?" And they found what they made/did present, and your Lord does not cause injustice/oppression (to) anyone.
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam, so they prostrated except Satan/Iblis (he) was from the Jinns/an intelligent free willing creature created before man , so he debauched from his Lord's order/command , do you take him and his descendants (as) guardians/allies from other than Me? And they are for you an enemy, and how bad to the unjust/oppressive an exchange/replacement/substitution?
I did not make them witness/testify the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's creation, and nor creation (of) themselves, and I was not taking the misguiders (as) support/help/assistance.
And a day , He says: "Call my partners those whom you claimed/alleged ." So they called them, so they did not answer/reply to them, and We made/put between them a barrier/shut off .
And the criminals/sinners saw/understood the fire, so they thought/assumed that they (are) falling/landing/expecting in it, and they did not find from it a diversion/return.
And We had laid out/detailed linguistically in this the Koran to the people from every example/proverb, and the human/mankind was (the) most arguing/disputing thing.
And what prevented/forbid the people that (E) they believe when the guidance came to them? And they ask for forgiveness (from) their Lord? Except that the first's/beginner's law/manner comes to them or the punishment comes to them in front/facing front.
And We do not send the messengers except (as) announcers of good news and warners/givers of notice, and those who disbelieved argue/dispute with/by the falsehood to nullify with it the truth , and they took My verses/evidences and what they were warned/given notice (with it) mockingly/making fun.
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who was reminded with his Lord's evidences/signs/verses, so he objected/turned away from it, and he forgot what his two hands advanced/introduced/ undertook , We (E) had made/put covers/protections on their hearts/minds that they understand/know it , and in their ears deafness/weight , and if you call them to the guidance, so they will never/not be guided then ever (E).
And your Lord (is) the forgiving, (owner) of the mercy, if He punishes/takes them because (of)what they gained/gathered/acquired , He would have hurried/hastened for them the torture, but for them (is) an appointment, they will never/not find from other than it a shelter/refuge .
And those are the villages/urban cities, We destroyed them when they caused injustice/oppression, and We made/put for their death/destruction an appointment.
And when Moses said to his youth/servant , I will not leave/depart until I reach the two seas'/oceans'/rivers' place of meeting (point of joint), or I pass/complete a period of time.
So when they (B) reached (a) place of meeting (point of joint) between them (B) (the two seas/oceans/rivers), they (B) forgot their (B)'s fish/large fish/whale, so it took/received its path in the sea/ocean/river sneaking away (it escaped into the body of water).
So when they (B) crossed/passed through he said to his youth/servant : "Give/bring us our breakfast/lunch, we had met/found hardship/fatigue from this our journey/voyage ."
He said: "Did you see/understand when we took refuge to the rock, so that I, I forgot the fish/large fish/whale and nothing made me forget it that I remember it except the devil, and it took/received its way path in the sea/ocean/river (in) astonishment/surprise/amazement."
He said: "That (is) not (what) we were wishing/desiring ." So they (B) returned on their (B)'s tracks/marks following/tracking.
So they (B) found a worshipper/slave from Our worshippers/slaves, We gave/brought him from at Us mercy, and We taught/instructed him from at Us knowledge.
Moses said to him: "Do I follow you, on that you teach/instruct me from what you were taught/instructed correct/right guidance?"
He said: "That you will never/not be able (to have) patience with me."
And how (do) you be patient on what you did not comprehend/encircle with it a knowledge/information ? 
He Said: "You will find me if God wanted/willed patient, and I (will) not disobey for you an order/command."
He Said: "So if you followed me, so do not ask/question me on (about) a thing, until I initiate/tell to you from it a reminder/remembrance."
So they (B) left/set out until when they (B) rode/boarded in the ship/boat, he made a hole/opening (in) it, he (Moses) said: "Did you make a hole/opening (in) it to drown/sink its people ? You had come (with) a strange/denied thing."
He said: "Did I not say that you will never/not be able (to have) patience with me?"
He said: "Do not take/punish me with what I forgot, and do not burden/oppress me from my matter/affair (with) difficult(ty)/strained circumstances ."
So they (B) left/set out until when they (B) met/found a servant/boy , so he killed him. He (Moses) said: "Did you kill a pure self without a self? You had come (with) an awful/obscene thing."
He Said: "Did I not say to you, that you will never/not be able (to have) patience with me?"
He said: "If I asked/questioned you , about a thing after it, so do not accompany/befriend me, you had reached an excuse from at me."
So they (B) left/set out until when they (B) came (to) a village/urban city, they asked its people to be fed, so they refused/hated that they have them (B) as guests/help them , so they (B) found in it a wall wanting that to fall down/be wrecked, so he raised it, he (Moses) said: "If you wanted/willed you would have taken/received on (for) it a wage/fee ."
He said: "This (is) separation between me and between you, I will inform you with (an) explanation/interpretation on (of) what you were not able (to have) patience on it."
As for the ship/boat, so it was to (owned by) poorest of poor/poor oppressed working in the sea/ocean/river , so I wanted that I defect it , and behind them was a king he takes/receives every ship/boat forcefully/unjustly/violently.
And as for the boy/servant , so his parents were believing, so We feared that he burdens/oppresses them (with) tyranny/arrogance and disbelief.
So We wanted/intended that their (B)'s Lord exchanges/substitutes (for) them (B) better than him and purification/correction and nearer/closer (in) mercy/relation.
And as for the wall, so it was (belonging) to two boys , two orphans in the city/town, and under it was a treasure/buried treasure for them (B), and their (B)'s father was correct/righteous, so your Lord wanted/willed that they (B) reach their (B)'s maturity/strength, and they (B) bring out their (B)'s treasure/buried treasure, mercy from your Lord, and I did not make/do it from my matter/affair, that (is) explanation/interpretation (of) what you were not able (to have) patience on it.
And they ask/question you about (owner) of the two horns/powers/glories , Say: "I will read/recite on (to) you from him a reminder/remembrance."
We have highly positioned/strengthened for him in the earth/Planet Earth, and We gave/brought him from every thing a reason/motive/connection . 
So he followed a reason/motive/connection .
Until when he reached the sun's sunset/west , he found it departing/declining (setting) in (at a) water well/spring mixed with black (foul) mud, and he found at it a nation, We said: "You (owner) of the two horns/powers/glories, either that you torture, and either you take in them a goodness/beauty."
He said: "As for who caused injustice/oppression, so we will/shall torture him, then he be returned to his Lord, so He tortures him an awful/obscene/severe torture."
And as for who believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so to him the best's/goodnesses' reward/reimbursement , and we will say to him from our order/matter ease/flexibility.
Then he followed a reason/motive/connection .
Until when he reached the sun's place and time of appearance/ascent , he found it appears/ascends/rises on a nation We did not make/put from other than it a cover/protection/shelter .
Like that, and We had comprehended/enveloped with what (is) at/near him (with) knowledge .
Then he followed a reason/motive/connection.
Until when he reached between the two barriers/obstacles/mountains , he found from other than them (B) a nation they are not about to/almost understand a saying/opinion and belief .
They said: "You (owner) of the two horns/powers/glories, that Yagog and Magog (are) corrupting in the earth/Planet Earth, so do we make/put for you (a) royalty/retainer/expense/tribute on that you put/create between us and between them a barrier/obstacle ?"
He said: "What my Lord highly positioned/strengthened/empowered me in it (is) best , so help/support me with power/strength , I make/create/put between you and between them a blockage/barrier ."
Give/bring me the huge pieces of iron. Until when he straightened/leveled/equalized between the two sides/directions/mountain sides , he said: "Blow." Until when he made it a fire, he said: "Give/bring me, I pour on it molten copper/brass/iron ."
So they did not rise/diffuse/spread over (it, nor) that they mount/ascend it , and they were not able (of) piercing/penetration for it.
He said: "That (is) mercy from my Lord, so if my Lord's promise came, he made it flattened/leveled off and my Lord's promise was truthfully (truthful) ."
And We left some/part of them (on) that day (to) trouble/agitate (interlock) in some/part, and the horn/bugle/instrument was blown in, so We gathered/collected them all together .
And We displayed/presented Hell (on) that day to the disbelievers a display/exhibition .
Those who their eyes/sights were in a cover/concealment from My remembrance/reminder, and they were not being able (of) hearing/listening .
Did those who disbelieved think/suppose that they take My worshippers/slaves (as) guardians/allies from other than Me? We have prepared/made ready for the disbelievers Hell (as) a place of descent .
Say: "Do We inform you with the most losers (in their) deeds ?"
Those whom their endeavors/striving (was) wasted/lost in the life the present/worldly life and they, they think/suppose that they, they do good work/performance .
Those are those who disbelieved with their Lord's verses/evidences and meeting Him, so their deeds failed/wasted, so We do not take care of (evaluate) for them a weight/measure (on) the Resurrection Day.
That (is) their reward/reimbursement , Hell because (of) what they disbelieved, and they took My verses/evidences and My messengers mockingly/making fun.
That (E) those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, (the) treed garden/Paradise (of) the treed garden/Paradise/Elferdowse (one of the Paradises) was for them (as) a place of descent .
Immortally/eternally in it, they do not wish/desire (away) from it (a) change/removal/movement.
Say: "If the sea/ocean was ink/writing liquid for my Lord's words/expressions, the sea/ocean would have been depleted/exhausted (E) before that my Lord's words/expressions deplete/exhaust , and even if We came with equal/alike to it (to the sea/ocean) (for) ink/writing liquid (as) an extension/spread."
Say: "Truly I am (a) human equal/alike to you, (it) is being inspired/transmitted to me that your God (is) one God, so who was hoping/expecting his Lord's meeting, so he makes/does (E) correct/righteous deeds deed , and he does not share/make partners with worshipping his Lord anyone."  
K H Y EN S/C .
Your Lord's mercy mention (on) His worshipper/slave Zachary/Zacharias .
When he called/cried (to) his Lord a hidden/secret call/cry.
He said: "My Lord that I, the bones weakened/enfeebled from me, and the hair turned white or gray and my Lord I was not miserable/unhappy with calling you."
And that I, I feared the followers/dependents from behind/beyond me, and my woman (wife) was infertile to grant/present for me from at you a follower/friend .
(He) inherits me and (he) inherits from Jacob's family, and my Lord make him accepted/approved/satisfied .
You Zacharias/Zachary , that We, We announce good news to you with a boy , his name (is) John/Yahya , We did not make for him from before (an) equivalent/equivalent in height/position .
He said: "My Lord that how (could there) be for me a boy and my woman (wife) was infertile and I had reached from the old age exceeding the limit?"
He said: "Like that." Your Lord said: "It is on Me easy/light , and I had created you from before, and you were not a thing."
He said: "My Lord, make/put for me a sign/evidence." He said: "Your sign/evidence (is) that you do not converse/talk (to) the people three nights straight ."
So he emerged on (to) his nation, from the center of the assembly/the prayers' niche , so he inspired/transmitted/signaled to them that praise/glorify (at) daybreaks/early mornings and evenings/first darkness/dinnertime.
You John/Yahya, take The Book with power/strength, and We gave/brought him the judgment/rule (as) a boy/child/infant.
And compassion/kindness from at Us, and purification/correction and he was fearing and obeying.
And righteous/obedient with his parents, and he was not a disobedient tyrant/rebel .
And security/peace on him (on the) day he was born and (the) day he dies, and (the) day he be sent/resurrected/revived alive.
And remember/mention in The Book Mary when she distantly isolated herself from her family/relation (to) an easterly/eastern place/position.
So she took from other than them a divider/protection , so We sent to her Our Soul/Spirit , so he simulated/represented to her (as an) upright/average human.
She said: "That I, I seek protection by the merciful from you, if you were fearing and obeying."
He said: "Truly I am your Lord's messenger to grant/present for you a pure/righteous boy ."
She said: "How/from where (there) be for me a boy and (a) human has not touched me, and I was not afornicatress/adulteress/prostitute ?
He said: "'Like that,' said your Lord, it is on Me easy/light , and to make/put him (as) a sign/evidence to the people, and mercy from Us, and (it was) a matter/command accomplished/ executed .'"
So she was pregnant (with) him so she distantly isolated herself with him (to) a far/remote place/position.
So the labour/childbirth came to her to (at) the palm tree's trunk/stem, she said: "Oh I wish I would have died before this and I was forgotten (and long) forgotten."
So he (Jesus) called her from below/beneath her: "That do not be sad/grieving, your Lord had put below/beneath you a stream/clearance of a burden/generosity ."
And shake/move to(wards) you with the palm tree's trunk/stem, it causes freshly harvested/gathered ripe/moist (dates) to fall/drop repeatedly on you.
So eat and drink and be delighted/satisfied eye(s) (delight your eyes), so when you see anyone from the human, so say: 'That I made a duty/vow (on myself) to the merciful, a fast , so I will not converse/speak the day/today (to) a human .'
So she came with him (to) her nation carrying him , they said: "You Mary, you had come (with) a strange and confusing thing."
You Aaron's sister, your father was not (a) human/man of bad/evil , and your mother was not an fornicatress/adulteress/prostitute.
So she pointed/indicated to him, they said: "How (do) we converse/speak (to) whom was in the crib/cradle a boy/child/infant?"
He said: "That I am God's worshipper/slave, He gave/brought me The Book and He made me a prophet."
And He made me blessed, wherever I was/am, and He directed/commanded me with the prayers and the charity/purification as long as I continued/lasted alive.
And charitable/obedient with my mother, and He did not make me a miserable/unhappy tyrant/rebel .
And the security/peace (was) on me (on the) day I was born, and (the) day I die, and (the) day I be sent/resurrected/revived alive.
That (was) Jesus Mary's son, the correct/real saying/opinion and belief which they (are) doubting/arguing in it.
(It) was not to God that (He) take from a child/children (son), His praise/glory, if He ordered/executed amatter/command , so but He says to it: "Be, so it becomes."
And that God (is) my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him, that (is) a straight/direct road/way.
So the groups/parties differed/disagreed/disputed from between them, so grief/distress to those who disbelieved from an assembly of a great day.
Make (to) hear/listen with them, and make to see/understand , a day they come to Us, but the unjust/oppressive today (are) in evident misguidance. 
And warn/give them notice (of) the Grief's Day/Resurrection Day, when the matter/affair was accomplished/carried out , and they are in negligence/disregard, and they are not believing.
That We, We inhabit the earth/Planet Earth, and who (is) on it, and to Us they return.
And remember/mention in The Book Abraham, that he truly was an always very truthful prophet.
When he said to his father: "You my father, for what (do) you worship what does not hear/listen, and nor see/understand , and nor enrich/suffice from you a thing?"
You my father, that I, (it) had come to me from the knowledge, what did not come to you, so follow me, I guide you a straight/level road/way.
You my father, do not worship the devil, that the devil was/is to the merciful disobedient.
You my father, that I fear that torture touches you from the merciful, so you be to the devil an ally/follower .
He said: "Are you shunning/turning away from my gods, you Abraham? If (E) you do not end/terminate/stop, I will stone you, and leave/distance me a long/life time."
He said: "Security/peace on you, I will ask for forgiveness for you (from) my Lord, that He truly (was) with me generous/blessing ."
And I separate/isolate myself from you and what you call from other than God, and I call my Lord, maybe/perhaps that I not be with my Lord's call/prayer miserable/unhappy.
So when he separated/isolated himself from them, and what they call from other than God, We granted for him Issac , and Jacob and each/all, We made a prophet.
And We granted for them from Our mercy, and We made for them (a) truthful high and mighty/dignified tongue/language/speech.
And remember/mention in The Book Moses, that he truly was faithful/loyal/devoted and (he) was a messenger, a prophet.
And We called him from the mountain's side/direction, the right (side), and We neared/approached him secretly conversing.
And We granted for him from Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet.
And remember/mention in The Book Ishmael , that he truly was truthful (in) the promise, and was a messenger, a prophet.
And (he) was ordering/commanding his family/people with the prayers and the charity/purification, and (he) was at his Lord accepted/approved.
And remember/mention in The Book Idris, that he truly was always very truthful, and a prophet.
And We raised him a high and mighty/dignified place/position.
Those are those who God blessed/praised on them from the prophets from Adam's descendants; and from who We carried with Noah, , and from Abraham's and Ishmael's descendants, and from who We guided and We chose/purified, if the merciful's verses/evidences are read/recited on them they fell down prostrating and weeping .
So succeeded/followed from after them a succession , they lost/wasted/destroyed the prayers, and they followed the lusts/desires/cravings, so they will/shall meet/find misguidance/failure .
Except who repented and believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so those, they enter the Paradise, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed a thing.
Treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence which the merciful promises His worshippers/slaves with the unseen/hidden , that He truly, His promise was/is coming (E).
They do not hear/listen in it nonsense/senseless talk , except (a) greeting/safety/peace and for them, (is) their provision in it (at) daybreaks/early mornings and (at) evening/first darkness/dinnertime.
That (is) the paradise which We make inherit (to) who was fearing and obeying from Our worshippers/slaves.
And We do not descend except with your Lord's order/command, for Him what (is) between Our hands, and what (is) behind Us, and what (is) between that, and your Lord was not frequently forgetting.
The skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's and what (is) between them (B)'s Lord, so worship Him, and endure patience to His worshipping, do you know (an) equivalent to Him?"
And the human/mankind says: "Is (it that) if I died, I will/shall (E) be brought out alive! ."(expression of wonderment).
Or does not the human remember that We created him from before and (he) was not a thing?
So by your Lord We will gather them (E), and the devils, then We will present/bring them (E) around Hell kneeling/standing on (their) toes.
Then We will remove (E) from every group/party which of them (is) stronger arrogant/disobedience on (to) the merciful.
Then We are (E) more knowledgeable with (about) those who, they are more worthy/deserving roasting/suffering/burning with (in) it (Hell).
And that from you (there is not) except (who is) nearing/approaching it , (that) was on (by) your Lord decidedly/positively ordered/executed .
Then We save/rescue those who feared and obeyed, and We leave (disregard) the unjust/oppressors in it kneeling/standing on (their) toes.
And when Our evidences/verses evidences are read/recited on (to) them, those who disbelieved said to those who believed: "Which (of) the two groups/parties/flocks is (in) better residence and best gathering/assembly/club?"
And how many We destroyed from before them from people of one era/generation/century? They are better home effects/money and appearance/pleasant appearance.
Say: "Who was in the misguidance, so the merciful will extend/spread (E) for him extension/spreading until when they saw/understood what they are being promised, either the torture, and either the Hour/Resurrection , so they will know who he is worst (in) a place/position, and weaker soldiers/warriors."
And God increases those who were guided (in) guidance, and the remainders the correct/righteous deeds (are) better at your Lord a replacement/compensation and better (in) a return.
So did you see/understand who disbelieved with Our evidences/verses, and said: "I will be given property/possession/wealth and children ?"
Has he seen/been informed (of) the unseen/absent , or he took/received at the merciful a promise/contract ?
No but, We will write/dictate what he says, and We extend/spread to him from the torture extension/spreading.
And We make him inherit what he says, and he comes to Us singly/alone.
And they took/received from other than God gods, to be for them glory/might/honour .
No but they will disbelieve with their worshipping, and they (are) on them adversaries/opponents .
Do you not see/understand that We sent the devils on (to) the disbelievers, they penetrate their minds/influence them penetration of their minds/influence.
So do not hurry/hasten/rush on them, but We count for them counting.
A day We gather the fearing and obeying to the merciful (as) a delegation of dignitaries.
And We drive (herd) the criminals/sinners to Hell successively in groups.
They do not own/possess the mediation, except who took/received at the merciful a promise/contract .
And they said: "The merciful took/received a child (son)."
You had come (with) a blasphemous/disastrous thing.
The skies/space are about to/almost split/crack/cleave from it, and the earth/Planet Earth splits/cracks open ,and the mountains fall down (in) demolition and breaking down into pieces violently with noise.
That (E) they called to the merciful a child (son).
And (it) would not (be) to the merciful that He takes a child (son).
That every/each whom (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth except is coming (E) (to) the merciful (as) a worshipper/slave .
He had counted/completed them and He counted them counting.
And all of them are coming to Him (in) the Resurrection Day singly/alone/one.
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, the merciful will make/create for them love/affection.
So but We eased it with your tongue/language, to announce good news with it (to) the fearing and obeying, and warn/give notice with it (to) a nation (in) harsh/violent dispute
And how many before them We destroyed from people of one era/generation/century, do you sense/feel from them from anyone, or hear for them (a) low voice/whisper/faint sound? 
T H .
We did not descend the Koran on you to (to) be miserable/unhappy.
Except (as) a reminder to who fears.
Descent from who created the earth/Planet Earth and the skies/space, the high/elevated.
The merciful on the throne He aimed to/sat on/straightened .
For Him what (is) in the skies/space, and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and what (is) between them (B), and what (is) below/beneath the moist dust/earth .
And if you publicize/declare with the saying/word/opinion and belief , so that He truly knows the secret and (what is) more hidden.
God, no god except Him, for Him (are) the names the best/most beautiful .
And did Moses', information/speech come to you?
When he saw a fire, so he said to his family: "Wait/remain/stay, that I , I perceived/saw a fire, maybe/perhaps I come to you from it with a fire's flame/torch, or I find on (at) the fire guidance."
So when he came to it, (it) was called: "You Moses."
That I, I am your Lord, so take off your two shoes , that you are at the Valley the Holy/Hallowed/Sanctified/Blessed Tuwan/wrapped within (itself) .
And I, I chose you, so hear/listen to what is inspired/transmitted .
That I , I am God, no god except Me, so worship Me, and keep up/start the prayers for mentioning/remembering Me (E).
That (E) the Hour/Resurrection is coming, I am about to/almost, I hide it, (so) each self (is) to be rewarded/reimbursed because (of) what it strives/endeavors
So who does not believe with it and he followed his self attraction for desire does not object/prevent/obstruct you from it, so you fall/be destroyed .
And what (is) that at your right (hand) you, Moses?
He said: "It is my stick/cane, I lean on/support myself on it, and I hit/move/shake with it on my sheep and goats, and for me in it others needs/purposes."
He said: "Throw it away, you Moses."
So he threw it away, so then it is (a) quick moving snake/alive.
He said: "Take it and do not fear, We will return it (to) its form , the first/beginning."
And gather/join (fold) your hand to your wing/side, it appears/emerges white with no evil/harm , another evidence/sign .
To show you/make you understand (E) from Our evidences/signs the greatest/biggest .
Go to Pharaoh, that he truly tyrannized .
He said: "My Lord expand/delight for me, my chest (innermost)."
And ease/make flexible for me my matter/affair.
And untie/undo (the) difficulty/knot from my tongue/speech.
They understand/know my speech .
And make/put for me a minister/supporter from my family/relation .
Aaron, my brother.
Strengthen/support with him my power .
And share him/make him a partner in my matter/affair.
So that/in order that we praise/glorify you much.
And we mention/remember you much.
That you were/are with us seeing/knowing .
He said: "You had been given your request/question, you Moses."
And We had blessed on you another time.
When We inspired/transmitted to your mother what is being inspired/transmitted.
That throw/hurl him in the box/chest so throw/hurl him in the body of water (sea/river/lake), so the body of water (sea/river/lake) will throw him by the shore/(river) bank/coast. An enemy for Me, and an enemy for him takes/receives him; and I threw on you love/affection from Me, and to be made on My sight/watchfulness/protection.
And when your sister walks, so she says: Do I guide/lead you on (to) who maintains him ?" So We returned you to your mother, in order that her eye/sight delight/satisfy , and nor she be saddened/grieved, and you killed a self so We saved/rescued you from the grief/sadness/depression, and We tested you , testfully , so you stayed/remained years in Madya's people , then you came on a predestiny you Moses."
And I made you for My self.
Go, you and your brother with My evidences/signs/verses, and do not weaken/relax in mentioning/remembering Me.
You (B) go to Pharaoh, that he truly, he tyrannized.
So you (B) say to him a lenient/flexible saying/opinion and belief, maybe/perhaps he mentions/remembers, or fears.
They (B) said: "Our Lord, that we truly fear that he hastens/abuses on us or that he tyrannizes."
He said: "Do not fear (B), that I am (E) with you (B), I hear/listen, and I see/understand."
So you (B) come to him, so you (B) say: We (E) are your Lord's two messengers, so send with us Israel's sons and daughters, and do not torture them, We had come to you with a sign/evidence from your Lord, and the greeting/safety/security on who followed the guidance."
We (E) had been inspired/transmitted to us that the torture (is) on who lied/denied/falsified and turned away. 
He said: "So who (is) your (B)'s Lord, you Moses?"
He said: "Our Lord (is) who gave/granted every thing its creation then He guided."
He said: "So what (about the) affair/condition (of) the first/beginning generations/centuries ?"
He said: "Its knowledge (is) at my Lord in a Book , my Lord does not misguide and nor forgets."
Who made/put for you the earth/Planet Earth spread , and He threaded/passed for you in it roads/means , and He descended from the sky water, so We brought out with it pairs/spouses from different/various plants.
Eat and graze/pasture your camels/livestock, that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to (owners) of the minds/reasoning/powers.
From it We created you, in it We return/repeat you, and from it We bring you out another once/again.
And We had shown him/made him understand from Our verses/evidences/signs all of it, so he denied/falsified and refused/hated.
He said: "Did you come to us to bring us out from our land/Earth with your magic/sorcery, you Moses?"
So we will come to you, with magic/sorcery equal/alike to it, so make/put between us and between you an appointment we do not break it, we and nor you, a place/position equally distanced/just .
He said: "Your appointment (is) day (of) the decoration/beauty/ornament, and that the people be gathered at sunrise/daybreak ."
So Pharaoh turned away, so he gathered/collected his plot/deceit then he came .
Moses said to them: "Your calamity/scandal/grief , do not fabricate/cut and split on (about) God lies/falsifications , so He destroys/uproots you with a torture, and who fabricated/cut and split had failed/despaired ."
So they disputed/quarreled their matter/affair between them, and they kept the secret conversation secret.
They said: "That those two (are) two magicians/sorcerers (E), they (B) want/intend that they (B) bring you out from your land/Earth with their (B)'s magic/sorcery, and they (B) go/eliminate with your way/religious approach/habit the best example.
So gather/collect your plot/deceit then come/bring (it in) a row/line , and had succeeded/won today who (is) defeated/overcame, and became dignified.
They said: "You Moses either that you throw , or that we be first who threw ."
He said: "Rather you throw ." So then their ropes/ties and their sticks/canes is imagined/believed to him from their magic/sorcery that it hastens/moves quickly .
So he felt inner horror/fear in himself hiddenly/secretly Moses.
We said: "Do not fear, that you, you are the highest/mightiest ."
And throw/throw away what (is) in your right (hand), it snatches/swallows quickly what they made/performed , truly they made/performed a magician's/sorcerer's plot/deceit/manipulation , and the magician/sorcerer does not succeed/win where/when he came/destroyed. 
So the magicians/sorcerers were thrown/thrown away prostrating, they said: "We believed with (in) Aaron's and Moses' Lord."
He said: "You believed to him before that I permit for you, that he truly (is) your biggest/greatest (E) who taught/instructed you the magic/sorcery, so I will cut off/sever (E) your hands and your feet from opposites (sides), and I will crucify you (E) in the palm trees' trunks/stems, and you will know (E) which of us (is) stronger (in) torture and more lasting ."
They said: "We will never/not prefer/choose you over what came to us from the evidences, and who created/brought us into being , so order/execute what you are ordering/executing but you (only) destroy/end this the life the present/worldly life."
We (E) believed with our Lord, to forgive for us our sins/mistakes and what you compelled/forced us on it from the magic/sorcery, and God (is) best and more remaining (everlasting).
That truly he, who comes (to) his Lord a criminal/sinner, so that to him (is) Hell he does not die in it and nor lives.
And who comes to Him believing, he had made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so those, for them the stages/degrees the high/elevated.
Treed gardens (as) eternal residence, the rivers/waterways flow/pass from beneath/below it, immortally/eternally in it, and that (is) who purified's/corrected's reward/reimbursement .
And We had inspired/transmitted to Moses that walk/move with My worshippers/slaves so strike/move adry a path/way in the sea/ocean , do not fear over taking/pursuit , and nor you (should) fear."
So Pharaoh followed them with his soldiers/warriors, so from the body of water covered/afflicted them what covered/afflicted them (so they drowned in the water).
And Pharaoh misguided his nation, and he did not guide.
You Israel's sons and daughters, We had saved/rescued you from your enemy and We promised you the mountain's right side/direction, and We descended on you the manna/sap , and the quail/amusement.
Eat from tasty/goodnesses what We provided for you, and do not tyrannize/exceed the limit in it, so My anger takes place/descends on you, and whom My anger descends on him, so he had fallen/dropped .
And that I am forgiving often/a forgiver (E) to who repented and believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds then was guided.
And what made you hurry/hasten on from your nation, you Moses?
He said: "They are, those on my track/trail, and I hurried/hastened to you, my lord, to approve/please (you)."
He said: "So We had tested your nation from after you, and Elsamerey misguided them."
So Moses returned to his nation, angry sorrowfully/angrily. He said: "My nation, did not your Lord promise you a good/beautiful promise, did the promise/contract become long/last long on you, or you wanted/intended that anger (be) placed on you from your Lord, so you broke my appointment?"
They said: "We did not break your appointment with our free will, and but we were burdened/made to carry  weights/burdens from the nation's decoration/beauty so we threw/hurled it, so as/like that Elsamerey/Samerey threw/threw away."
So he brought out for them a body (of) a (M) calf, for him (is a) moo/bellow , so they said: "This (is) your god, and Moses' god." So he forgot.
So do they not see/understand that it (does) not return to them a saying/words , and nor own/possess for them harm, and nor benefit/usefulness?
And Aaron had said to them from before: "You my nation, truly you were tested with it, and that (E) your Lord (is) the merciful, so follow me, and obey my order/command ."
They said: We will never/not leave/depart on it, devoting/dedicating until Moses returns to us."
He said: "You Aaron what prevented/forbid you when you saw/understood them misguided?"
That you not follow me, did you disobey my order/command?
He said: "You son of my mother, do not take/receive by my beard , and nor with my head, that I, I feared, that you say: 'You separated between Israel's sons and daughters, and you did not observe/guard my saying/word .'"
He said: "So what (is) your concern/matter you Samerey/Elsamerey ?"
He said: "I saw with what they did not see/know with it, so I grasped/clutched a handful/grasp from the messenger's trace/mark , so I discarded/rejected it, , and as/like that my self enticed/tempted for me."
He said: "So go/go away , so then for you in the life that you say: 'No touch/desperate need .'And that for you (is) an appointment you will never/not break it, and look/see to your God whom you continue/remain on him devoting/dedicating , we will burn him (E), then we will uproot and disperse/destroy him (E) in the body of water uprooting and dispersing/destruction ."
Truly your God (is) God who (there is) no god except Him, He widened over every thing (with) knowledge.
As/like that We narrator/inform on (to) you from information/news what had preceded , and We had brought to you from at Us a reminder/remembrance.
Who objected/opposed/turned away from it, so that he truly carries/bears (on) the Resurrection Day a weight/burden .
Immortally/eternally in it, and it became (an) evil/harmful weight/burden for them (on) the Resurrection Day.
A day the horn/bugle is being blown in and We gather the criminals/sinners (on) that day blind/blue .
They converse quietly between them, that you stayed/remained except ten.
We are more knowledgeable with what they say, when their best example (in a) method/path says: "That (E) you stayed/remained except a day."
And they ask/question you about the mountains , so say: "My Lord explodes/destroys it explosion/destruction."
So He leaves it a plain and safe land even/level . 
You do not see in it crookedness/indirectness and nor difference in elevation/fault .
(On) that day they follow the caller/requester, no crookedness/indirectness for it, and the voices/sounds silenced/humbled to the merciful, so you do not hear except whispering/quiet or subdued voices.
(On) that day the mediation does not benefit/become useful, except whom the merciful permitted/allowed for him, and accepted/approved for him a saying/word .
He knows what (is) between their hands and what (is) behind them, and they do not comprehend/envelope with (about) Him knowledge.
And the faces/fronts submitted/humbled to the live/alive , the of no beginning and self sufficient , and who had carried/bore injustice/oppression had failed/despaired .
And who makes/does from the correct/righteous deeds and he is believing, so he does not fear injustice/oppression, and nor anger/humiliation .
And as/like that We descended it (as) an Arabic Koran, and We laid out/detailed linguistically in it from the threat, maybe/perhaps they fear and obey, or it initiates/originates/informs for them a reminder/remembrance.
So high, mighty, exalted and dignified (is) God the owner/possessor/king, the truth , and do not hurry/hasten with the Koran from before that its transmission/revelation be carried out/executed to you, and say: "My Lord increase me knowledge."
And We had promised/recommended to Adam from before so he forgot, and We did not find decisiveness/determination for him.
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam." So they prostrated except Satan/Iblis refused/hated.
So We said: "You Adam, that (E) that (is) an enemy for you and to your wife/spouse, so let him not bring you (B) out from the Paradise, so you (will) be miserable/unhappy."
That (E) for you, that you do not starve/be hungry in it, and nor naked/obscenely harmed .
And that you do not be thirsty in it, and nor sun stricken/uncovered
So the devil inspired and talked to him, he said: "You Adam, do I guide you on (to) the immortality's/eternity's tree, and possession and free will/kingdom (that) does not wear out?"
So they ate from it, so their (B)'s shameful genital private parts to be covered appeared to them (B), and they (B) started and continued (to) stick (B) on them (B) from the Paradise's leaves , and Adam disobeyed his Lord, so he was misguided/failed.
Then His Lord chose/purified him, so He forgave on him, and guided.
He said: "You (B) descend/drop from it all together , some of you to some (you are to each other) an enemy, so when guidance from Me comes to you, so who followed My guidance, so he does not become misguided and nor become miserable/unhappy.
And who objected/turned away from My remembrance/reminder, so then for him (is a) narrow tight/weak life/livelihood , and We gather him (on) the Resurrection Day blind/confused .
He said: "My Lord why (have) you gathered me blind/confused and I had been seeing/understanding ?" 
He said: "Like that, Our verses/evidences/signs came to you so you forgot it, and like that today you be forgotten."
And like that We reimburse who extravagated/exceeded the limit, and did not believe with his Lord's verses/evidences , and the end's (other life's) torture (E) (is) stronger (severer) and more lasting (everlasting) .
Did He not guide to them how many from the generations/peoples of eras before them We made die/destroyed , they walk in their residences, that (E) in that (are) verses/evidences/signs (E) to (owners) of the minds/reasoning powers.
And was it not for a word/sermon preceded from your Lord, (it) would have been necessity/obligation and (a) named/identified term/time.
So you be patient on what they say, and praise/glorify with your Lord's praise/gratitude/thanks, before the sun's ascent/rising, and before its decline/setting , and from the night's hours so praise/glorify, and the daytime's ends/edges, maybe/perhaps you accept/approve.
And do not extend/spread your two eyes to what We gave long life/made enjoy with it (to) spouses/couples from them, the life the present's/worldly life's flower/splendor , to test them in it, and your Lord's provision (is) better and more lasting .
And order/command your family/people with the prayers and endure patience on it, We do not ask/question you (for) a provision/means of livelihood , We provide for you, and the end (result is) to the fear and obedience (of God).
And they said: "If only, he comes/brings to us with a verse/evidence/sign from his Lord." Did not an evidence (of) what is in the written leaves/sheets/pages (books/scriptures) the first/beginning come to them?
And if that (E) We destroyed/made them die with torture from before it, they would have said: "Our Lord, if only you sent to us a messenger, so we follow your signs/verses/evidences, from before that we humiliate/disgrace, and we shame/scandalize (ourselves)."
Say: "Each/all (is) waiting/remaining , so wait/remain , so you will know who (are) the road's/way's the straight/just owners/company , and who was guided." 
Their account/calculation neared/approached to the people, and they are in negligence/disregard objecting/opposing .
None from a remembrance/reminder initiated/originated from their Lord, comes to them except they heard/listened (to) it and (while) they are playing/amusing .
Their hearts/minds are being distracted and they kept the confidential talk secret, those who caused injustice/oppression, is that except (a) human similar/equal to you? Do you do the magic/sorcery and you are seeing/understanding?
He said: "My Lord knows the saying/opinion and belief in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable."
But they said: "A confused mixture of dreams with no basis, rather he fabricated/cut and split it, rather he is a poet, so he should come/bring us with a verse/evidence/sign, as/like the first/beginners were sent."
None from a village/urban city before them believed, (that) We made it die/destroyed it , so are they believing?
And We did not send before you except men, We inspire/transmit to them, so ask/question the reminder's/remembrance's people if you were not knowing.
And We did not make/create them a body, they do not eat the food, and they were not immortal/eternal .
Then We were truthful to them (in) the promise, so We saved/rescued them and whom We will/want, and We destroyed the wasters/extravagators .
We had descended to you a Book in it (is) your memory/mention , so do you not reason/understand?
And how many from a village/urban city We destroyed/broke , (it) was unjust/oppressive, and We created/formed after it a nation (of) others.
So when they felt with one of their physical senses Our might/power , then they are from it running (fleeing).
Do not run, and return to what you were luxuriated/ungrateful and arrogant in it and your residences, maybe/perhaps you be asked/questioned.
They said: "Oh our calam ity that we, we were unjust/oppressive."
So it was still/continuing that it (was) their call/prayer until We made them uprooted (and) silent/dead .
And We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) playing/amusing
If We wanted that We take a plaything/an amusement , We would have taken it from at Us, if We were making/doing.
Rather We throw/hurl with the truth on the falsehood, so it nullifies/eliminates it (the falsehood), so then it(the falsehood) is vanishing/being destroyed , and for you (is) the grief/misfortune from what you describe/categorize.
And for Him whom (is) between the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and whom (are) at Him do not be arrogant from worshipping Him, and they do not grieve/sadden .
They praise/glorify (during) the night and the daytime, they do not subside/abate .
Or they took/received gods from the earth/Planet Earth, they are reviving/resurrecting.
If (there) was in them (B) (the skies and the Earth) gods, except God, they (B) would have been corrupted ,so praise/glory (to) God, Lord (of) the throne about what they describe/categorize.
(He is) not to be asked/questioned about what He makes/does, and they are being asked/questioned.
Or they took/received from other than Him gods, say: "Bring/give your proof/evidence that (is a) reminder/mention what (is) with me, and (a) reminder/mention what (is) before me, but most of them do not know the truth , so they are objecting/opposing .
And We did not send from before you from a messenger, except (that) We inspire/transmit to him: "That He is no God except Me, so worship Me."
And they said: "The merciful took/received a child (son) His praise/glory but honoured worshippers/slaves."
They do not precede/race Him with the saying/opinion and belief, and they are with His order/command doing/working.
He knows what (is) between their hands and what (is) behind them, and they do not mediate except to who He accepted/approved, and they are from His fear are guarding/cautious .
And who says from them: "That I am a god from other than Him." So that/this, We reimburse him Hell, that is how We reimburse the unjust/oppressive."
Did those who disbelieved not see that the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, they (B) were joined , so We split/ruptured them (B) , and We made/created from the water every thing alive/living, so do they not believe?
And We made/created in the earth/Planet Earth anchors/mountains , that (E) it sways and leans/moves and unsettles with them, and We made/created in it wide mountain paths (as) roads/paths ,maybe/perhaps they be guided.
And We made/created the sky/space a protected/guarded roof/ceiling, and they are from its verses/evidences/signs objecting/opposing .
And He is who created the night and the daytime, and the sun and the moon, every/all in (an) orbit/circuit floating.
And We did not make/create to a human from before you the immortality , so if you died so they are the immortals ?
Every self (is) tasting/experiencing the death/lifelessness, and We test you with the bad/harm and the good/generosity (as) a test , and to Us you are being returned.
And if those who disbelieved saw you, that they take you except mockingly/making fun, is that who mentions/remembers your gods? And they are with mentioning/remembering the merciful they are disbelieving.
The human/mankind was created from hurry/haste/speed, I will show you My verses/evidences , so do not hurry/hasten .
And they say: "When (is) that the promise if you were truthful?"
If those who disbelieved know when they do not prevent/stop the fire from their faces/fronts, and nor from their backs, and nor they, they be given victory/aid.
But it comes to them suddenly/unexpectedly, so it amazes/surprises them, so they are not able (of) its return/returning it, and nor they be given time .
And had been mocked/made fun of with messengers from before you, so surrounded with those who mocked from them, what they were with it mocking (so those who mocked were surrounded by their deeds).
Say: "Who guards/protects you by the night and the daytime from the merciful? But they are from mentioning/remembering their Lord objecting/opposing .
Or (are) for them gods preventing/protecting them from other than/besides Us, (or are there Gods that protect them from Us), they are not able (of) victory/aid (to) themselves, and nor they are from Us being accompanied/befriended.
But We gave long life/made those enjoy, and their fathers, until the lifetime became long/lasted long on them, so do they not see/understand that We come/bring (to) the earth/Planet Earth, We reduce/decrease/lessen it from its ends/edges, so are they the defeaters/conquerors?
Say: "Truly I warn/give you notice with the inspiration/transmission , and the deaf does not hear the call/prayer if they are being warned/given notice! ."
And if a blow/breath from your Lord's torture touched them, they will say (E): "Oh our calamity , we (E) were unjust/oppressive."
And We put the scales/measures the just/equitable to the Resurrection Day, so a self does not be caused injustice to/oppressed a thing, and (even) if (it) was a seed's/grain's weight of mustard/an herb, We brought it and enough/sufficient with Us counting/calculating.
And We had given/brought (to) Moses and Aaron the Separator of Right and Wrong/Proof , and light/illumination , and a reminder/remembrance to the fearing and obeying.

And We had given Abraham his correct/right guidance from before, and We were with (about) him knowing.
When he said to his father and to his nation: "What (are) these the statues which you are to it devoting/dedicating ?"

He said: "You had been, you and your fathers in clear/evident misguidance."
They said: "Did you come to us with the truth , or you are from the playing amusing ?" 
He said: "But your Lord (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's Lord, who created them (B) ,and I am on that from the witnessing/testifying."
And by God, I will manipulate/fight/(destroy) (E) your idols/statues , after that you turn giving (your) backs.

He said: "But/rather their oldest/biggest , that, made/did it, so ask/question them, if they were speaking."
So they returned to themselves, so they said: "That you are, you are the unjust/oppressive."
Then they were turned upside down on their heads/tops, "You had known those do not speak."
He said: "Do you worship from other than God what does not benefit you a thing, and nor harm you?"
Ugh to you, and to what you worship from other than God, so do you not reason/comprehend ?
They said: "Burn him, and give victory/aid (to) your gods, if you were making/doing (that)."

And Zachary/Zacharias/Zachariah when he called/cried (to) his Lord: "My Lord do not leave me alone , and you are the heirs'/inheritants' best."

If those were gods, they would not (have) neared/approached it , and each/all (is) in it immortal/eternal .
For them in it (is the) sound of blazing or roaring fire , and they (are) in it not hearing/listening.
That those whom the best/goodness from Us preceded for them, those are from it they are being kept far away.
They do not hear its sound or noise, and they are in what their selves desired/craved immortal/eternal .
The fright/terror the greatest/biggest does not sadden/make them grievous, and the angels receive/meet them (and they are told): "This (is) your day/time which you are being promised."
A day/time We fold/coil the sky/space as/like the record/register book's folding/coiling to the books/scriptures (print); as/like We began/initiated (the) first/beginning creation, We repeat/return it, a promise on Us, We (E) were making/doing (it).
And We had written/decreed in The Book/Prophet David's Scripture from after the reminder/remembrance (could also be a sacred scripture or the Koran) that the earth/Planet Earth My worshippers/slaves the correct/righteous inherit it.
That in this (is) an information/communication to a nation worshipping.

And from the people, who argues/disputes in (about) God without knowledge, and He follows every rebellious/mutinous devil.
It was written/decreed on him that who followed him (the devil), that he (the devil) misguides him, and he (the devil) guides him to the torture, the blazing/inflamed.
You, you the people, if you were in doubt/suspicion from the resurrection/revival, so We created you from dust/earth, then from a drop/males' or female's secretion/little water, then from a blood clot/sperm/semen , then from a piece of something chew able of flesh or other evened/smoothed/kneadable, and other than (that) not evened/smoothed/kneadable, to clarify/explain to you, and We settle/establish in the wombs/uteruses what We will/want to a named/identified term/time, then We bring you out (as) a child/children, then to reach your maturity/strength, and from you who (is) made to die, and from you who is returned to the life time's worst/meanest , so that he not know from after knowledge a thing, and you see/understand the earth/Planet Earth quiet/lifeless , so if We descended on it the water, it shook/moved, and it grew/increased, and it sprouted/grew from every pair delightful/cheering .

Turning his neck violently objecting to misguide from God's way/path , for him in the present world (is) shame/scandal/disgrace, and We make him taste/experience (on) the Resurrection Day the burning's torture.
That (is) because (of) what your hands advanced/introduced , and that God is not with an unjust/oppressor to the worshippers/slaves.
And from the people who worships God on edge, so if goodness struck/marked him he became assured/secured with it, and if test/betrayal/torture struck/marked him, he returned on his face/front , he lost the present world and the end (other life), that (is) the loss/misguidance and punishment, the clear/evident .
He calls from other than God what does not harm him and what does not benefit him, that (is) the misguidance thefar/distant.

Do you not see that God prostrates to Him who (is) in the skies/space and who (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and the sun and the moon, and the stars/planets, and the mountains , and the trees, and the walkers/creepers/crawlers , and many of the people, and many became imminent/deserved on him the torture, and who God humiliates/disgraces/degrades so (there is) no honourer (supporter) for him, that God makes/does what He wills/wants .
Those two, two disputers/adversaries disputed/controverted/argued in their Lord, so those who disbelieved, clothes/garments/dresses were cut for them from fire, the hot/cold water is being poured from above their heads.
What is in their bellies/insides and the skins is being melted/anointed with it.
And for them (are) sticks from iron .
Whenever they wanted that they get out from it from (because of) sadness/depression, they were returned in it, and (told): "Taste/experience the burning's torture."

And when We established/assigned to Abraham the House/Home's place/position , that do not share/make partners with Me (in) a thing, and purify/clean My House/Home to the circlers/walkers around, and the standing/keeping up , and the bowing , and the prostrating.
And inform/announce in the people with (about) the pilgrimage, they come to you walking and on every lean/thin , they come from every deep/far/long mountain path .
To witness benefits/uses for them, and they mention/remember God's name in known days/times, on (for) what He provided for them from quadrupeds of land and sea excluding felines the camels/livestock, so eat from it, and feed the miserable/fallen in hardship, the poor/needy .
Then they should carry out/accomplish (remove/cleanse) their filth/dirt , and they should fulfill/complete their duties/vows (on themselves), and they should circle/walk around at the House/Home, the Honoured/Ancient .
That and who magnifies/makes great God's ordered prohibitions, so it is better for him at his Lord, and the camels/livestock is permitted/allowed for you, except what is being read/recited on (to) you, so avoid the obscenity/filth from the idols/idolized statues, and avoid the lie's/falsehood's word/opinion and belief .
Submitters/Unifiers of God to God not sharing/taking partners with Him, and who shares/makes partners with God, so as if/though he fell down from the sky/space, so the birds snatch him, or the wind/breeze falls/drops with him in a far and remote place/position.
That and who magnifies/makes great God's methods/ways of worship, so that it truly is from the hearts'/minds' fearing/obedience of God.
For you in it (are) benefits/uses to a named/identified term/time, then its place/destination (is) to the House/Home the Honoured/Ancient .
And to each/every nation We made/created a ritual or method of worship/familiar place , to mention/remember God's name on what He provided for them from quadrupeds of land and sea excluding felines the camels/livestock, so your God (is) one God, so to Him submit/surrender , and announce good news (to) the humble/tranquil.
Those whom if God was mentioned their hearts/minds became afraid/apprehensive, and the patient on what struck them , and the keeping up the prayers, and from what We provided for them they spend.
And the fattened camel/cow (for sacrifice), We made it for you from God's methods/ways of worship, for you in it (is) goodness , so remember/mention God's name on it (when it is) lined/arranged in a row, so if it fell down and died (was sacrificed and fell on) its sides, so eat from it and feed the humble asker that is content with little or much , and the poor/needy/poorest, as/like that We manipulated/subjugated it for you, maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
God will not take/receive its meat , and nor its blood, and but He takes/receives the fear and obedience from you, as/like that He manipulated/subjugated it for you to greaten/magnify God on what He guided you, and announce good news (to) the good doers.
That God defends on/about those who believed, that truly God does not love/like every/each betraying/being unfaithful (insistent) disbeliever. 
(It) was permitted/allowed/announced to those who fight/kill with that they are/were caused injustice to/oppressed, and that truly God (is) on giving them victory/aiding them capable/able (E).
Those who were brought/driven out from their homes/countries/places without (a) right/justice except that they say: "Our Lord (is) God." And were it not for God's pushing the people some of them with some elevated and secluded monasteries , and temples (for Jews and Christians), and prayers, and mosques/places of worshipping God, God's name is mentioned/remembered in it much, would have been demolished/torn down, and God will give victory/aid (E) (to) who gives Him victory/aid, that truly God (is) strong, glorious/mighty .

And if they deny you , so Noah's nation had denied before them, and Aad's and Thamud's .
And Abraham's nation, and Lot's nation.
And Madya's owners/company/friends, and Moses was denied , so I extended to the disbelievers in time/life , then I punished/took them, so how was My severity/change (anger)?
So how many from a village/urban city We made it die/destroyed it, and it is unjust/oppressive, so it is empty/destroyed on its ceilings/structures , and a well abandoned/inactive , and an erected/plastered castle/palace ?
Do they not walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth, so it (can) be for them hearts/minds they reason/comprehend with it, or ears they hear/listen with it, so that it truly does not blind/confuse the eye sights/knowledge and but that the hearts/minds which (are) in the chests (innermosts) blind/confuse (although they have eyes, they refuse to accept it).

And those who hurried/hastened disabling/frustrating in Our verses/evidences , those are the Hells' owners/company/friends.
And We did not send from before you from a messenger, and nor a prophet, except if/when he wished/desired, the devil threw in his wish/desire, so God erases/ nullifies what the devil throws , then God perfects/tightens His verses/evidences/signs, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
To make what the devil throws (as) a test/seduction to those whom in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease, and their hearts/minds (are) the cruel/merciless , and that the unjust/oppressive (are) in (E) far/distant defiance/animosity .

And those who disbelieved remain/continue in doubt from it until the Hour/Resurrection comes to them suddenly/unexpectedly, or a day/time of no good strong/infertile torture comes to them.

And He is who gave you life/revived you, then He makes you die, then He revives you/makes you alive, that the human (is an insistent) disbeliever (E).
To every/each nation We made/created a ritual or method of worship they are practicing the rituals or methods of worship , so they do not dispute/quarrel with you (E) in the matter/affair, and call to your Lord, that you are on (E) straight/direct guidance.
And if they argued/disputed with you, so say: "God (is) more knowledgeable with what you make/do ."

Do you not know that God knows what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth? That truly that (is) in a Book , that truly that (is) on God easy/little .
And they worship from other than God what He did not descend with it a proof/evidence, and what (there) is not for them with it knowledge, and (there is) no victorior/savior to the unjust/oppressive.
And if Our verses/evidences are read/recited on them, you know (recognize) in those who disbelieveds' faces/fronts the defiance of God and His orders/obscenity , they are about to/almost violently attack and assault with those who read/recite on (to) them Our verses/evidences , say: "Shall I inform you with worse/more harmful than that one, the fire , God promised it (to) those who disbelieved, and how bad (is) the end/destination?"
You, you the people, (an) example/proverb was given , so listen to it, that those whom you call from other than God they will never/not create a fly/insanity and even if they gathered/unified/combined for it, and if the fly/insanity ravishes/robs them forcefully (of) a thing, they will not rescue/save it from it, the seeker/wanter and the sought after/wanted were weakened.
They did not evaluate/estimate God His deserved/true value/estimation/capability , that truly God (is) powerful/strong (E), glorious/mighty .
God chooses/purifies from the angels messengers, and from the people, that truly God (is) hearing/listening, seeing/understanding .

And We had sent Noah to his nation, so he said: "You my nation, worship God, (there is) no God for you from other than Him, so do you not fear and obey?"
So said the nobles/assembly from those who disbelieved from his nation: "That (is) not except a human similar to you he wants that (he) makes himself more preferred/favoured on (to) you, and if God willed/wanted , He would have descended angels, we did not hear with that in our fathers/forefathers, the first/beginners."

So We inspired/transmitted to him: "That produce/manufacture the ship/ships with Our eyes/sights, and Our inspiration/revelation , so if Our order/command came, and the furnace/kiln/elten'noor boiled over/gushed, so enter/pass in it from every/each pair/couple two, and your family/people , except whom the words preceded on him from them, and do not address/converse with Me in (about) those who were unjust/oppressive, that they are being drowned/sunken."
And if/when you sat on/tended to and who (is) with you on the ship/ships, so say: 'The praise/gratitude/thanks (is) to God who saved/rescued us from the nation the unjust/oppressive.'
And say: "My Lord, descend me a blessed place of decent, and you are best (of) the senders of the descenders (host)."
That in that (are) evidences/signs (E), and if We were testing (E).
Then We originated/developed from after them people of one era/generation/century, others.
So We sent in (between) them a messenger from them: "That worship God, (there is) no God for you from other than Him, so do you not fear and obey?"
And the assembly/nobles from his nation those who disbelieved and denied/falsified with meeting the end (other life), and We blessed/luxuriated them in the life the present/worldly life said: "That is not except a human equal to you , he eats from what you eat from it, and he drinks from what you drink."
And if (E) you obeyed a human equal to you , that you are then losers (E).
Does he promise you, that you are if you died and you were dust/earth and bones, that you are being brought out?
How far/how impossible ? How far/how impossible to what you are being promised?
That truly it is except our life the present/worldly life, we die, and we live, and we are not with being resurrected/revived.
That he is except a man he fabricated/cut and split on (about) God lies/falsifications , and we are not to him with believing.
He said: "My Lord, give me victory/aid because (of) what they denied me ."
He said: "On what little (shortly) they (will) become/become in the morning regretful/remorseful ."
So the loud strong cry/torture raid punished/took them with the truth , so We made them rotten/useless , so a destruction/curse to the nation the unjust/oppressive.
Then We originated/developed from after them generations/peoples of eras/centuries, others.
None from a nation precedes its term/time and they do not delay/lag behind. 
Then We sent Our messengers successively/periodically , whenever a nation its messenger came to it, they denied him , so We made some of them follow some, and We made them information , so a destruction/curse to a nation they do not believe.
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our verses/evidences and an evident proof/evidence .
To Pharaoh, and his nobles/assembly , so they became arrogant and they were a high and mighty nation.
So they said: "Do we believe to two humans equal to us , and their (B)'s nation (are) to us worshipping?"
So they denied them (B) , so they were from the perished/destroyed .
And We had given/brought to Moses The Book , maybe/perhaps they be guided.
And We made Mary's son and his mother, an evidence/sign , and We sheltered them (B) to an elevated ground/hill of (with a) bottom and flowing easily and plentifully.
You, you the messengers, eat from the goodnesses , and make/do correct/righteous deeds, that I am with what you make/do knowledgeable.
And that this (is) your nation, one nation and I am your Lord so fear and obey Me.
So they separated their matter/affair (into) pieces every/each group/party with what (is) at them, they are happy/delighted .
So leave them in their ignorance/hatred until a time/period of time.
Do they think/suppose that We extend/spread them with it from property/possession/wealth and sons/sons and daughters?
We rush/quicken for them in the goodnesses/generosity, but they do not feel/know/sense.
That those who, they are from their Lord's fearing cautious/compassionate .
And those who, they are with their Lord's verses/evidences believing.
And those who, they are with their Lord, they do not share/make partners.
And those who give/bring what they gave/brought, and their hearts/minds (are) afraid/apprehensive that they are to their Lord returning.
Those, they speed/rush in the goodnesses/generosity, and they are to it racing/surpassing .
And We do not burden/impose (on) a self except its endurance/capacity and at Us (is) a Book (it) speaks/clarifies with the truth , and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
But their hearts/minds (are) in ignorance/intensity from this, and for them (are) deeds other than that, they are to it doing/working .
Until when We took/punished their luxuriated ungrateful and arrogant with the torture, then, where/when they cry aloud and humbly/pray.
Do not cry aloud and humbly/pray the day/today, that you are from Us not being given victory/aid.
My verses/evidences had been read/recited on (to) you, so you were on your heels returning/withdrawing.
Arrogantly conversing at night, you speak disgustedly/obscenely with (about) it.
Did they not consider/regulate the word/opinion and belief ? Or came to them what did not come (to) their fathers, the first/beginners? 
Or they did not know (recognize) their messenger, so they are to him denying/ignoring?
Or they say: "With him (is) insanity/madness." But he came to them with the truth , and most of them to the truth (are) hating.
And if the truth followed their self attractions for desires , the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and who (is) in them (B) would have (been) corrupted/destroyed , but We came/brought to them with their reminder, so they are from their reminder objecting/opposing .
Or you ask/question them (for) a royalty/retainer , so your Lord's royalty/retainer (is) best , and He is the provider's best .
And that you call them to a straight/direct road/way.
And that those who do not believe with the end (other life) are from the road/way deviating/siding away (E) .
And if We had mercy upon them, and We removed/uncovered (relieved) what (is) with them from harm, they would have persisted, excessed and insisted in their tyranny/arrogance being confused/puzzled .
And We had taken/punished them with the torture so they did not become humiliated/disgraced to their Lord, and they do not become humble and humiliate themselves.
Until when We opened on them a door/entrance of strong (severe) torture, then they are in it, they are confused/dumbfounded.
And He is who originated/developed for you the hearing/listening and the eye sights/knowledge, and the hearts , little (is) what you thank/be grateful.
And He is who created/seeded you in the earth/Planet Earth, and to Him you are being gathered.
And He is who revives/makes alive and makes die, and to Him the night's and the daytime's difference, so do you not reason/comprehend ?
But they said similar/equal (to) what the first/beginners said.
They said: "Is (it that) if we died, and we were dust/earth and bones, are we being resurrected/revived (E)?"
We had been promised this from before, we, and our fathers, that this (is) except the first's/beginner's myths/baseless stories .
Say: "To whom (is) the earth/Planet Earth and who (is) in it, if you were knowing?"
They will say: "To God." Say: "So do you not mention/remember ?"
Say: "Who (is) the seven skies' Lord, and the great throne's Lord?"
They will say: "To God." Say: "So do you not fear and obey?"
Say: "Who (is) with (in) His hand every thing's ownership , and He protects/defends, and is not (to) be protected/defended on him, if you were knowing?"
They will say: "To God," Say: "So how (do) you be bewitched/enchanted/corrupted ?"
But We came/brought/gave to them with the truth, and that they are lying/denying .
God did not take/receive from a child (son), and (there) was not from a god with Him, then each/every god would have gone with what he created, and some of them would have heightened/elevated over some, God's praise/glory about what they describe/categorize. 
Knower (of) the unseen/hidden and the testimony/presence , so (He is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified about what they share/make partners (with Him).
Say: "My Lord, if you show me what they are being promised."
My Lord, so do not make/put me in (between) the nation the unjust/oppressive.
And We (E) on that We show you what We promise them (are) capable/able (E) .
Push/repel the sin/crime with which it is best , We are more knowledgeable with what they describe/categorize.
And say: "My Lord, I seek protection by You from the devils' urges/suggestions .
And I seek protection by you, my Lord, that they attend/come to me.
Until when the death/lifelessness came to one of them, he said: "My Lord return me."
Maybe/perhaps I make/do correct/righteous deeds in what I left. No but it is a word/expression he is saying it, and from behind them (is) a barrier to a day/time they be resurrected/revived .
So if the horn/bugle was blown in, so (there are) no relations/kin between them (on) that day , and nor they ask/question each other.
So who his weights/measures became heavy, so those are the successful/winners.
And who his weights/measures were reduced/lightened, so those (are) those who lost themselves in Hell immortally/eternally.
The fire scorches/burns their faces/fronts, and they are in it gloomy/grim .
Were not My verses/evidences read/recited on (to) you, so you were with it lying/denying ?
They said: "Our Lord our misery/unhappiness defeated/overcame on us, and we were a misguided nation."
Our Lord, bring us out from it, so if we returned, so we are (then) unjust/oppressive.
He said: "Be despised/humiliated in it, and do not converse/speak (to) me ."
That it truly was a group from My worshippers/slaves saying: "Our Lord, we believed, so forgive for us and have mercy upon us, and you are best (of) the merciful."
So you took/received them mocking/ridiculing until they made you forget My remembrance/reminder and you were laughing/wondering from them.
That I rewarded/reimbursed them the day/today because (of) what they were patient, that they are, they are the winners/successful .
Say: "How much/many number/numerous years you remained in the earth/Planet Earth?"
They said: "We stayed/remained a day or part (of) a day , so ask/question the counting."
He said: "That truly that you stayed/remained except little , if that you were knowing."
Did you think/suppose , that We created you playfully and mockingly , and that you are not being returned to Us?
So high, mighty, exalted and dignified (is) God the king/owner/possessor, the truth/just , (there is) no God except Him, Lord (of) the throne , the honoured .
And who calls with God another god, (he has) no proof/evidence for him with it, so but his account/calculation (is) at his Lord, that He truly does not make the disbelievers succeed/win.
And say: "My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and you are best (of) the merciful." 
A chapter of the Koran , We descended it, and We made it a duty/commanded it , and We descended in it verses/evidences evidences, maybe/perhaps you mention/remember .
The adulteress/fornicatress (F) and the adulterer/fornicator (M) , so whip/lash each one from them (B) one hundred whip(s)/lash(es), and mercy/compassion does not take you with them (B) in God's religion/judgment , if you were believing by God and the day the last/Resurrection Day, and a group of people from the believers should witnessed their (B)'s torture.
The adulterer/fornicator does not marry except an the adulteress/fornicatress or a sharer/taker of partners (with God), and the adulteress/fornicatress , none marries her except an adulterer/fornicator or sharer/taker of partners (with God), and that (was) forbidden on the believers.
And those who blame and accuse the chaste/married then they did not come with witnesses/testifiers ,so whip/lash them eighty whip(s)/lash(es), and do not accept for them a testimony/certification , ever (E), and those are the debauchers .
Except those who repented from after that, and corrected/repaired , so then God (is) forgiving, merciful.
And those who blame and accuse their spouses , and (there) were not for them witnesses/testifiers except themselves, so testimony/certification (of) one of them, four testimonies/certifications by God that he truly is from (E) the truthful.
And the fifth that God's curse/torture (is) on him, if he was from the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
And pushes away/repels the torture from her that she witnesses/testifies four testimonies/certifications by God that he truly is from (E) the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
And the fifth, that God's anger (is) on her if he was from the truthful.
And where it not for God's grace/blessing on you and His mercy, and that God (is) forgiving, wise/judicious.
That those who came with the lies/falsehood a group/band/company from you, do not think/suppose it (is) bad/evil/harm for you, rather/but it is best for you to each/every human from them what he earned/gained from the sin/crime; and who followed his arrogance/great sin from them (there is) for him a great torture.
Where it not for when you heard it , the believers (M) and the believers (F) thought/assumed goodness with themselves, and they said: "That (is) evident lies/falsehood."
Unless they come on it with four witnesses/testifiers, so if they do not come with witnesses/testifiers, so those are at God they are the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
And where it not for God's grace/favour/blessing on you and His mercy in the present world and the end (other life), great torture would have touched you in what you flowed/spread in it.
When you receive it with your tongues/languages and you say with your mouths what knowledge is not for you with it (you have no knowledge of) and you think/suppose it (is) easy/light, and it is at God great.
And if only when you want/listened (to) it, you said: "It (is) not to be for us that we converse/speak with that, Your praise/glory, that (is) great falsehood/slander ."
God advises/warns you that you return to similar/equal to it ever, if you were believing.
And God clarifies/explains for you the verses/evidences , and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
That those who love/like that the enormous/atrocious deed spread/circulate in (between) those who believed, for them (is a) painful torture in the present world and the end (other life), and God knows, and you do not know.
And where it not for God's grace/favour/blessing on you and His mercy, and that God (is) compassionate/merciful, merciful.
You, you those who believed, do not follow the devil's foot steps, and who follows the devil's foot steps, so that he truly orders/commands with the enormous/atrocious deeds , and the defiance of God and His orders/obscenity , and where it not for God's grace/favour/blessing on you and His mercy (there would) not (be) from one from you ever (E) (that) purified/corrected , and but God purifies/corrects whom He wills/wants/intends, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
(Owners) of the grace/favour/blessing and the wealth/abundance from you do not slacken/relax , that they give/bring (those) of the relations/near, and the poorest of poor/poor oppressed, and the emigrants in God's sake/path , and to forgive/pardon, and they should forgive/pardon, do you not love/like that God forgives for you? And God (is) forgiving, merciful.
That truly those who blame and accuse the chaste/married , the neglecting/disregarding (F) , the believing (F), were cursed/humiliated in the present world, and the end (other life) and for them (is) a great torture.
A day/time their tongues , and their hands, and their feet witness/testify on them becuase (of) what they were making/doing .
That day God fulfills/completes (to) them their religion/reimbursement the truth , and they know that God, He is the truth , the clear/evident .
The cheaters/wicked (F) (are) to the cheaters/wicked (M) , and the cheaters/wicked (M) (are) to the cheaters/wicked (F) , and the good/pure (F) (are) to good/pure (M) , and the good/pure (M) (are) to the good/pure (F) , those are being made innocent/pure from what they are saying, for them (is) forgiveness and generous/kind (reimbursement).
You, you those who believed, do not enter houses/homes other than your houses/homes, until you perceive (seek permission), and you greet on (to) its family/people , that (is) best for you, maybe/perhaps you mention/remember .
So if you did not find in it anyone, so do not enter it until (it) be permitted/allowed for you, and if (it) was said to you: "Return." So return, it is more pure/correct for you, and God (is) with what you make/do knowledgeable.
An offense/guilt/sin is not on you that you enter houses/homes not resided in/inhabited, in it (is) enjoyment for you, and God knows what you show, and what you hide/conceal. 
Say to the believers (to) lower/humble from their eye sights , and they protect/safe keep from their genital parts between their legs, that is more pure/correct for them, that God (is) expert/experienced with what they make/do .
And say to the believers they (F) lower/humble from their eye sights, and they (F) protect/safe keep from their genital parts between their legs, and they do not show their decoration/beauty except what appeared/is visible from it, and they hold in place/sew (E) with their head covers/covers on their collar opening in clothes/chests , and they do not show their decoration/beauty except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband's fathers (fathers in-law), or their sons, or their husband's sons (step- sons), or their brothers, or their brother's sons (nephews), or their sisters' sons (nephews), or their women, or what their right (hands) owned/possessed (i.e. care-giers under contract), or the followers/servants (those) not (owners) of need/desire/intelligence and resourcefulness (without a sexual drive) from the men or the child/children (the very old or very young), those who did not see and know of on the women's shameful genital parts , and they (F) do not beat/strike with their (F) feet to be known what they (F) hide from their decoration/beauty , and repent to God all together , oh you the believers, maybe/perhaps you succeed/win.
And marry the widows/widowers from you, and the correct/righteous from your slaves/servants and your owned (F) slaves, if they be poor/needy God enriches/suffices them from His grace/favour/blessing, and God (is) rich/spread , knowledgeable.
And those who do not find marriage should refrain/be chaste until God enriches/suffices them from His grace/favour/blessing, and those who ask/wish/desire the destiny/fate/term (marriage) from what your rights owned/possessed, so write with them (marry them), if you knew goodness in them, and give/bring them from God's property/possession/wealth which He gave you, and do not compel/force your young women/(F) youths on (to) the prostitution, if they (F) wanted/intended chastity, to desire the life the present's/worldly life's vanities/non-essentials, and who compels/forces them (F), so then God (is) from after their having been compelled/forced, forgiving, merciful.
And We had descended to you verses/evidences evident, and an example/proverb from those who past/expired from before you, and an advice/warning to the fearing and obeying.
God (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's light, His light's example/proverb (is) as/like a niche in it a light/lamp, the light/lamp (is) in a clear and transparent glass container , the clear and transparent glass container is as though it (is) a pearly/luminous star/planet, (it) is being ignited/lit from a blessed tree, an olive not eastern and not western, its oil is about to/almost to lighten/illuminate, and even if fire did not touch it. Light on/over light, God guides to His light whom He wills/wants , and God gives the examples/proverbs to the people, and God (is) with every thing knowledgeable.
In houses/homes God permitted/allowed that (it) be raised/honoured and be mentioned/remembered in it his name; praises/glorifies to Him in it at the early morning and the evenings to sunsets.
Men commercial trade and nor selling/trading does not distract/divert them from mentioning/remembering God, and keeping up the prayers and giving/bringing the charity/purification , they fear a day/time the hearts/minds and the eye sight/knowledge turns around in it.
(For) God to reward/reimburse them best (of) what they made/did , and He increases them from His grace/favour/blessing , and God provides for whom He wills/wants without counting/calculating.
And those who disbelieved their deeds (are) as a mirage at a plain land (desert) the thirsty thinks/supposes it (is) water, until when he came to it, he did not find it a thing, and he found God at it, so He fulfilled/completed him his account/calculation, and God (is) fast/quick (in) the counting/calculating.
Or as darknesses in a wide roaring and noisy sea/ocean , waves/surges cover/darken him/it , from above it waves/surges, from above it clouds, darknesses, some of it (is) above some, if he brought out his hand he is not about to/almost see it, and who God did not make/put for him light, so (there is) none from light (is) to/for him.
Do you see/understand that God praises/glorifies for Him whom (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and birds (with) expanded and motionless wings in a row? Each had known its prayers and its praise/glorification, and God (is) knowledgeable with what they make/do.
And to God (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/kingdom , and to God (is) the end/destination.
Do you not see/understand that God drives/eases gently clouds, then He unites/joins between it, then He makes it piled/accumulated , so you see the rain emerges from in between and around it, and He descends from the sky from mountains in it from hail , so He strikes with it whom He wills/wants , and He diverts it from whom He wills/wants, its lightning's shine/flash almost eliminates with the eye sights/knowledge.
God turns the night and the daytime, that truly in that (is) an example/warning (E) to (those) of the eye sights/knowledge.
And God created every/each walker/creeper/crawler from water, so from them who walks (moves) on its belly , and from them who walks on two feet, and from them who walks on four, God creates what He wills/wants , that truly God (is) on every thing capable/powerful .
We had descended verses/evidences evident, and God guides whom He wills/wants to a straight/direct road/way .
And they say: "We believed by God and with the messenger, and we obeyed." Then a group from them turns away from after that, and those are not with the believers.
And if they were called to God and His messenger to judge/rule between them, then a group from them (are) objecting/opposing .
And if the truth/right (is) for them, they come to Him submissive/obedient .
Is there in their hearts/minds sickness/disease, or they became doubtful/suspicious, or they fear that God and His messenger be unfair/inequitable on (to) them? But those are the unjust/oppressive.
But the believers' word/opinion and belief if they were called to God and His messenger to judge/rule between them was that they say: "We heard/listened and we obeyed." And those are the successful/winners.
And who obeys God and His messenger, and fears God, and fears and obeys Him, so those are the successful/triumphant .
And they swore/made oath by God their rights'/oaths' utmost , if (E) you ordered/commanded them they will get out (E), say: "Do not swear/make oath, known obedience, that God (is) expert/experienced with what you make/do ."
Say: "Obey God and obey the messenger." So if they turned away, so but on him what he was made to carry ,and on you what you were made to carry , and if you obey him/Him you will be guided, and nothing (is) on the messenger except the information/communication, the clear/evident ."
God promised those who believed from you, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, He makes them successors in the earth/Planet Earth, as He made successors those from before them, and to highly position/strengthen (E) for them their religion which He accepted/approved for them, He will exchange/replace them (E) safety/security from after their fear/fright, they worship Me, they do not share/made partners with Me a thing, and who disbelieved after that, so those are the debauchers .
And keep up the prayers, and give/bring the charity/purification , and obey the messenger, maybe/perhaps you attain mercy.
Do not think/suppose those who disbelieved (are) disabling/frustrating in the earth/Planet Earth, and their shelter/refuge (is) the fire , and how bad (E) (is) the end/destination?
You, you those who believed, those who your rights (hands) owned/possessed (i.e. care-givers under contract), and those who did not reach the puberty/sexual maturity from you should ask for your permission three times, from before the dawn's prayers, and when you put your clothes/garments (on) from the noon/midday, and from after the evening/first darkness prayers, three shameful genital parts (protective times are) for you, an offense/sin is not on you, and nor on them after them (the three times) circling/walking around on you, some of you to some, as/like that God clarifies/shows/explains for you the verses/evidences , and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
And if the children from you reached the puberty/sexual maturity so they should ask for permission/pardon, as/like those from before them asked for permission/pardon, as/like that God clarifies/shows/explains for you His verses/evidences , and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
And the menopausal/non child bearing from the women, those who do not hope/expect marriage, so an offense/guilt/sin is not on them (F) that they put (on) their clothes/garments not showing off beauty/decoration with decoration/ornament , and that they be chaste/pure (is) best for them, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
Blame/hardship (is) not on the blind, and nor on the lame/limper (from) blame/hardship , and nor on the sick/diseased (from) blame/hardship , and nor on yourselves that you eat from your houses/homes, or your fathers'/forefathers' houses/homes, or your mothers' houses/homes, or your brothers' houses/homes, or your sisters' houses/homes, or your paternal uncles' houses/homes, or your paternal aunts' houses/homes, or your maternal uncles' houses/homes, or your maternal aunts' houses/homes, or what you owned/possessed its keys ,or your friend, an offense/guilt/sin (is) not on you that you eat all together or separately, so if you entered houses/homes, so greet on yourselves a greeting from at God, blessed, pure ; as/like that God clarifies/shows/explains to you the verses/evidences , maybe you reason/comprehend .
But the believers (are) those who believed by God and His messenger, and if they were with Him on (a) gathering and important matter/affair, they do not go/go away until they ask for his permission/pardon, that those who ask for your permission/pardon, those are, those who believe by God and His messenger, so if they asked for your permission/pardon for some (of) their affair/concern , so permit/allow to whom you willed/wanted from them, and ask God for forgiveness for them, that God (is) forgiving, merciful.
Do not make calling the messenger between you as calling some of you (to) some, God had been know(ing) those who sneak/slip away taking refuge/dodging from you, so those who differ/disagree from His order/command should be warned/cautious that misguidance/seduction or a painful torture strikes them .
Is it not that to God what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth? God has been know(ing) what you are on it, and a day/time they be return(ed) to Him, so He informs them with what they made/did, and God (is) with every thing knowledgeable. 
Blessed (is) Who descended the Separator of Right and Wrong/Koran/Torah on (to) His worshipper/slave to be a warning/notice to the creations all together/(universes).
Who, for Him (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership and (He) did not take a child (son) , and a partner was not for Him in the ownership , and He created every thing so He predestined it predestination.
And they took from other than Him gods, they do not create a thing, and they are being created, and they do not own/possess to themselves harm, and nor benefit/usefulness , and they do not own/possess death/lifelessness, and nor life , and nor revival/resurrection.
And those who disbelieved say: "That that (is) except lies/falsehood he fabricated/cut and split it, and a nation (of) others helped/assisted him on it." So they had come unjustly/oppressively and falsely .
And they said: "The first's/beginner's myths/baseless stories , he wrote it, so it is being dictated on (to) him early mornings and evening to sunset ."
Say: "Who knows the secret in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth descended it, that He truly is/was forgiving, merciful."
And they said: "What to that (what is the matter) the messenger, he eats the food and walks in the markets, if only an angel was descended to him, so he (the angel) becomes a warner with him."
Or a treasure be thrown to him, or a treed garden/paradise be for him, he eats from it. And the unjust/oppressive said: "That you follow except a bewitched/enchanted man."
See how they gave to you the examples/proverbs, so they were misguided, so they are not being able (of) a way/path .
Blessed (is) who, if He willed/wanted He made/created for you better than that, treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways run/flow from below/beneath it, and He makes/puts for you castles/palaces .
But they denied with the Hour/Resurrection , and We prepared to who denied with the Hour/Resurrection blazing/inflaming (fire).
If it saw them from a far/distant place/position , they heard/listened to it a rage/anger and (the) sound of roaring fire .
And if they were thrown from it (to) a narrow/tight place/position tied to each other, at that time and place they called (for) destruction and grief .
Do not call today (for) one destruction and grief , and call (for) many destruction(s) (and) grief(s).
Say: "Is that better or the immortality's/eternity's treed garden/paradise which was promised (to) the fearing and obeying, (it) was for them a reward and an end/destination."
For them in it what they will/want immortally/eternally, (it) was on your Lord a questioned promise.
And a day/time He gathers them and what they worship from other than God, so He says: "Are you, you (who) misguided those My worshippers/slaves ? Or they misguided (from) the way/path ?"
They said: "Your praise/glory (it) was, ought not (be) to us that we take from other than You from guardians/allies . And but you made them enjoy and their fathers, until they forgot the reminder, and they were a destroyed/failed nation."
So they had denied you because (of) what you say, so you do not be able (of) diversion and nor a victory/aid , and who causes injustice/oppresses from you, We make him taste/experience a great torture.
And We did not send from before you from the messengers except that they truly eat (E) the food and they walk in the markets, and We made/put some of you to some (as) a test/seduction , would you be patient? And your Lord was/is seeing/knowing .
And those who do not hope/expect meeting Us said: "If only angels were descended on (to) us, or we see our Lord." They had become arrogant in themselves, and they became arrogant/disobedient, great arrogance/disobedience.
A day/time they see the angels: "(There is) no good news that day to the criminals/sinners ." And they say: "Confinement/obstruction fortified/in custody ."
And We came/tended to to what they made/did from (a) deed, so We made it scattered/spread dust.
The Paradise's owners/company (at) that day (are in a) best settlement , and better place of resting or sleeping at midday.
And a day/time the sky/space splits/cracks open with the clouds, and the angels were descended descent.
The ownership/kingdom, the truth (on) that day (is) to the merciful, and (it) was on the disbelievers a difficult/distressing day/time .
And a day/time the unjust/oppressor bites on his hands, he says: "Oh I wish I would have taken/received with the messenger a way/road ."
Oh my calamity, I wish I did not take so and so (as) a faithful, close friend .
He had misguided me from the reminder after when (it) came to me. And the devil was to the human/mankind a disaster/letting down ."
And the messenger said: "You my Lord, that my nation took this the Koran deserted/abandoned ."
And as/like that We made/put to every/each prophet an enemy from the criminals/sinners , and enough/sufficient with your Lord guiding and a victorior/savior .
And those who disbelieved said: "If only the Koran was descended on (to) him once in entirety ." Like that to strengthen with it your heart and We compiled (it) well/read or recited slowly, distinctly and clearly , good composition/slow, distinct and clear reading or recitation .
And they do not come to you with an example except We came to you with the truth and (a) better explanation/interpretation .
Those who are being gathered on their faces/fronts to Hell , those are (in a) worst place/position, more misguided (in) a way/road .
And We had (E) given/brought Moses The Book , and We made/put with it, his brother Aaron (as) a minister/supporter .
So We said: "Go/go away (B) to the nation those who lied/denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences ."So We destroyed them destruction/destructively.
And Noah's nation when they lied/denied/falsified the messengers, We drowned/sunk them, and We made them to the people (as) an evidence/sign , and We prepared to the unjust/oppressors, a painful torture.
And Aad , and Thamud , and the Riss's/old well's friends/company , and many generations/centuries between that.
And each/all We gave to it the examples/proverbs, and each/all We destroyed/ruined destruction/ruin .
And they had come/passed by on (to) the village/urban city which was rained the fire's/harm's rain, where they not being seeing it? But they were not hoping/expecting revival/resurrection.
And if they saw you, that they take you except mockingly/making fun: "Is that who God sent (as) a messenger?"
That he was about to/almost to misguide us from our gods, except for that we were patient on it. And they will know when they see/understand the torture who (is) more misguided a way/path .
Did you see who took/received his god (as) his self attraction for desire , so do you be on him a guardian/ally?
Or you think/suppose that most of them hear/listen or reason/comprehend , that they are except as the camels/livestock, but they are more misguided (in) a way/path .
Do you not see to your Lord how He extended/spread the shade ? And if He willed/wanted, He would have made it still/motionless, then We made/put the sun on it (as) a proof/evidence.
Then We grasped it to Us easy grasping .
And He is who made/put for you the night (as) a cover/dress, and the sleep (for) rest/sleep , and He made/put the daytime (for) revival .
And He is who sent the winds/breezes (as) a good news between His mercy's hand, and We descended from the sky pure/clean water.
To revive with it a dead/lifeless country/land , and We give it drink from what We created (from) camels/livestock and many humans/people.
And We had purified it/detailed it linguistically between them (so) they mention/remember , so most of the people refused/hated except (insistent) disbelief.
And if We willed/wanted, We would have sent in every village/urban city a warner/giver of notice .
So do not obey the disbelievers and struggle against them with it great struggling/defending for the faith.
And He is who mixed/set loose the two large bodies of water that (is) fresh/delightful very sweet/fresh, and that is salty salty and bitter, and He made/put between them (B) a barrier and (an) obstruction obstructed . 
And He is who created from the water a human so He made/put him a relationship/kinship and relations through marriage, and your Lord was/is capable/able/overpowering .
And they worship from other that God what does not benefit them, and nor harms them, and the disbeliever was/is on (against) his Lord a supporter/helper.
And We did not send you except (as) an announcer of good news and a warner .
Say: "I do not ask/demand of you on it from a wage/fee except who willed/wanted that he takes to His Lord a way/path ."
And rely/depend on the alive/live who does not die, and praise/glorify with His praise/gratitude , and enough/sufficient with Him, with His worshippers'/slaves' crimes (as) an expert/experienced.
Who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what is between them both in six days, then He aimed/tended to on the throne , the merciful, so ask/question with Him (about) an expert/experienced.
And if (it) was said to them: "Prostrate to the merciful." They said: "And what (is) the merciful? Do we prostrate to what you order/command us?" And (it) increased them hastening away with aversion.
Blessed (is) who made/put in the sky/space constellations and He made/put in it a lamp (light) and a luminous moon .
And He is who made/put the night and the daytime different/succeeding (one another) to who wanted that he remembers or wanted gratefulness .
And the merciful's worshippers/slaves (are) those who walk on the land/earth quietly/tranquilly , and if the lowly/ignorant conversed with them , they said: "Greeting/peace ."
And those who spend the night to their Lord prostrating and keeping up .
And those who say: "Our Lord divert from us Hell's torture, that truly its torture was/is destruction ."
That it truly was bad/harmful a settlement/establishment and residence.
And those who if they spent, they did not waste/extravagate and they did not tighten/restrict and economize, and was (were) between that just .
And those who do not call with God another god, and they do not kill the self that God forbade except with the right/just , and they do not commit adultery/fornication , and who makes/does that, he meets/finds (a) sins' punishment/compensation .
The torture be doubled/multiplied for him (on) the Resurrection Day, and he be immortal/eternal in it, humiliated/disgraced .
Except who repented and believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so those God exchanges/substitutes their sins/crimes (by) goodnesses, and God was/is forgiving, merciful.
And who repented and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so that he truly repents to God repentance .

And those who say: "Our Lord grant/present us from our spouses and our descendants eyes'/sight's delight/satisfaction , and make/put us to the believers (as) an example ."
Those, they are being rewarded/reimbursed the chamber/elevated stage because (of) what they were patient, and they will receive in it a greeting and a greeting/peace .
Immortally/eternally in it, (it) became a good/beautiful position/settlement and residence .
Say: "My Lord does not care/bother with you, where it not for your call/prayer so you had lied/denied/falsified, so (your punishment) will be (a) necessity/obligation ." 
T S M .
Those are The Book's, the clear/evident verses/evidences .
Maybe/perhaps you (are) exhausting/destroying yourself from anger that they not be believing.
If We want We descend on them from the sky an evidence/sign , so their necks continued/became to it bending/leaning .
And none from a reminder initiated/originated from the merciful comes to them except they were from it objecting/opposing .
So they had lied/denied/falsified so (the) news/information (of) what they were with it mocking/making fun of, will come to them.
Do they not see to the earth/Planet Earth how many/much We sprouted/grew in it from every/each generous pair .
That in that (is) an evidence/sign (E) , and most of them were not believing.
And that your Lord He is (E) the glorious/mighty , the merciful.
And when Moses called/cried (to) your Lord that: "Come/bring the nation the unjust/oppressive."
Pharaoh's nation, do they not fear and obey?
He said: "My Lord, that I, I fear that they deny me .
And my chest narrows/tightens and my tongue/speech does not speak/clarify, so send to Aaron .
And for them on (against) me (is) a crime, so I fear that they kill me.
He said: "No but, so you (B) go/go away with Our verses/evidences/signs, that We are with you hearing/listening."
So you (B) come to Pharaoh, so say (B): 'That we are messenger(s) (of) the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.'
'That send with us Israel's sons and daughters.'
He said: "Did we not bring you up in (between) us (as) a child/new born, and you stayed/remained in (between) us years from your lifetime?"
And you made/did your one deed/act which you made/did, and you are from the disbelievers.
He said: "I made/did it then, and (while) I am from the misguided."
So I escaped/fled from you when I feared you, so my Lord granted for me judgment/rule, and He made/put me from the messengers.
And that is a blessing/goodness you brag/remind me repetitiously of , that you enslaved Israel's sons and daughters.
Pharaoh said: "And what (is) the creations all together's/(universes') Lord?"
He (Moses) said: "Lord (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and what (is) between them (B), if youwere sure/certain."
He (Pharaoh) said to whom (was) around/surrounding him: "Do you not hear/listen?"
He (Moses) said: "Your Lord, and your first/beginning father's/forefather's Lord."
He (Pharaoh) said: "That your messenger who was sent to you (is) mad/insane (E)."
He (Moses) said: "Lord (of) the sunrise/east and the sunset/west and what (is) between them (B) if you were reasoning/comprehending ."
He (Pharaoh) said: "If (E) you took/received a god other than me, I will make you (E) from the imprisoned/prisoners."
He (Moses) said: "Even if I came to you with a clear/evident thing."
He (Pharaoh) said: "So come/bring with it if you were from the truthful."
So he threw/threw away his stick/cane, so then it is (a) clear/evident snake.
And he removed/pulled his hand so then it is white to the lookers/seers .
He said to the nobles/assembly around/surrounding him, that, that (is) a knowledgeable magician/sorcerer (E):
He wants/intends that he brings you out from your land with his magic/sorcery, so what (do) you order/command?
They said: "Delay/postpone him and his brother and send in the villages/urban cities gatherers."
They come to you with every knowledgeable magician/sorcerer.
So the magicians/sorcerers were gathered/collected to a known appointed place day/time .
And (it) was said to the people: "Are you gathering/uniting?
Maybe/perhaps we follow the magicians/sorcerers, if they, they were, the defeaters .
So when the magicians/sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh: "Is for us a reward/wage/fee (E) if we, we were the defeaters ?"
He said: "Yes and you are then from (E) the neared/closer."
Moses said to them: "Throw/throw away what you are throwing/throwing away."
So they threw/threw away their ropes/ties and their sticks/canes, and they said: "With Pharaoh's glory/might ,that we, we are the defeaters ."
So Moses threw/threw away his stick/cane, so then it snatches/swallows quickly what they lie/falsify.
So the magicians/sorcerers were thrown/thrown away prostrating.
They said: "We believed with the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
Moses' Lord and Aaron's.
He said: "You believed to him before that I permit/allow for you, that he truly is your greatest/teacher and leader (E) who taught/instructed you the magic/sorcery, so you will/shall (E) know I will cut off/sever (E) your hands and your feet from opposites (sides), and I will crucify you/place you on crosses (E) all/all together."
They said: "No harm/pain , that we to our Lord are returning ."
That we wish/hope/covet that our Lord forgives for us our sins/mistakes , that we were first (of) the believers.
And We inspired/transmitted to Moses that: "Travel/depart at night with My worshippers/slaves, that you are being followed."
So Pharaoh sent in the cities/towns gatherers (who said):
That, those (are) a small group/portion (E) few/little.
And that they truly are for us angering/enraging (E).
And that we (E) (are) all together (E) cautious .
So We brought them out from treed gardens/paradises and water springs/wells.
And treasures/buried treasures and (an) honoured/generous position/status.
As/like that, and We made it be inherited (to) Israel's sons and daughters.
So they followed them at sunrise.
So when the two groups/gatherings saw each other, Moses' friends/company said: "That we are being caught up/overtaken (E) ."
He said: "No but that truly with me (is) my Lord, He will guide me."
So We inspired/transmitted to Moses that: "Beat/strike/move with your stick/cane the sea/large body of water ." So it broke in half/split open/cracked, so every/each part/piece was as the huge mountain, the great.
And We advanced/brought near the others/lasts there at the same time or place (We made them almost catch up).
And We saved/rescued Moses and who (is) with him all/all together.
Then We drowned/sunk the others .
That in that (is) an evidence/sign (E) , and most of them were not believing.
And that your Lord He is (E) the glorious/mighty, the merciful.
And read/recite on (to) them Abraham's information/news.
When He said to his father and his nation: "What (do) you worship?"

He said: "Do they hear/listen to you when/if you call?"
Or they benefit you or they harm?
They said: "But we found our fathers as/like that they make/do ."
He said: "Did you see/understand what you were worshipping?"
You and your fathers/forefathers the eldest/old/ancient .
So they truly are an enemy to me except the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.

They said and (while) they are in it disputing/arguing :
By God, that truly we were in clear/evident misguidance.
When/if we make you equal with the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
And none except the criminals/sinners misguided us.
So (there are) none for us from mediators.
And nor a concerned friend.

And they disbelieved and denied with it, and their selves became sure/certain of it, unjustly/oppressively and height, might and dignity, so look/see how was the corruptings' end/turn (result).
And We had (E) given David and Soliman knowledge, and they (B) said: "The praise/gratitude (is) to God who preferred/favoured us over many from His slaves/worshippers , the believers."
And Soliman inherited David, and he said: "You, you the people we had been taught the birds' speech (language)/logic, and we were given from every thing, that truly that it is (E) the grace/favour/blessing , the clear/evident ."
And was gathered for Soliman his soldiers/warriors from the Jinns and the human/mankind, and the birds, so they are being restrained/apportioned (mobilized).
Until when they passed by the ants' valley, an ant said: "You, you the ants, enter your residences, (let) not Soliman and his warriors smash/destroy you (E) and they are not feeling/sensing
So he smiled laughing/wondering from its saying/word, and he said: "My Lord, inspire/influence me that I thank/be grateful (for) your blessing which you blessed on me and on my parents, and that I make/do correct/righteous deeds You accept/approve it, and enter me with Your mercy in (between) Your worshippers/slaves the correct/righteous."
And he seeked/searched the bird/birds , so he said: "Why (it is) not for me, I do not see the hoopoe bird/clucking bird , or he was from the absent? I will torture him strong (severe) torture."
I will slaughter it (E) , or it comes/brings to me (E) with a proof/evidence clear/evident .
So it waited/remained not far/distant, so it said: "I became aware/enveloped with what you did not become aware (of)/envelope with it, and I came to you from Sheba with sure/certain news/information."
That I found a woman, she owns/rules them, and she was given from every thing, and for her (is) a great throne .
I found her and her nation prostrating to the sun, from other than God, and the devil decorated/beautified for them their deeds , so he prevented/obstructed them from the way/path , so they do not be guided.
Do they not prostrate to God who brings out the hidden/concealed in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and he knows what you hide, and what you declare/publicize ?
God, no God except Him, Lord (of) the throne , the great.
He said: "We will look/see , had you been truthful, or you were from the liars/falsifiers ."
Go/take away , with my Book/letter/message, this, so throw it to them, then turn away from them, so look/see what they return .
She said: "You, you the nobles/assembly , that I , was/is thrown to me (an) honoured/generous Book ."
That it truly is from Soliman, and that it truly is by God's name the merciful, the most merciful .
That do not become high, mighty and dignified over me, and come to me (as) Moslems/submitters .
She said: "You, you the nobles/assembly , give me your opinion in my matter/affair/order/command, I was not deciding a matter/affair/order/command until you witness/testify."
They said: "We are (owners) of power/strength, and (owners) of strong (severe) courage/might/power, and the matter/affair/order/command (is) to you, so think about what you order/command."
She said: "That truly the kings if they entered a village/urban city they corrupted it and they made/put its more dignified/honoured people , humiliated/disgraced , and as/like that they make/do ."
And that I am sending to them with a present, so (then I am) looking/considering with what the messengers return.
So when (he) came (to) Soliman, he said: "Do you extend/spread me with property/wealth ? So what God gave me, (is) better than what He gave you, but you with your present, you be happy ." 
Return to them, so we will come to them (E) with soldiers (there is) no power/ability for them with it, and we will drive them out (E) from it humiliated/disgraced , and (while) they are subservient .
He (Soliman) said: "You, you the nobles/assembly, which of you brings/comes to me with her throne ,before that they come to me Moslems/submitters ?"
A wicked/manipulator from the Jinns said: "I come/bring to you with it before that you stand/get up from your place/position, and that I am on it powerful/strong (E), faithful/loyal ."
Who (is) at him knowledge from The Book said: "I come/bring to you with it before that your eye lid returns to you (you blink)." So when he saw it established/affixed at him, he said: "This (is) from my Lord's grace/favour/blessing, to test me do I thank/be grateful, or I disbelieve, and who thanked/became grateful, so but he thanks/becomes grateful for his self, and who disbelieved, so then my Lord (is) rich, honoured/generous ."
He said: "Change/disguise for her, her throne , we see is she to be guided or she becomes from those who do not be guided."
So when she came, (it) was said: "Is your throne like this?" She said: "As if it, it is." And we were given the knowledge from before her, and we were Moslems/submitters. .
And what she was worshipping from other than God obstructed/prevented her , that she truly was from a disbelieving nation.
(It) was said to her: "Enter the palace/tower ." So when she saw it, she thought/supposed it (was) a wide body of water , and she removed/uncovered from her two shins/legs, he said: "That it truly is a palace/tower smoothened and spread from clear glass/mirrors ." She said: "My Lord , that I caused injustice/oppression (to) myself, and I submitted/surrendered with Soliman, to God, the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
And We had sent to Thamud their brother Saleh : "That worship God, so then they are two groups/parties disputing/controverting .
He said: "You my nation, why (do) you hasten/urge with the sin/crime before the good/goodness? If only you ask God for forgiveness, maybe/perhaps you attain mercy."
They said: "We had a bad omen with you (you are a bad omen to us), and with whom (is) with you." He said: "Your omen (fate/future is) at God, but you are a nation being tested/misguided ."
And in the city/town were nine groups/tribes corrupting/disordering in the earth/Planet Earth, and they do not correct/repair .
They said: "Swear/make oath (to each other) by God: 'We will attack him suddenly at night (E) and his people/family , then we will say (E) to his guardian/ally , we did not witness his people's/family's death/destruction , and we are (E) truthful (E).' "
And they schemed , a scheme and We schemed a scheme , and (while) they are not feeling/knowing/sensing.
So look/see/wonder about how was their scheme's end/turn (result), that We (E), We destroyed them, and their nation all/all together. 
So those are their houses/homes destroyed/unoccupied because (of) what they caused injustice/oppression, that in that (is) an evidence/sign (E) to a nation knowing.
And We saved/rescued those who believed and were fearing and obeying.
And Lot when he said to his nation: "Do you commit the enormous/atrocious deed/homosexuality ,and you are seeing/ understanding ?"
Are you that you are coming/doing/committing (E) the men (with) a lust/desire/craving from other than the women, but you are a nation being lowly/ignorant .
So his nation's answer/reply was not except that they said: "Bring/drive out Lot's family from your village/urban city, that they are people purifying ."
So We saved/rescued him and his family/people, except his woman (wife), We predestined her from the remaining behind.
And We rained on them rain, so the warned's/given notice's rain was bad/evil/harmful.
Say: "The praise/gratitude/thanks (is) to God, and peace/security on (to) His worshippers/slaves those whom He chose/purified; is God better/best or what they share/make partners (with Him)?"
Or Who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He descended for you from the sky water, so We sprouted/grew with it fenced gardens of beauty/splendor , (it) was not for you, that you sprout/grow its trees, is (there) a god with God? But they are a nation making equals (to Him).
Or Who made/created the earth/Planet Earth (as) a settlement/establishment , and made/created in between and around it rivers/waterways, and made/created for it anchors/mountains , and made/created between the two large bodies of water/seas a barrier/hindrance , is a god with God? But most of them do not know.
Or Who answers/replies (to) the compelled/forced if he called him, and He removes/uncovers (relieves) the bad/evil/harm, and He makes/puts you (as) the earth's/Planet Earth's successors and replacers/top leaders, is a god with God? Little (is) what you mention/remember .
Or Who guides you in the shore's/land's and the sea's/ocean's darknesses, and Who sends the winds/breezes (as) a good news, between His mercy's hand. Is a god with God? God (is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified from/on what they share/make partners (with Him) .
Or Who creates/initiates the creation then He repeats it , and Who provides for you from the sky/space, and the earth/Planet Earth, is a god with God? Say: "Bring your proof/evidence , if you were truthful."
Say: "Who (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth does not know the hidden/unseen except God, and they do not feel/sense/know when they are being resurrected/revived .
But their knowledge caught up (with them) in the end (other life) but they are in doubt/suspicion from it, but they are from it blinded/confused.
And those who disbelieved said: "Is (it that) if we and our fathers were dust/earth are we brought out (E)?"
We had been (E) promised this, we and our fathers from before, that this (is) except the first's/beginners/ myths/baseless stories . 
Say: "Walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth, so look/see/wonder about how was the criminals'/sinners' end (result) ."
And do not be sad/grievous on (for) them, and do not be in tightness/distress from what they cheat/deceive .
And they say: "When (is) this the promise if you were truthful?"
Say: "Maybe/perhaps that some (of) what you hurry/hasten be followed closely behind , for you."
And that your Lord (is owner) of grace/favour on the people, and but most of them do not thank/be grateful.
And that your Lord knows (E) what their chests (innermosts) conceal/hide and what they declare/publicize .
And (there) is not from a hidden/invisible in the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth except (it is) in a clear/evident Book .
That this, the Koran , narrates/informs on (to) Israel's sons and daughters most of (what) they are in it differing/disagreeing .
And that it truly is guidance and mercy to the believers.
That your Lord passes judgment/orders between them with His judgment/rule, and He is the glorious/mighty , the knowledgeable.
So rely/depend on God, that you are on the truth , the clear/evident .
That you do not make the deads hear/listen, and you do not make the deaf hear/listen (to) the call/prayer if they turned away giving their backs.
And you are not (capable) with guiding the blind/confused from their misguidance, that truly you make (to) hear/listen except who believes with Our verses/evidence/signs, so they are Moslems/submitters .
And if the saying/words fell/landed on (to) them, We brought out for them a walker/creeper from the earth/Planet Earth she/it converses/talks to them , "That the people were with Our verses/evidences not being sure/certain."
And a day/time We gather from every nation a group/crowd from who denies/falsifies with Our verses/evidences , so they are being restrained/apportioned .
Until when they came, and He said: "Did you lie/deny/falsify with My verses/evidences/signs, and you did not comprehend/encircle with it knowledge, (or) what that you were making/doing ."
And the saying/word fell/landed on (to) them with/because (of) what they caused injustice/oppression, so they do not speak.
Do they not see/understand that We created/put the night to be tranquil/settled in it, and the daytime to see (clearly lit), that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation believing.
And a day/time the horn/bugle be blown in, who is in the skies/space and who (is) in the earth/Planet Earth (is) frightened/panic stricken, except who God willed/wanted, and all came to Him degraded/humiliated/manipulated . 
And you see the mountains (that) you think/suppose it (is) hard/solid (motionless), and it passes the clouds' passage , God's making/performing , who perfected every thing, that He truly is expert/experienced with (about) what you make/do.
Who came/did with the good/goodness, so for him better than it, and they from fright/terror (on) that day, (are) safe/secure.
And who came/did with the sin/crime, so their faces/fronts were overturned/forced in the fire (and told): "Do/are you being rewarded/reimbursed except (for) what you were making/doing ?"
Truly I was ordered/commanded that I worship this the country's/land's/town's Lord, which He declared it respected/sacred, and for Him (is) every thing, and I was ordered/commanded that I be from the Moslems/submitters .
And that I read/recite/follow the Koran, so who guided, so but , he guides for his self, and who misguided, so say: "Truly I am from the warners/givers of notice."
And say: "The praise/gratitude/thanks (is) to God, He will show you/make you understand His verses/evidences , so you know it, and your Lord is not with ignoring/neglecting about/from what you make/do  
T S M .
Those are the Book's verses/evidences, the clear/evident.
We read/recite on you from Moses' information/news, and Pharaoh, with the truth to a nation believing.
That Pharaoh became high, mighty and dignified in the earth/Planet Earth, and he made its people (into) groups/parties , he weakens a group of people from them, he slaughters their sons, and he shames/keeps alive their women, that he truly was from the corrupting/disordering .
And We want/intend that We bless on those who were weakened in the earth/Planet Earth, and We make them leaders/examples, and We make them the heirs/inheritants.
And We highly position/empower for them in the earth/Planet Earth, and We show Pharaoh and Haman and their (B)'s soldiers from them what they were warning/cautioning .
And We inspired/transmitted to Moses' mother: "That breast feed him, so if you feared on (for) him, so throw him in the body of water and do not fear, and do not be sad/grieving, that We are returning him to you, and making him from the messengers."
So Pharaoh's family unintentionally found and picked him up, to be for them an enemy and sadness/grief, that truly Pharaoh and Haman and their (B)'s soldiers were erroneous/sinners .
And Pharaoh's woman (wife) said: "An eye's delight/pleasure for me and for you, do not kill him, maybe/perhaps that he benefits us, or we take/receive him (as) a child (son): "And they do not feel/know/sense .
And Moses' mother's heart became/became in the morning empty, that truly she was about to/almost to show/uncover with him, where it not for that We strengthened/braced on her heart/mind , to be from the believers.
And she said to his sister, track/follow him, so she saw/watched with him, from (a) distance and (while) they do not feel/know/sense.
And We forbade/prohibited on him the wet nurses/breast feeders from before, so she said: "Do I guide/lead you on a house's/home's people they sponsor/maintain him for you, and they are for him faithful/sincere?"
So We returned him to his mother in order that her eye delights/satisfies and she not be saddened/grieved, and to know that God's promise (is) truth , and but most of them do not know.
And when he reached his maturity/strength and straightened/leveled (matured) , We gave/brought him judgment/rule and knowledge, and like that We reward/reimburse the good doers.
And He entered the city/town at a time of negligence/disregard (unnoticed) from its people , so he found in it two men (B) fighting/killing each other, that from his group/party , and that from his enemy, so who (was) from his group/party seeked/asked him for help, on (against) who (was) from his enemy, so he struck himwith his fist so he killed on him, Moses, he said that (is) from the devils' work/deed , that he truly is an enemy, misguiding, clear/evident ."
He said: "My Lord, that I caused injustice (to) myself, so forgive for me." So He forgave for Him, that He truly is, He is the forgiving, the merciful.
He said: "My Lord, with what you blessed on me, so I will never/not be a supporter/helper to the criminals/sinners."
So he became in the city/town afraid/frightened, observing/guarding , so then who seeked victory/aid from him at the yesterday/past, he cries out/screams for his help, Moses said to him: "That you are a misguider/lurer (E) clear/evident ."
So when that he wanted/intended that he attacks violently with who he is an enemy to them (B) he said: "You Moses, do you intend/want that you kill me, as you killed a self at the yesterday/past, that you want/intend except that you be a tyrant/oppressor in the earth/Planet Earth, and you do not want that you be from the correcting/reconciliating ."
And a man came form the farthest of the city/town walking quickly/hastening he said: "You Moses, that the nobles/assembly , they conspire/plot with each other with (about) you, to kill you, so get out , that I am for you from the advisors/counselors."
So he got out from it afraid/frightened, observing/guarding , he said: "My Lord save/rescue me, from the nation, the unjust/oppressive ."
And when he aimed/turned towards Madya , he said: "Maybe/perhaps my Lord that He guides me the road's/path's straightness ."
And when he neared/approached Madya's water he found at it a nation/generation from the people, they water/irrigate and he found from other than them two women, (B) pushing/defending , he said: "What (is) your matter/concern ." They (B) said: "We do not water/irrigate until the shepherds/protectors return from the water/proceed , and our father (is) an old aged old ."
So he watered/gave drink for them (B), then he turned away to the shade/water shaded by trees , so he said: "My Lord, that I am to what you descended to me from goodness/wealth poor/deprived ."
So one of them (B) came to him, she walks on (with) shame/shyness, she said: "That my father calls you to reimburse you a wage/fee (for) what you watered/gave drink for us." So when he came to him, and he narrated/related on (to) him the narration/information (true stories) he said: "Do not fear, you were saved/rescued from the nation, the unjust/oppressive."
One of them (B) said: "You my father, hire him, that best (of) who you hired, (is) the powerful/strong, the faithful/loyal ."
He said: "That I, I want , that I marry you to one (of) my two daughters, those two, on that you hire to me (yourself for) eight pilgrimages (years), so if you completed ten, so (it) is from at you, and I do not want that I make hardship/difficulty on you, you will find me, if God willed/wanted from the correct/righteous." 
He said: "That (is) between me and between you, whichever (of) the two terms/times I accomplished/carried out, so no transgression/aggression (be) on me, and God (is) on what we say a guardian ."
So when Moses accomplished the term/time, and he walked/moved/rode with his family , he perceived/ saw from the mountain's side/direction a fire, he said to his family : "Wait/remain that I perceived/saw a fire, maybe/perhaps I come to you from it with news/information/knowledge, or a fire brand/burning ember from the fire, maybe/perhaps you warm (yourselves)."
So when he came to it, (it) was called/cried, from the valley's the right side/shore/bank, in the spot/place the blessed from the tree, that: "You Moses that I am God, Lord (of) the creations all together/(universes)."
And that (E) throw/throw away your stick/cane. So when he saw it it shakes/moves as though it (is) a Jinn , he turned away giving his back, and he did not follow/track . "You Moses approach/come, and do not fear, that you are from the safe/secure."
Enter/pass your hand in your collar/pocket , it emerges white from without evil/harm , and gather/join (fold) to you your wing/side from the terror/fright, so those two are two proofs/evidences from your Lord to Pharaoh, and his nobles/assembly , that they were a nation (of) debauchers .
He said: "My Lord, that I, I killed a self from them so I fear that they kill me."
And my brother Aaron, he is more pronouncing/eloquent (in) tongue/speech than me, so send him with me (as) support/help he confirms me , that I , I fear that they deny me .
(He said): "We will strengthen/support your upper arm/assistance (give you confidence) with your brother, and We will make/put for you (B) power/control , so they do not reach to you (B), with Our verses/evidences/signs, you (B) and who followed you (B) (are) the defeators/conquerors."
So when Moses came to them with Our evidences/signs evidences, they said: "What (is) that except magic/sorcery fabricated/cut and split, and We did not hear with that in our fathers/forefathers, the first/beginning."
And Moses said: "My Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (about) who came with the guidance from at Him, and who the house's/home's end/turn (result) be for him; that He does not make the unjust/oppressive succeed/win."
And Pharaoh said: "You, you the nobles/assembly, I did not know for you from a god other than me, so ignite/light/kindle for me you Haman on the mud/clay , so make/put for me a tall palace/tower maybe I look/see to Moses' God, and I, I think/suspect (E) him (he is) from the liars/falsifiers ."
And he became arrogant, he and his soldiers/warriors in the earth/Planet Earth without the right/truth ,and they thought/assumed that they are to Us not being returned.
So We punished/took him and his soldiers/warriors , so We discarded them/threw them away in the body of water , so look/see/wonder about how was the unjust's/oppressive's end/turn (result).
And We made them leaders/examples calling to the fire , and (on) the Resurrection Day they not be given victory/aid .
And We made them be followed in this the present world (by a) curse/torture, and (on) the Resurrection Day they are from the turned ugly/obscene . 
And We had given/brought to Moses The Book from after what We destroyed the generations the first/beginning, evidences/clear sightedness/instincts for the people and guidance and mercy, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember .
And you were not at the western's side/direction when We completed/informed to Moses the matter/affair/order/command, and you were not from the present.
And but We created/originated generations/peoples of eras , so the lifetime lengthened on (to) them, and you were not residing/dwelling in Madya's people, you read/recite on (to) them Our verses/evidences/signs, and but We, We were sending .
And you were not at the mountain's side/direction, when We called, and but mercy from your Lord, to warn/give notice (to) a nation, a warner/giver of notice did not come to them from before you, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember .
Had it not been for that a disaster strikes them because (of) what their hands presented/undertook , so they said: "Our Lord, if only you sent on (to) us a messenger, so we follow your verses/evidences/signs, and we be from the believers."
So when the truth came to them from at Us, they said: "If only (he) was given/brought to equal/similar (to) what was given/brought (to) Moses." Did they not disbelieve with what was given/brought (to) Moses from before? They said: "Two magicians/sorcerers, they (B) cooperated (with)/backed each other." And they said: "That we are with all/each disbelieving."
Say: "So come with a Book from at God, He/it is more guided/guiding than them (B), I follow it if you were truthful."
So if they did not answer/reply to you, so know that they follow their self attractions for desires , and who (is) more misguided than who followed his self attractions for desires without guidance from God? That (E) God does not guide the nation, the unjust/oppressive.
And We had reached/connected for them the words/opinion and belief maybe/perhaps they remember/mention
Those who We gave/brought them The Book from before it/Him, they are with it/Him believing.
And if (it) is read/recited on (to) them, they said: "We believed with it, that it truly is the truth from our Lord, that we were from before it Moslems/submitters ."
Those, they, they are given their reward twice because (of) what they were patient, and they drive away/repel the sins/crimes with the good/goodness, and from what We provided for them they spend.
And if they heard/listened (to) the nonsense/senseless talk , they turned away from it, and they said: "For us (are) our deeds, and for you, your deeds, a greeting/peace on (to) you, we do not wish/desire the lowly/ignorant ."
That you do not guide whom you loved/liked, and but God guides whom He wills/wants, and He is more knowledgeable with (about) the guided. 
And they said: "If (E) we follow the guidance with you we be snatched from our land ." Did We not strengthen/secure for them forbidden/sacred safe/secure fruits (of) every thing is being gathered to it, provision from at Us, and but most of them do not know.
And how many We perished/destroyed from a village/urban city its life/livelihood/sustenance became unappreciated/undeserved (they were ungrateful for their livelihood), so those are their residences, did not get inhabited from after them, except a few/little , and We were, We, the heirs/inheritants.
And your Lord was not perishing/destroying the villages/urban cities, until He sends in its origin a messenger, he reads/recites on (to) them Our verses/evidences/signs, and We were not destroying the villages/urban cities, except and (while) its people (are) unjust/oppressive .
And you were not given from a thing so enjoyment (of) the life the present/worldly life, and its decoration/beauty/ornament, and what (is) at God (is) best and more lasting/continuing (everlasting), so do you not reason/comprehend ?
Is who We promised him a good/beautiful promise, so he is receiving/finding it (E) , as who We made him enjoy the life the present's/worldly life's enjoyment then he is (on) the Resurrection Day from present/attending?
And a day/time He calls them, so He says: "Where (are) My partners those whom you were claiming/alleging ?"
Those who the saying/opinion and belief became deserved on (to) them said: "Our Lord, those (are) those who we misguided , we misguided them as/like we were misguided we declared innocence to You, they were not (to) us worshipping."
And (it) was said: "Call your partners." so they called them, so they did not answer/reply to them, and they saw/understood the torture. If only that they were being guided.
And a day/time He calls them, so He says: "What (did) you reply/answer the messengers?"
So the information/news was blinding/confusing on (to) them (on) that day, so they do not ask/question each other.
So but who repented, and believed, and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so maybe/perhaps that (he) be from the successful/winners.
And your Lord creates what He wills/wants, and He chooses; the best choice/best is/was not for them, God's praise/glory and high, mighty, exalted and dignified from/about what they share/make partners (with Him).
And your Lord knows what their chests (innermosts) conceal/cover , and what they declare/publicize .
And He is God, (there is) no God except Him, for Him (is) the praise/gratitude in the first/beginning and the end (other life), and for Him (is) the judgment/rule, and to Him, you are being returned.
Say: "Did you see/understand if God made/put on you the night continuous to the Resurrection Day? Which god other than God, brings you with a light/illumination , so do you not hear/listen?" 
Say: "Did you see/understand if God made/put on you the daytime continuous to the Resurrection Day? Which god other than God, brings you with night to be tranquil/settling in it, so do you not see/look/understand?
And from His mercy, He made/put for you the night and the daytime, to be tranquil/settled in it, and to wish/desire from His grace/favour/blessing, and maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
And a day/time He calls them, so he says: "Where (are) my partners (with Me) those whom you were claiming/alleging ?"
And We removed/pulled away from every nation/generation/century, a witness/testifier , so We said: "Bring/give your proof/evidence." So they knew that the truth (is) to God, and what they were making/fabricating , (was) wasted/lost from them.
That (E) Qaroon/Korah was from Moses' nation, so he oppressed/transgressed on them, and We gave/brought him from the treasures what that (E) its keys (is a) burdensome weight (E) with (for) the group/band/company of strength/power , when his nation said to him: "Do not rejoice/delight , that (E) God does not love/like the rejoiced/delighted ."
And wish/desire in what God gave you, the home/house (of) the end (other life), and do not forget your share/fortune in the present world, and do good deeds (give charity) as/like God did good to you, and do not wish/desire the corruption in the land/Planet Earth, that (E) God does not love/like the corrupting/disordering .
He said: "But/truly I got it on knowledge at me." Did he not know that God had perished/destroyed from before him from the generations/peoples of eras who he is stronger than him power/strength and more gathering/assembling? And the criminals/sinners do not be asked/questioned about their crimes.
So he got out/emerged on (to) his nation in his decoration/beauty/ornament, those who want the life the present/worldly life said: "Oh, if only for us similar/equal (to) what Qaroon/Korah was given/brought to, that he truly is of great luck/fortune."
And those who were given the knowledge said: "Your calamity , God's reward/compensation (is) best to who believed, and made/did correct/righteous deeds, and none receives/meets/finds it except the patient."
So We sunk down the Earth/land with him and with his home/house. So (there) was not for him from a group (to) give him victory/aid from other than God, and (he) was not from the victorious.
And those who wished/desired his place/position at the yesterday/past became/became in the morning saying: "Woe as if/as though God spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves , and He is capable/able , if only that God blessed on us He would have sunk down (the land) with us, woe, as if he/as though He does not make the disbelievers succeed/win ."
That is the house/home of the end (other life), We make/create it to those who do not want height, might and dignity in the earth/Planet Earth, and nor a corruption , and the end (result) is to the fearing and obeying. 
Who came with the good/goodness, so to him better than it, and who came with the sin/crime, so those who made/did the sins/crimes will not be reimbursed except (for) what they were making/doing .
That (E) who specified/imposed/stipulated on you the Koran, (is) returning you (E) to a return/paradise/final place , say: "My Lord (is) more knowledgeable (of) who came with the guidance, and who he is in (a) clear/evident misguidance."
And you were not hoping/expecting that (E) The Book be thrown to you, except mercy from your Lord, so do not be (E) supporting/helping to the disbelievers.
And let (them) not obstruct/prevent you from God's verses/evidences after when (it) was descended to you, and call to your Lord, and do not be from the sharers/takers of partners (with God) .
And do not call with God another god, (there is) no god except Him, every thing (is) perishing/destroying ,except His face/front , for Him (is) the judgment/rule, and to Him you are being returned. 
A L M .
Did the people think/suppose that they be left that they say: "We believed." And they are not being tested .
And We had tested those who (were) from before them, so God knows (E) those who were truthful, and He knows (E) the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
Or those who make/do the sins/crimes thought/supposed that they precede/surpass Us , it became bad/evil/harmful what they judge/rule.
Who was/is hoping/expecting God's meeting, so that God's term/time is coming (E), and He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
And who struggled/exerted , so but he struggles/exerts for his self, that God (is) rich (E) from (not in need to) the creations all together/(universes)
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds We will cover/substitute from their sins/crimes (E), and We will reimburse them (E) best (of) what they were making/doing .
And We directed/recommended the human (with) a goodness/beauty with (to) his parents, and if they (B) did their utmost against you to share/make partners with Me, for what is not for you knowledge with it, so do not obey them (B), to Me (is) your return, so I inform you with what you were making/doing.
And those who believed, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, We will enter them (E) in (with) the correct/righteous.
And from the people who says: "We believed by God." So if he was harmed mildly in God, he made/put the people's test/torture as/like God's torture, and if victory/aid came from your Lord, they will say (E): "That we were with you." Or is not God with more knowledgeable with what (is in) the creation's all together's/(universes) chests (innermosts).
And God knows (E) those who believed, and He knows (E) the hypocrites.
And those who disbelieved said to those who believed: "Follow our way/method , and we bear/carry (E) your sins/mistakes ." And they are not with carrying from their sins/mistakes from a thing, that they truly are lying/denying/falsifying (E).
And they will carry/endure (E) their loads/weights (burdens) and loads/weights (burdens) with their loads/weights (burdens), and they will be asked/questioned (E) (on) the Resurrection Day about what they were fabricating/cutting and splitting.
And We had sent Noah to his nation, so he stayed/waited/remained in (between) them one thousand year(s) except fifty year(s), so the deadly/great flood punished them , and (while) they are unjust/oppressive.
So We saved/rescued him and the ship's/boat's owners/company/friends, and We made it a sign/evidence to the creations all together/(universes).
And Abraham when he said to his nation: "Worship God, and fear and obey Him, that (is) best for you, if you were knowing."
But/truly you worship from other than God (except) idolized statues/idols, and you create lies/falsehood, that those who you worship from other than God do not own/possess for you a provision , so wish/desire at God the provision , and worship Him, and thank/be grateful to Him, to Him you are being returned.
And if you lie/deny/falsify, so nations from before you had lied/denied/falsified, and nothing (is) on the messenger except the information/communication, the clear/evident .
Did they not see/understand how God begins/initiates the creation then He returns/repeats it? That (E) that (is) on God easy/little .
Say: "Walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth, so see/wonder about how He began/initiated the creation, then God creates/originates the creation/origination the end/last, that (E) God (is) on every thing capable/able.
He tortures whom He wills/wants, and He has mercy (upon) whom He wills/wants, and to Him you are being turned/returned .
And you are not with disabling/frustrating in the earth/Planet Earth, and nor in the sky/space, and (there is) none for you from other than God from (a) guardian/ally , and nor a victorior/savior .
And those who disbelieved with God's verses/evidences/signs, and meeting Him, those, they despaired/became hopeless from My mercy, and those for them (is) a painful torture.
So his nation's answer/reply was not except that they said: "Kill him, or burn him." so God saved/rescued him from the fire, that in that (are) evidences/signs/verses (E), to a nation believing.
And he said: "But/truly you took/received from other than God idols/idolized statues, love/affection/friendship between you in the life the present/worldly life, then (on) the Resurrection Day some of you disbelieves with some, and some of you curses/humiliates some, and your shelter/refuge (is) the fire, and (there are) none from victoriors/saviors for you."
So Lot believed to him, so he said: "That I am emigrating to my Lord, that He truly is the glorious/mighty ,the wise/judicious ."
And We granted to him (Abraham) Isaac and Jacob, and We made/put in their descendants the prophethood and The Book , and We gave/brought him his reward/wage/fee in the present world, and that he truly is in the end (other life) from (E) the correct/righteous.
And Lot when he said to his nation: "That you do/commit (E) the enormous/atrocious deed not one from the creations all together/(universes) preceded you with it ."
That you are coming/doing/committing (E) (to) the men (sexually), and you cut off/sever the way/path , and you come/commit in your gathering/assembly/club (with) the defiance of God and His orders/obscenity . So his nation's answer/reply was not except that they said: "Come/bring to us with God's torture, if you were from the truthful."
He said: "My Lord give me victory/aid over the nation the corrupting ." 
And when Our messengers, came (to) Abraham with the good news, they said: "We are (E), we are perishing/destroying , this the village's/urban cities' people , that (E) its people were unjust/oppressive."
He said: "That (E) in it (is) Lot." They said: "We are more knowledgeable with who (is) in it, we will save/rescue him (E) and his family/people except his woman (wife) was from the remaining behind."
And when that Our messengers came (to) Lot he felt bad/evil/harm with them, and he was impatient with them/unable to do or accomplish what ought to be done (became troubled), and they said: "Do not fear, and nor be sad/grievous, that we are saving/rescuing you and your family/people except your woman (wife) was from the remaining behind."
We (E), we are descending on, this the village's/urban cities' people , filth/torture from the sky/space because (of) what they were debauching .
And We had left from it an evident sign/evidence to a nation reasoning/understanding .
And to Madya their brother Shu'aib , so he said: "My nation worship God, and hope/expect the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth corrupting ."
So they denied him so the tremble and shake/quake/agitation punished/took them, so they became/became in the morning in their home/country/tribe stuck to the ground dead .
And Aad , and Thamud , and had been clarified/shown/explained to you from their residences, and the devil decorated/beautified for them their deeds , so he prevented/obstructed them from the road/path and they were seeing/knowing/understanding.
And Qaroon/Korah , and Pharaoh and Haman , and had come to them Moses with the evidences, so they became arrogant in the earth/Planet Earth, and they were not racing/surpassing/preceding.
So each/all We took/punished with his crime so from them, whom We sent on (to) him a violent wind carrying pebbles and hail/hail laden clouds, and from them whom the loud strong cry/torture raid punished/took him, and from them whom We sunk down/caved in with him the earth/Planet Earth, and from them whom We drowned/sunk, and God was not to cause injustice/oppress them, and but they were themselves causing injustice/oppression.
(The) example proverb (of) those who took from other than God guardians/allies , (is) as the example/proverb (of) the spider, it took/received (F) a house/home, and that (the) weakest/most feeble (of) the houses/homes, (is the) house/home (E) (of) the spider, if they were knowing.
That God knows what they call from other than Him from a thing, and He is the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
And those are the examples/proverbs, We give it to the people and none understands/comprehends it except the knowing .
God created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth , that in that (is) a sign/evidence (E) to the believers. 
Read/recite/follow what was inspired/transmitted to you from The Book , and start/keep up the prayers, that (E) the prayers forbid/prevent from the enormous/atrocious deeds and the defiance of God and His orders/obscenity , and God's remembrance/reminder (E) (is) greater , and God knows what you perform/produce .
And do not argue/dispute with The Book's people except with which it is best , except those who were unjust/oppressive from them, and say: "We believed with what was descended on (to) us, and was descended to you, and our God, and your God (is) one, and we are to Him Moslems/submitters ."
And like that, We descended to you The Book , so those who We gave/brought them The Book , they believe by (in) it, and from those who believes by (in) it, and none disbelieves and denies with Our verses/evidences except the disbelievers.
And We were not reading/reciting from before it from a Book , and nor you write it with your right (hand), then the wasters/falsifiers would have doubted/become suspicious.
But it is verses/evidences evidences in those who were given/brought the knowledge's chests (innermosts), and none disbelieves and denies with Our verses/evidences except the unjust/oppressive.
And they said: "If only verses/evidences/signs were descended on (to) him from his Lord." Say: "But/truly the verses/evidence/signs (are) at God, and but/truly I am a clear/evident warner/giver of notice ."
Was (it) not enough/sufficient for them that We descended on (to) you The Book (it) is being read/recited on (to) them, that in that (is) mercy (E) and a remembrance/reminder to a nation believing.
Say: "Enough/sufficient by God between me and between you (as) a witness/testifier , He knows what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and those who believed by (in) the falsehood, and disbelieved by (in) God, those, they are the losers."
And they hasten/urge you with the torture, and where it not for a named/identified (specified) term/time, the torture would have come to them, and it will come to them (E) suddenly/unexpectedly, and (while) they do not feel/sense/know.
They hasten/urge you with the torture, and that truly Hell is surrounding/enveloping (E) with the disbelievers.
A day/time the torture covers/afflicts them from above them, and from below/beneath their feet, and He/it says: "Taste/experience what you were making/doing ."
You, My worshippers/slaves those who believed, that truly My ground/land/Earth (is) spread/spacious , so (only) Me, so worship Me.
Each/every self (is) tasting/experiencing the death, then to Us you are being returned.
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, We (will) reside/assign them (E) from the Paradise/treed garden chambers/elevated (stages/places), the rivers/waterways run/flow from below/beneath it, immorally/eternally in it, blessed/praised (is) the makers'/doers' reward/fee .
Those who were patient, and on their Lord they rely/trust in . 
And how many from a walker/creeper/crawler (that) does not bear/carry its provision? God provides for it and you. And He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
And if (E) you asked/questioned them: "Who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and subjugated for you the sun and the moon?" They will say (E): "God ." So where/how (would) they be turned away ?
God spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves , and He is capable/over powering to/for it, that truly God (is) with every thing knowledgeable.
And if (E) you asked/questioned them: "Who descended from the sky water, so He revived with it the Earth/land from after its death/lifelessness?" They will say (E): "God." Say: "The praise/gratitude (is) to God, but/indeed most of them, they do not reason/understand ."
And this the life the present/worldly life is not except a play thing/amusement/diversion and playing/enjoyment , and that the end's (other life's) home/house (E) it is (E) the life if they were knowing.
So if they rode/embarked in the ship/ships, they called God faithful/loyal/devoted to him (in) the religion, so when He saved/rescued them to the shore/land, then they share/make partners (with Him).
To disbelieve with what We gave/brought them, and to live long/enjoy, so they will/shall know.
Do they not see/understand that We made/put (a) respected/sacred safe/secure, and the people (are) being snatched from around/surrounding them, is it with the falsehood they believe and with God's blessing/goodness they disbelieve?
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated/cut and split on (about) God lies/falsehood or lied/denied/falsified with the truth when (it) came to him, is not in Hell a home/dwelling to the disbelievers?
And those who struggled/exerted in Us (for Our sake), We guide them (E) Our ways/paths/methods ,and that truly God (is) with the good doers. 
A L M .
The Romans were defeated/conquered .
In the land's/planet Earth's nearest , and they, from after their defeat they will conquer .
In (a) few years (between  - ), to God (is) the matter/order from before and from after, and (on) that day the believers rejoice/delight .
With God's victory/aid, He gives victory/aid (to) whom He wills/wants, and He (is) the glorious/mighty, the merciful.
God's promise, God does not break His promise and but most of the people do not know.
They know (what is) apparent/visible from the life the present/worldly life, and they are from the end (other life), they are ignoring/disregarding .
Did they not think in themselves God did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and what (is) between them (B) except with the truth and a named/identified (specified) term/time, and that many from the people with their Lord's meeting (they are) disbelieving.
Do they not walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth, so they look/wonder about how was those from before them's end/turn (result)? They were stronger than them (in) strength/power, and they erupted and spread/plowed the earth/Planet Earth and they inhabited/built it more than what they inhabited/built it , and their messengers came to them with the evidences, so God was not to cause injustice to/oppress them, and but they were themselves causing injustice/oppression.
Then (the) end/turn (result of) those who did bad/evil/harm (is) the bad/evil/harm/fire, that (is because) they denied/falsified with God's signs/verses/evidences, and they were with it mocking/making fun.
God begins/initiates the creation then He returns/repeats it, then to Him you are being returned.
And a day/time the Hour/Resurrection starts the criminals/sinners become confused/dumbfounded.
And (there) were not for them from their partners (with God) mediators, and they were with their partners (with God) disbelievers.
And a day/time the Hour/Resurrection starts , (on) that day they separate.
So but those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so they are in a garden/meadow ,being rejoiceful/delighted.
And but those who disbelieved and lied/denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences , and the end's (other life's) meeting, so those are in the torture, they are made to be present/made to attend.
So God's praise/glory when you enter into the evening and when you become (awaken) in the morning .
And to Him (is) the praise/gratitude in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and (at) evening/first darkness when you cooperate/support/help .
He brings out/emerges the live/alive from the dead, and He brings out/emerges the dead from the live/alive, and He revives the Earth/land after its death/lifelessness, and like that/that is how you are brought out.
And from His verses/evidences/signs, that (E) He created you from dust/earth, then you were humans spreading out/extending .
And from His evidences/signs that (E) He created for you from yourselves spouses to be tranquil/secure to it, and He made/created between you love/affection/friendship and mercy, that (E) in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation thinking.
And from His evidences/signs (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's creation, and your tongue's/speech's , and your colour's difference, that (E) in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to the creations all together/(universes).
And from His evidences/signs (is) your sleep/dream at the night, and the daytime, and your wishing/desiring from His grace/favour/blessing, that (E) in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation hearing/listening.
And from His evidences/signs , He shows you/makes you understand the lightning, fearfully and coveting/desirous , and He descends from the sky water so He revives with it the Earth/land after its death/lifelessness, that (E) in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation reasoning/comprehending .
And from His evidences/signs (is) that (E) the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth stand/keep up with His matter/order , then if He called you a call/request from the earth/Planet Earth, then you are, you are emerging/appearing .
And to Him what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, each/all (are) to Him obeying/worshipping humbly .
And He is who begins/initiates the creation, then He returns/repeats it, and it is easier/lighter on Him, and for Him (is) the example/proverb the highest/mightiest/most dignified in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
He gave for you an example/proverb from your selves, are (there) for you from what your right (hands) owned/possessed from partners in what We provided for you (are your servants etc. equal partners in your wealth)? So you are (all) in it equal/alike? You fear them as you are fearing yourselves, (if you do not accept this for yourselves how could you make equal partners to God)? Like that We detail/explain the verses/evidences/signs to a nation reasoning/comprehending .
But/rather those who caused injustice/oppression followed their self attractions for desires without knowledge, so who guides whom God misguided? And (there are) none from victoriors/saviors for them.
So keep up your face/front to the religion, (as) a submitter/Moslem/Unifier of God , God's nature/manner/religion which He created/originated the people on it, (there is) no replacement/substitution to God's creation, that (is) the religion the straight/valuable , and but most of the people do not know.
Returning to God/repenting/obeying to Him, and fear and obey Him, and keep up/start the prayers, and do not be from the sharers/takers of partners (with God).
From those who separated (in) their religion, and they were groups/parties (sects) , each/every group/party (sect) with what (is) at them they are happy/rejoiced .
And if harm touched the people, they called their Lord returning repenting/obeying to Him, then if He made them taste/experience from Him mercy, then a group/party/flock from them (are) with their Lord sharing/making partners.
To disbelieve with what We gave/brought them, so live long/enjoy, so you will/shall know.
Or We descended on them a proof/evidence , so he/it converses/speaks with what they were with Him sharing/making partners.
And if We made the people taste/experience mercy, they became happy/delighted with it, and if a sin/crime (harm) hits/strikes them because (of) what their hands advanced/introduced , then they, they despair.
Do they not see/understand that God spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants, and He is capable/able ? That in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation believing.
So give/bring the relatives/relations/near his right/share , and the poorest of poor/poor oppressed, and the traveler/stranded traveler, that (is) best to those who want God's face/front/direction, and those are the successful/winners.
And what you gave/brought from a growth/increase/any interest (mortgages etc.) to grow/increase in the people's properties/wealths , so (it) does not grow/increase at God, and what you gave/brought from charity/purification , you want/intend God's face/front/direction, so those, they are the doublers/multipliers.
God (is) who created you, then He provided for you, then He makes you die, then He revives/makes you alive, are (there) from your partners (with God) who makes/does from that from a thing? His praise/glory and (He is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified about what they share/make partners (with Him).
The corruption/disorder appeared/became visible in the shore/land and sea/ocean because (of) what the people's hands earned/gained/acquired to make them taste/experience some/part of what they made/did , maybe/perhaps they return.
Say: "Walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth, so see/wonder about how was those from before's end/turn (result), most of them were sharers/takers of partners (with God)."
So keep up your face/front/direction to the religion, the straight/valuable , from before that a day/time comes, (there is) no return to it from God, (on) that day they declare openly/separate .
Who disbelieved, so on him (is) his disbelief, and who made/did correct/righteous deeds, so to them selves they are preparing/paving. 
To reward/reimburse those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds from His grace/blessing , that He truly does not love/like the disbelievers.
And from His evidences/signs that He sends the winds/breezes announcers of good news, and to make you taste/experience from His mercy, and the ship/ships to flow/pass with His order/command, and ask/wish/desire from His grace/favour/blessing, and maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
And We had sent from before you messengers to their nation, so they came to them with the evidences, so We revenged/punished from those who committed crimes/sins, and (it) was truly/deservedly on Us the believers' victory/aid.
God is who sends the winds/breezes so it spreads/agitates clouds, so He spreads/extends it in the sky how He wills/wants, and He makes it pieces, so you see the rain appears/emerges from in between and around it, so when He struck with it whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves , then they are announcing good news/cheerful .
And that truly they were from before that (E) it be made to descend on them, from before it, confused/dumbfounded (E).
So look/wonder about to God's mercy's tracks/marks/signs, how He revives/makes alive the Earth/land after its death/lifelessness, that truly that (is) reviving the deads, and He is on every thing capable/able.
And if (E) We sent a wind/breeze so they saw it yellow/yellowish, they would have continued/remained from after it disbelieving.
So that you do not make the deads hear/listen, and nor make the deaf hear/listen the call/prayer , if they turned away giving (their) backs.
And you are not with guiding the blind/misguided from their misguidance, you make none hear/listen except who believes with (in) Our verses/evidences , so they are Moslems/submitters .
God (is) who created you from weakness then He created/put from after weakness power/strength, then He created/put from after power/strength weakness, and white or gray (old aged), He creates what He wills/wants, and He is the knowledgeable, the capable/able .
And a day/time the Hour/Resurrection starts the criminals/sinners swear/make oath (that) they did stay/remain except an hour, as/like that, they were being lied to/turned away.
And those who were given/brought the knowledge and the faith/belief said: "You had stayed/remained in God's term/fate/destiny Book to the Revival Day/Resurrection Day, so this (is) the Revival Day/Resurrection Day, and but you were not knowing.
So (on) that day those who caused injustice/oppression, their apologies/excuses do not benefit (them), and nor they, they be allowed to offer reconciliation/appeasement .
And We had (E) given to the people in this the Koran from every example/proverb, and if (E) you came to them with a verse/evidence/sign those who disbelieved will say (E) : "That truly you are except wasters/annulers ."
As/like that God stamps/seals on those who do not knows' hearts/minds. 
So be patient, that truly God's promise (is) truth , and (let) not those who (are) not being sure/certain mislead/fool you  
A L M .
Those are The Book the wise's/judicious' verses/evidences .
Guidance and mercy to the good doers.
Those who keep up/start the prayers and give/bring the charity/purification , and they are with the end (other life) they are sure/certain.
Those are on guidance from their Lord, and those are the successful/winners.
And from the people who buys the information's/speeches' amusement/fun to misguide from God's way/path without knowledge, and He takes it mockingly/making fun, those, for them (is) a humiliating/degrading torture.
And if Our verses/evidences are read/recited on (to) him, he turned away arrogantly, as if he did not hear/listen (to) it, as if in his two ears (is) deafness/a heavy weight , so announce good news to him with a painful torture.
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them (is) the blessing's/goodness' treed gardens/paradises.
Immorally/eternally in it, God's promise truly/deservedly , and He (is) the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
He created the skies/space without pillars/supports (that) you see it , and He threw in the earth/Planet Earth anchors/mountains that (E) it sways and leans with you, and He scattered/distributed in it from every/each walker/creeper/crawler , and We descended from the sky/space water, so We sprouted/grew in it from every generous pair .
That (is) God's creation, so show Me/make Me understand what those from other than Him created, but the unjust/oppressive (are) in clear/evident misguidance.
And We had given/brought Lukman the wisdom that (E) thank/be grateful to God, and who thanks/is grateful, so but he thanks/is grateful to/for his self, and who disbelieved, so then God (is) rich, praiseworthy/commendable.
And when Lukman said to his son, and (while) he preaches/advises him: "You my son do not share/make partners with God, that truly the sharing/partnership (with God is) great injustice/oppression (E)."
And We recommended/commanded the human with his parents, his mother carried/conceived/was pregnant (with) him weakness/feebleness on weakness/feebleness, and his weaning/separation in two years, that thank/be grateful to Me and to your parents, to Me (is) the end/destination.
And if they (B) made you exert on that you share/make partners with Me what knowledge is not to you with it, so do not obey them (B), and accompany/befriend them (B) in the present world (with) kindness , andfollow (the) road/path (of) who returned/repented to Me, then to Me (is) your return, so I inform you with what you were making/doing.
(Lukman said): "You my son, that it truly is, if (it) be a weight (of) a seed/grain from mustard , so (it) was/be in a rock or in the skies/space or in the earth/Planet Earth, God comes with it, that truly God is kind/courteous , expert/experienced ."

A L M .
The Book's descent, no doubt/suspicion in it, (is) from the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
Or they say: "He fabricated/cut and split it." But it is the truth from your Lord to warn/give notice (to) a nation, none from a warner/giver of notice did come to them from before you, maybe/perhaps they be guided.
God is who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and what (is) between them (B) in six days/times, then He aimed to/sat on on the throne , none from a mediator and nor guardian/ally (is) for you from other than Him, so do you not mention/remember ?
He plans/regulates the matter/affair from the sky/space to the earth/Planet Earth, then (it) ascends/zigzags to Him in a day/time its measure/estimation (is) one thousand years from what you count.
That (is) knower (of) the unseen/invisible and the testimony/presence , the glorious/mighty ,the merciful.
Who bettered every thing He created it, and He started/began the human's/mankind's creation from mud/clay .
Then He created/made his off spring/descendants from descendent/strain/gene/progeny from humiliated/degraded water.
Then He straightened Him, and He blew in Him from His Soul/Spirit , and He made/put for you the hearing/listening, and the eye sights/knowledge, and the hearts , little (is) what you thank/be grateful.

Say: "The death's/lifelessness' angel who was appointed a keeper to you, makes you die, then to your Lord you are being returned."
And if you see/understand when the criminals/sinners (are) putting down their heads/tops at their Lord: "Our Lord, we saw/understood , and we heard/listened, so return us, we make/do correct/righteous deeds, that we are sure/certain."
And if We wanted/willed We would have given/brought every/each self its guidance, and but the expression/word/opinion and belief from Me became truth , I will fill (E) Hell from the Jinns and the people, all/altogether .
So taste/experience with what you forgot, this your day's/time's meetings that We, We forgot you, and taste/experience the immortality's/eternity's torture because (of) what you were making/doing.
Truly/indeed (who) believes with Our verses/evidences (are) those who if they were reminded with it they fell down prostrating and they praised/glorified with their Lord's praise/gratitude , and they do not be arrogant.
Their sides distances/becomes restless from the places of laying down (beds), they call their Lord fearfully and desiring/coveting , and from what We provided for them they spend.
So no self knows what I hide for them from an eyes'/sights' delight/satisfaction , a reward/reimbursement because (of) what they were making/doing .
Is who was believing as who was debauching ? They do not become equal/alike.
As to those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so for them (are) treed gardens/paradises (as) the shelter/refuge, a place of descent/prepared guest house because (of) what they were making/doing .
As to those who debauched , so their shelter/refuge (is) the fire , whenever they wanted that they get out/emerge from it, they were returned in it, and (it) was said to them: "Taste experience the fire's torture which you were with it denying ."
And We will make them taste/experience (E) from the torture the nearest , other than the torture the greatest , maybe/perhaps they return.
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who was reminded with His Lord's verses/signs/evidences, then he turned away/opposed from it? That We are from the criminals/sinners, We are revenging/punishing (We are revenging/punishing the criminals/sinners).

Did it not guide for them how many We perished/destroyed from before them from the peoples of eras/centuries , they walk in their residences, that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) so do they not hear/listen?
Do they not see/understand that We, We drive the water to the land/Earth the barren/infertile , so We bring out/emerge with it plants/crops, their camels/livestock and them selves eat from it, so do they not see/understand ?
And they say: "When (is) this, the opening/victory if you were truthful?"
Say: "(A) day/time (of) the opening/victory those who disbelieved, their belief does not benefit (them), and nor they be given time/thought about ."

Say: "Who that protects/shelters you from God if He willed/wanted bad/evil/harm with you? Or He willed/wanted mercy with you? And they do not find for them from other than God a guardian/ally , and nor a victorior/savior ."
God had known the hinderers, obstructers, disincentivators and delayers from you and the saying/speakers to their brothers: "Come to us." And they do not come/do (join) the war/hardship , except a little/few.
Miser/stingy/careful on (to) you, so if the fear/fright came, you saw them looking to you, their eyes/sights turn/roll as who makes/becomes unconscious on him from the death/lifelessness (as who faints from fear of death), so if the fear/fright went away they harmed/stabbed you with sharp/hard tongues/speeches , miser/stingy/careful on the good , those they did not believe, so God wasted/invalidated their deeds, and that was on God easy/little .

And they caused injustice/oppression (to) themselves, so We made them (as) information , and We tore/scattered them every/each tearing/scattering , that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to every/each patient/endurer, thankful/grateful.
And Satan , his assumption/thought had been truthful on them, so they followed him except a group/party from the believers.
And nothing from a power/authority/control was for him on them, except to know who believes with (in) the end (other life) than who he is from it in doubt/suspicion, and your Lord (is) on every thing (an) honest protector/observor .
Say: "Call those whom you claimed/purported from other than God, they do not own/possess a smallest particle of any thing's in the universe's weight in the skies/space, and nor in the earth/Planet Earth, and (there is) nothing for them in them (B) from a share/partnership, and nothing for Him from them from a supporter/helper (God has no help from their gods and nor does he need their support or help).
And the mediation does not benefit/become useful at him except to whom He permitted/allowed to him, until when terror/panic (was) removed from their hearts/minds , they said: "What (did) your Lord say?" They said: "The truth, and He is the high and mighty/dignified, the great ." 
Say: "Who provides for you from the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth?" Say: "God and that we or you (are) on (E) guidance, or in clear/evident misguidance."
Say: "You will not be questioned/asked about what we committed a crime/sin, and nor we be asked/questioned about what you make/do ."
Say: "Our Lord gathers/collects between us, then He opens/judges between us with the truth , and He is the opener/judge , the knowledgeable."
Say: "Show me/make me understand those whom you joined with Him partners (with God), no but He is God, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious .
And We did not send you except to the people all (as) an announcer and a warner/giver of notice , and but most of the people do not know.
And they say: "When (is) that the promise if you where truthful?"
Say: "For you (is) a day's/time's appointment you do not delay/lag behind an hour , and nor you advance/precede ."
And those who disbelieved said: "We will never/not believe with this the Koran, and nor with what (is) between its hands." And if you see/understand if the unjust/oppressive (were) made to stand/suspended at their Lord, some of them return to some the saying/words/opinion and belief, those who were weakened say to those who became arrogant: "Where it not for you, we would be believers/believing."
Those who were arrogant said to those who were weakened: "Did we prevent/obstruct you from the guidance after when (it) came to you? But you were criminals/sinners."
And those who were weakened said to those who were arrogant: "But the night's and daytime's cheatery/deceit when you order/command us that (E) we disbelieve with (in) God, and we make/put/create for Him equals (idols)." And they kept the regret/remorse secret, when they saw the torture, and We made/put the leather or iron collars or hand cuffs in those who disbelieved's necks, are they reimbursed except (for) what they were making/doing ?
And We did not send in a village/urban city from a warner/giver of notice except (that) its luxuriated ungrateful and arrogant said: "That we with what you were sent with it (are) disbelieving."
And they said: "We (have) more properties/possessions/wealths and children, and we are not with being tortured."
Say: "That truly my Lord spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants, and He is capable/able and but most of the people do not know."
And your properties/possessions/wealths, and nor your children (are) not with which near/approach you at Us, approachment/advancement except who believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so those for them (is) the double reward/reimbursement because (of) what they made/did , and they are in the chambers/elevated (stages/places) (are) safe/secure.
And those who strive/endeavor in Our verses/evidences disabling/frustrating, those are in the torture, they are made to be present/attend. 
Say: "That truly my Lord extends/spreads the provision to whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves , and He is capable/able to it, and what you spent from a thing, so He reverses/replaces it , and He is best (of) the providers."
And a day/time He gathers them all/all together then He says to the angels: "Are those (who) were (to) you worshipping?"
They said: "Your praise/glory; you are our guardian/ally from other than them, but they were worshipping the Jinns , most of them with them (are) believing."
So the day/today some of you do not own/possess to some benefit/usefulness and nor harm, and We say to those who were unjust/oppressive: "Taste/experience the fire's torture which you were with it lying/denying/falsifying."
And if Our evidences/verses are read/recited on (to) them evidences, they said: "That (is) not except a man, he wants/intends that he obstructs you from what your fathers were worshipping." And they said: "That (is) not except fabricated/cut and split lies/falsehood." And those who disbelieved said to (about) the truth when (it) came to them: "That truly this (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery."
And what We give/bring them from books they study/memorize/read it, and what We sent them before you from a warner/giver of notice .
And those from before them lied/denied , and they did not reach one tenth what We gave/brought them, so they denied My messengers, so how was My severity/change (anger) ?
Say: "Indeed/but I preach to/warn you with one (thing), that (E) you stand to God two twos/twos or singularly/one by one, then you think insanity/madness (is) not with your companion/friend (your messenger is not mad), that truly he is except a warner/giver of notice for you, between a severe torture's hands."
Say: I did not ask/question you from a reward , so it is for you, that truly my reward (is) except on God, and He is on every thing (an) honest witness/testifier ."
Say: "That truly my Lord throws/hurls with the truth, knower (of) the unseens/supernaturals ."
Say: "The truth came, and the falsehood does not start/initiate , and nor return/repeat."
Say: "That if I became misguided so but I misguide on (to) my self, and if I was guided, so (it is) with what my Lord inspires/transmits to me, that He truly is hearing/listening, near/close."
And if you see/understand when/if they were frightened/panic stricken , so (there is) no passing/missing (escape) , and they were taken/punished from a near/close place/position.
And they said: "We believed with (in) it." And from where/how to them (is) the skirmish/clash ? From a far/distant place/position.
And they had disbelieved with (in) Him from before, and they throw/hurl with the unseen/hidden from a far/distant place/position.
And intervened between them and between what they lust/desire as was made/done with their groups/supporters from before, that they truly were in doubtful/ suspicious doubt/suspicion. 
The praise/gratitude (is) to God creator/originator (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, making/creating/manipulating the angels (as) messengers (owners) of wings/sides two two/twos, and three/threes, and fours, He increases in the creation what He wills/wants, that truly God (is) on every thing capable/able.
What God opens/discloses to the people from mercy so (there is) no withholder/refrainer to it, and what He holds/grasps , so (there is) no sender to it from after Him, and He is the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious .
You, you the people, remember/mention God's blessing on you, is (there) from (a) creator other than God, (who) provides for you from the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth? (There is) no God except Him, so where/how (do) you lie/turn away?
And if they deny/falsify you , so messengers from before you had been denied/falsified , to God return the matters/affairs.
You, you the people, that truly God's promise (is) true/truth , so let not the life the present/worldly life deceive/tempt you, and nor the deceit/temptation deceive/tempt you with God.
That truly the devil (is) for you an enemy, so take him (as) an enemy, truly/indeed he calls his group/party to be from the blazing's/inflamed's/(inferno's) owners/company .
Those who disbelieved, for them (is) a strong (severe) torture, and those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them (is) a forgiveness and great reward .
Is who his bad/evil deed was decorated/beautified to (for) him, so he saw it (as) good/beautiful, so then God misguides whom He wills/wants, and He guides whom He wills/wants, so do not (let) your self go/wipe out on (for) them (in) grief/sorrow, that truly God (is) knowledgeable with what they make/do .
And God is who sent the winds/breezes, so it erupts and spreads clouds, so We drove it to a dead country/land , so We revived with it the land/Earth after its death/lifelessness, as/like that (is) the revival/resurrection.
Who was wanting the glory/might , so to God (is) the glory/might all/all together, to Him ascends/climbs the words/expressions, the good/beautiful , and the deed the correct/righteous He raises it; and those who scheme the sins/crimes, for them (is) a strong (severe) torture, and (the) schemes (of) those it perishes/fails .
And God created you from dust/earth then from a drop/male's or female's secretion , then He made you pairs/couples , and no female conceives/(is) pregnant with and nor gives birth/drops except with His knowledge, and no long lived/aged be granted long life, and nor be reduced (shortened) from his lifetime except in a Book/fate/term , that truly that (is) on God easy/little .
And the two seas/oceans do not become equal/alike, that (is) fresh/sweet very sweet/fresh pleasant tasting its drink, and that (is) salty, salty and bitter, and from each/all you eat a soft/tender meat , and you bring out a jewel/ornament you wear/dress it, and you see the ship/ships in it audibly cutting through to ask/desire from His grace/favour , and maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
He makes the night to enter/penetrate in the daytime, and He makes the daytime to enter/penetrate in the night, and He manipulated/subjugated the sun and the moon, each passes/orbits to a named/identified term/time, that one (is) God your Lord, for Him (is) the ownership/kingdom , and those whom you call from other than Him, they do not own/possess from (a) thin layer between the date and its pit/anything.
If you call them they do not hear your call/request/prayer, and if they heard/listened, they would not have answered/replied to you, and (on) the Resurrection Day they disbelieve with your sharing (them)/making (them) partners (with God), and non informs you equal/alike (to) an expert/experienced.
You, you the people, you are the poor/needy/deprived to God, and He is the rich, the praiseworthy/commendable.
If He wills/wants He makes you go away/eliminates you and He comes with a new creation.
And that (is) not with a dear/mighty on God.
And no sinner/loader/burdener (F) (self) carries/bears/sins (F) another's sin/load/burden , and if she/it calls (a) burdened/loaded (F) (self) to (remove) her/its weight/load , nothing from it (will) be carried/lifted a thing, and even if it was/is (to) of relations , truly/indeed you warn/give notice (to) those who fear their Lord with the unseen/hidden and they kept up the prayers, and who purifies , so but he purifies to/for him self, and to God (is) the end/destination.
And the blind and the seeing/understanding , do not become equal/alike.
And nor the darknesses, and nor the light.
And nor the shade , and nor the hot wind/sun's heat .
And (they) do not become equal/alike, the alive and nor the deads, that truly God makes whom He wills/wants hear/listen , and you are not with making whom (are) in the graves/burial places hear/listen.
That you are except a warner/giver of notice.
That We sent you with the truth (as) an announcer of good news and a warner/giver of notice, and (there is) not from a nation/generation/century except past/expired in it a warner/giver of notice.
And if they deny/falsify you so those from before them had denied/falsified, their messengers (who) came to them with the evidences, and The Books, and The Book the luminous/enlightening .
Then I took/received/punished those who disbelieved, so how was My severity (anger) .
Do you not see/understand that God descended from the sky water, so We brought out with it fruits its colours (are) different, and from mountains white sides/river banks and red, its colours (are) different, and blacks, very blacks?
And from the people, and the walkers/creepers/crawlers , and the camels/livestock its colours (are) different, as/like that, but/truly God fears from His worshippers/slaves the learned ones/knowledgeable (from God's slaves/worshippers, only the learned ones/knowledgeable fear Him), that truly God (is) glorious/mighty ,forgiving.
That truly those who read/recite God's Book and kept up the prayers, and they spent from what We provided for them secretly and openly/publicly , they hope/expect (a) commercial trade it will never/not be destroyed/fail .
To fulfill/complete their rewards , and He increases them from His grace/favour, that He truly is forgiving, thankful/grateful.
And what We inspired/transmitted to you from The Book , it is the truth confirming to what (is) between his hands, that truly God (is) with His worshippers/slaves expert/experienced (E), seeing/knowing .
Then We made The Book be inherited (by) those whom We cho se/purified from Our worshippers/slaves , so from them who (is) unjust/oppressive to him self, and from them economizing/moderate , and from them racing/surpassing/preceding with the goodnesses/generosity with God's permission/pardon, that it is the grace/favour , the great .
Treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, they enter it, (and) they will be bejeweled/decorated in it from bracelets from gold and pearls, and their cover/dress in it (is from) silk.
And they said: "The praise/gratitude (is) to God who took away/eliminated from us the sadness/grief, that truly our Lord (is) forgiving (E) thanked."
Who placed us/made us occupy (the) house/home (of) the residence/position, from His grace/favour ;Hardship/fatigue does not touch us in it, and nor exhaustion touches us in it.
And those who disbelieved, for them (is) Hell's fire , (they) do not be destroyed on them, so they die (they do not die), and nor (they) be reduced/lightened from its torture on them, as/like that We reimburse every/each (insistent) disbeliever.
And they, they cry out/scream for help in it: "Our Lord bring us out , we make/do correct/righteous deeds, other than (what) we were making/doing ." Did We not grant you long life in it? Who remembers does not remember in it, (We gave you a long life to remember but you chose not to), and the warner/giver of notice came to you, so taste/experience, so (there is) none from a savior/victorior to the unjust/oppressive.
That truly God (is) knower (of) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's unseen/covered , that He truly is knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts).
He is who made/put you (as) caliphs/successors and replacers in the earth/Planet Earth, so who disbelieved so on him (is) his disbelief, and the disbeliever's disbelief does not increase (them) at their Lord except abhorrence/hatred , the disbeliever's disbelief does not increase (them) except loss/misguidance and perishment.
Say: "Did you see/understand your partners (with God) those whom you call from other than God? Show me/make me understand what they created from the earth/Planet Earth, or for them (is) a share/partnership in the skies/space, or We gave/brought them a Book so they are on an evidence from it? But that truly the unjust/oppressive promise some of them (to) some (each other) except deceit/temptation." 
That truly God holds/grasps/seizes the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth that (E) they (B) vanish/cease to exist , and if (E) they (B) vanished/ceased to exist , that truly/if (some one) grasped/seized them (B) from anyone from after Him, that He truly was/is clement , forgiving (God is the only one that holds the skies and earth in place, and when they do vanish at the resurrection, no one will hold them in place).
And they swore/made oath by God their rights'/oath's utmost if (E) a warner/giver of notice came to them they will be/become more guided than any (of) the nations , so when a warner/giver of notice came to them, did not (nothing) increased them except hastening away with aversion .
Arrogance in the earth/Planet Earth, and the bad's/evil's/harm's deceit/scheme , does not surround/ afflict except with its people , so do they wait (for) the first's/beginner's manner/law ? So you will never/not find for God's law/manner (an) exchange/replacement , and you will never/not find for God's law/manner a change/movement .
Do they not walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth so they see/think about how was (the) end/turn (result of) those from before them? And they were stronger than them (in) strength/power , and nothing from a thing was to disable/frustrate Him, God, in the skies/space and nor in the earth/Planet Earth, that He truly was/is knowledgeable, capable/able .
And if God punishes/takes the people because (of) what they earned/acquired/won , He would not have left on its back/surface/top from a walker/creeper/crawler , and but He delays them to a named/identified term/time, so if their term/time came, so then God was/is with His worshippers/slaves seeing/knowing/understanding. 
Y S .
And the Koran , the wise/judicious.
That you are from (E) the messengers.
On a straight/direct/balanced road/way.
Descent (from) the glorious/mighty, the merciful .
To warn/give notice (E) (to) a nation, their fathers were not warned/given notice, so they are ignoring/neglecting/disregarding.
The saying/word had been (E) true/deserved on most of them, so they do not believe.
We (E) put/made in their necks leather/iron collars or handcuffs, so it is to the chins/beards, so they are being forced to raise their heads while lowering their eyes from humility.
And We put/made from between their hands a barrier , and from behind them a barrier , so We covered/afflicted them , so they do not see/look/understand.
And (it is) equal/alike on (to) them had you warned/given them notice, or you did not warn/give them notice, they do not believe.
But/truly you warn/give notice (to) whom followed the reminder/remembrance and feared the merciful with the unseen/hidden , so announce good news to him with forgiveness, and (an) honored/generous reward .
We (E), We, We revive/make alive the deads and We write/dictate what they advanced/introduced , and their tracks/marks/signs, and every thing We counted/controlled/calculated it in a clear/evident example (model/guide) .
And give for them an example/proverb (of) the village's/urban city's owners/company , when the messengers came to them.
When We sent to them two, so they denied/falsified them (B) , so We strengthened/ supported with a third, so they said: "We (E) (are) sent/being sent to you."
They said: "You are not except humans equal/alike to us , and the merciful did not descend from a thing, that truly you are except lying/denying/falsifying."
They said: "Our Lord knows, that we are to you sent/messengers (E)."
And nothing (is) on us except the information/communication, the clear/evident .
They said: "That we, we had a bad omen with you (you are a bad omen to us) if (E) you did not end/terminate/stop we will stone you (E), and a painful torture from us will touch you (E)."
They said: "Your omen (fate/future is) with you, (even if you) are, you were reminded, but you are a nation (of) wasters/extravagators ."
And from (the) farthest of the city/town came a man walking quickly he said: "You my nation, follow the messengers."
Follow who does not ask/question you (for) a reward/wage/fee, and they are guided.
And why for me (that) I not worship who created me/brought me into being , and to him you are being returned.
Do I take from other than Him gods, if the merciful wants/intends me with harm, (so) their mediation does not enrich/suffice me from me a thing, and they do not rescue/save me.
That I am then in (E) clear/evident misguidance.
That I believed with (in) your Lord, so hear/listen to me.
(It) was/is said: "Enter the Paradise." He said: "Oh if only my nation know."
With what my Lord forgave for me, and He made/put me from the honoured.
And We did not descend on his nation from after him from soldiers/warriors from the sky/space, and We were not sent descending.
That (E) (it) was except one loud strong cry/torture raid so then they are still/silent/dead.
Oh grief/sorrow on the slaves/servants , none from a messenger comes to them, except (that) they were with him mocking/making fun.
Do they not see/understand how many We destroyed before them from the generations/peoples of eras/centuries, that they, to them they do not return?
And that (E) each/all (E) all/all together (are) at/by Us, they are made to be present/made to attend.
And an evidence/sign for them (is) the land/Earth the dead, We revived it, and We brought out from it seeds/grains, so from it they eat.
And We made/put in it treed gardens from palm trees and grapes, and We caused to flow/burst in it from the water springs/water wells.
To eat from its fruit, and what their hands made/did/worked it, so do they not thank/be grateful?
Praise/glory (to) who created the pairs/kinds all of it, from what the land/Earth prouts/grows, and from themselves and from what they do not know.
And an evidence/sign for them (is) the night, We skin off/uncover from it the daytime, so then they are darkened/in darkness.
And the sun passes/orbits to an establishment/affixation to it, that (is) the glorious'/mighty's predestination/evaluation .
And the moon We predestined/evaluated it (in) sequences/descents until it returned as/like the palm tree's branch/date bunch, the old .
The sun should not (be) to it that it catches up/overtakes/reaches the moon, and nor the night (is) surpassing/preceding the daytime, and each (is) in (an) orbit/circuit floating.
And an evidence/sign for them (is) that We, We carried/loaded their descendants in the ship/ships, the full/loaded. 
And We created for them from similar/equal/alike to it, what they ride/board .
And if We will/want We drown/sink them, so (there be) no cries for help/aiders for them, and nor they be rescued/saved.
Except mercy from Us, and a long life/enjoyment to a time .
And if (it) was said to them: "Fear and obey what (is) between your hands and what (is) behind you, maybe/perhaps you attain mercy."
And none from an evidence/sign/verse from their Lord's evidences/signs/verses comes to them except they were from it objecting/opposing/turning away.
And if (it) was said to them: "Spend from what God provided for you." Those who disbelieved said to those who believed: "Do we feed whom if God wanted/willed He fed him? That truly you are in except clear/evident misguidance."
And they say: "When (is) that the promise, if you were truthful?"
They do not wait except (for) one loud strong cry/torture raid (that) punishes/punishes them, and (while) they are disputing/controverting with each other .
So they are not being able (of) direction/influence , and nor to their families they return.
And (it) was blown in the horn/bugle so then they are from the graves to their Lord they drop/rush down .
They said: "Oh our calamity/scandal who sent/woke us up from our place of sleep? That (is) what the merciful promised and the messengers were truthful."
That truly (it) was except one loud strong cry/torture raid, so then they are all/all together at Us, they are made to be present/made to attend.
So the day/today no self be caused injustice to/be oppressed a thing, and you are not being reimbursed except (for) what you were making/doing .
That the Paradises' friends/company the day/today (are) in work/occupation/function enjoying/joyful/humorous.
They and their spouses (are) in shades on the luxurious beds/couches leaning on/reclining on .
For them in it (are) fruits, and for them what they call/wish/desire.
A greeting/safety/security , a word/saying from a merciful Lord.
And be distinguished/separated the day/today, oh you, the criminals/sinners.
Did I not entrust/make a contract to you, Adam's sons and daughters, that do not worship the devil ,that he truly is for you a clear/evident enemy?
And that (E) worship Me, that (is) a straight/direct road/way?
And he (the devil) had (E) misguided many nations/creations from you, were you not being understanding/comprehending ?
This (is) Hell which you were being promised.
The day/today roast/suffer/burn (from) it because (of) what you were disbelieving. 
The day/today We seal off/stamp on their mouths, and their hands converse/speak to Us , and their feet witness/testify with what they were earning/acquiring .
And if We will/want We would have wiped out/destroyed on their eyes/sights, so they raced/surpassed/preceded the road/way, so how (do) they see/understand ?
And if We will/want We would have transformed them to worse shape/metamorphosed them on their capacity/place/position, so they were not able (of) passing/preceding/completing , and nor they return.
And whom We grant him long life We reverse him (make him senile) in the creation, do they not reason/understand ?
And We did not teach/instruct him the poetry, and (it) should not (be) for him that it is except (a) reminder and (a) clear/evident Koran .
To warn/give notice to who was/is alive and the opinion and belief/saying/word becomes deserved/truth on the disbelievers.
Did they not see/understand that We created for them from what Our hands made/did camels/livestock, so they are for it owning/possessing?
And We manipulated/eased it for them, so from it (is) their riding , and from it they eat?
And for them in it (are) benefits/uses and drinking places, so do they not thank/be grateful?
And they took from other than God, gods, maybe/perhaps they be given victory/aid.
They are not being able (of) giving them victory/aiding them, and they are for them soldiers/warriors being made to be present/attend.
So let not their word/opinion and belief to sadden/make you grievous, that We know what they keep secret and what they declare/publicize .
Does not the human/mankind see/understand that We created him from a drop/male's or female's secretion , so then he is a clear/evident disputer/adversary/arguer?
And he gave to us an example/proverb, and he forgot his creation, he said: "Who revives/makes alive the bones and (while) it is decayed/decomposed?"
Say: "Revives/makes it alive (God) who created/originated it (the) first/beginning time, and He is with every/each creation knowledgeable."
Who created/made/put for you from the trees the green a fire, so then you are from it igniting/kindling .
Or is not who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, with capable on that He creates equal/alike to them . Yes/certainly and He is the creator, the knowledgeable.
But/truly His order/command if He wanted/willed a thing, (is) that He says to it: "Be." so it becomes.
So praise/glory (to) who with His hands (are) every thing's ownership/might and power , and to Him you are being returned. 
And the expanded and motionless wings in a row, arranged .
So the preventing/deterring , preventing/deterring/ousting .
So the reading/reciting/following, mentioning/remembering .
That truly your Lord (is) one (E) .
Lord (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B), and Lord (of) the sun rises/easts.
That We decorated/beautified the sky/space (of) the present world with the stars'/planets' decoration/beauty .
And a protection/guarding from every/each rebellious/mutinous devil.
They do not hear/listen (E) to the nobles/assembly the highest/mightiest/most dignified, and they be thrown/hurled from every/each side/direction.
Expelled/driven away , and for them (is) a permanent/continuous/lasting torture.
Except who snatched the one snatch, so a light from a fire source/a star lit/ignited/penetrating followed him.
So ask/take their opinion , are they a stronger creation, or who We created? That We created them from very sticky mud/clay .
But you wondered/were astonished/were surprised, and they humiliate/mock/undermine/ridicule .
And if they were reminded, they do not mention/remember .
And if they saw/understood an evidence/sign/verse, they humiliate/mock/ridicule/undermine.
And they said: "That truly this (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery.
Is (it that) if we died and we were dust and bones, are we being resurrected/revived (E)?
Or our fathers the first/beginners?"
Say: "Yes, and you are degraded/lowly ."
So but it is a one cry to drive out , so then they are looking/seeing .
And they said: "Oh our calamity/scandal that, it is the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day ."
That (is) the Judgment Day/Separation Day/Resurrection Day which you were with it lying/denying/falsifying.
Gather those who were unjust/oppressive and their spouses , and what they were worshipping.
From other than God, so guide them to the Hell's road/way.
And stop/suspend them , that they are questioned.
And what (is it) for you, you do not give victory/aid?
But they are the day/today submitting/surrendering.
And some of them approached/came on (to) some, they ask/question each other.
They said: "That you were coming to us from the right (side)."
They said: "But you were not being believing."
And (there) was not from power/control for us over you, but you were a tyrannizing/arrogant nation.
So became deserved on us our Lord's word/saying , that we (are) tasting/experiencing.
So we misguided/lured you , that we were misguiding .
So then they are (on) that day in the torture sharing.
We, like that, We make/do with the criminals/sinners.
That they truly were if (it) was said to them: "No God except god" they be arrogant.
And they say: "Are we to leave our gods to a mad/insane poet?"
But He came with the truth and he confirmed the messengers.
That you are tasting/experiencing the torture, the painful.
And you are not being reimbursed except (for) what you were making/doing/working.
Except God's worshippers/slaves , the faithful/loyal .
Those, for them (is) a known provision .
Fruits, and they are honoured.
In the blessed/comfort and ease treed gardens/paradises.
On beds/sofas facing each other .
Being circled/walked around on them with a cup/container to drink from/wine from goodness .
White (a) delight/pleasure to the drinking.
Destruction/intoxication (is) not in it, nor they be drunk/made to loose their minds/drained/exhausted from it.
And at them the eye's/eyelid's confining/limiting/restricting big beautiful eyes.
As though they are (F) protected/covered whites/eggs.
So some of them approached/came on (to) some, they ask/question each other.
A speaker from them said: "That I, (there) was for me (a) companion ."
He says: "You are (E) from the confirming/charity givers."
Is (it that) if we died, and we were dust and bones are we indebted (E)?
He said: "Are you knowing/seeing/looking?"
So he looked/saw, so he saw him in the Hell's middle .
He said: "By God if you were about to to make me fall/ruin (E) ."
And where it not for my Lord's blessing/goodness I would have been from the made present/attending.
So are we not with dying?
Except our death/lifelessness the first/beginning, and we are not with being tortured.
That this it is (E) the winning/success the great .
Similar/equal/alike to this, so the makers/doers/workers, should make/do/work.
Is that a better place of descent or the deadly food's tree?
That We made/put it (as) a test/charm to the unjust/oppressive. 
That it is a tree it emerges in the Hell's source/root.
Its first fruit of the season as though it (is) the devils' heads/tops .
So then they are eating exaggerated/gluttons from it, so they are filling from it the bellies/insides.
Then for them on it (is) a mixture/heat (E) from hot/cold water/red hot coal .
Then that their return (is) to (E) the Hell .
That they truly found their fathers misguided.
So they are on their tracks/marks/signs rushing disturbedly .
And most of the first/beginners had been (E) misguided before them.
And We had (E) sent in (between) them warners/givers of notice.
So look/see/wonder about how was the warned's/given notice's end/turn (result).
Except God's worshippers/slaves , the faithful/loyal/devoted.
And Noah had called/cried (to) Us, so blessed/praised (E) (are) the answerers/repliers.
And We saved/rescued him and his family/relation from the grief, hardship and suffering the great.
And We made/put his descendants, they are the remaining .
And We left on him in the lasts .
Peace/security on Noah in the creations are together/(universes).
We (E) like that, We reimburse the good doers.
That he truly is from Our worshippers/slaves , the believers.
Then We drowned/sunk the others/lasts .
And that truly from his group/party/follower (was) Abraham (E).
When he came (to) his Lord with a sound/safe heart/mind .
When he said to his father and nation: "What (do) you worship?"
Are falsified gods from other than God (what) you want/intend ?
So what (is) your thought/assumption with (about) the creations all together's/ (universes') Lord?
So he looked/saw a glance/consideration in the stars/planets.
So he said: "That I am sick/ill ."
So they turned away from him giving their backs.
So he conned his way to their gods, so he said: "Do you not eat?"
Why for you, you do not speak?
So he conned his way on them moving/striking with the right (hand).
So they (his nation) approached/came to him hurrying/hastening.
He said: "Do you worship what you carve out/cut ?"
And God created you and what you make/do ?
They said: "Build/construct for him a building/structure, so throw him away in the place of intense heat/roaring fire ." 
So they intended/wanted a conspiracy/harm with (for) him, so We made/put them the lowest/meanest.
And he said: "That I am going/going away to my Lord, he will guide me."
My Lord grant/present (for) me from the correct/righteous.
So We announced good news to him with a clement boy .
So when he reached the struggle/endeavor with him, he said you my son: "That I, I see/understand in the sleep/dream that I, I slaughter you/cut your throat, so look/wonder about/consider what you see/understand." He said: "You my father, make/do what you are being ordered/commanded, so you will find me, if God wills/wants from the patient."
So when they (B) submitted/surrounded and he pulled/pushed/followed him to the foreheads.
And We called him: "That you Abraham."
You had confirmed the dream, We (E), like that We reimburse the good doers.
That truly that it is (E) the test, the clear/evident .
And We substituted him with a great slaughtered (animal).
And We left on him in the others/lasts .
Safety/security/greeting on Abraham.
As/like that We reimburse the good doers.
That he truly is from Our worshippers/slaves the believers.
And We announced good news to him (of) Isaac a prophet from the correct/righteous.
And We blessed on him and on Isaac, and from their (B)'s descendants, (are) good doers, and (a) clear/evident unjust/oppressive to himself.
And We had blessed on Moses and Aaron.
And We saved/rescued them (B) and their (B)'s nation from the grief/hardship and suffering, the great.
And We gave them victory, so they were, they, the defeators/conquerors.
And We gave/brought them (B) The Book , the clear/evident .
And We guided them (B) the road/way, the straight/direct .
And We left on them (B) in the others/lasts .
Safety/security/greeting on Moses and Aaron.
We (E), like that We reimburse the good doers.
That they truly are from Our worshippers/slaves the believers.
And that Elias (is) from (E) the messengers.
When he said to his nation: "Do you not fear and obey?"
Do you call an idol statue/master , and you leave the creator's best ?
God (is) your Lord, and your fathers'/forefathers' lord the first/beginners.
So they lied/denied/falsified him, so they truly are being made to be present/attend (E).
Except God's worshippers/slaves , the faithful/loyal/devoted. 
And We left on him in the others/lasts .
Safety/security/greeting on Elias .
We, like that We reimburse the good doers.
That he truly (is) from Our worshippers/slaves the believers.
And that truly Lot (was) from (E) the messengers.
When We saved/rescued him and his family/people all/all together.
Except old/weak (his wife was) in the remaining behind.
Then We destroyed the others/lasts .
And that you, you pass (E) on them in the morning/day break.
And at the night, so do you not reason/understand/comprehend?
And that truly Jonah (was) from (E) the messengers.
When he escaped/took shelter to the ship/ships, the full/loaded.
So he drew lots with (gambled) , so he was from the annulled/slipped.
So the large fish/whale swallowed/swallowed him quickly, and (while) he is blameworthy/blamed.
So had it not been for that he (was) from the praising/glorifying.
He would have stayed/remained in its belly/inside to a day/time they be sent/resurrected/revived.
So We casted him off/discarded him at the open space and (while) he is sick/ill .
And We sprouted/grew on him a tree from a plant without a stem/squashes and cucumbers.
And We sent him to one hundred thousand or they increase/exceed.
So they believed, so We gave them long life/made them enjoy to a time/period of time .
So ask/take their opinion is to your Lord the daughters, and for them (are) the sons ?
Or We created the angels (as) females and they are witnessing/testifying .
Is (it) not that they truly are from their lies/falsehood, they say (E):
God gave birth . And that they truly are lying/denying/falsifying (E).
He chose/purified the daughters on/over the sons.
What (is) for you how you judge/rule?
Do you not mention/remember ?
Or for you (is) a clear/evident proof/evidence ?
So come/bring with your Book if you were truthful.
And they made/put between Him and between the Jinns (a) relationship/kinship and the Jinns had (E) known that they truly are being made to be present/attend (E).
God's praise/glory from/about what they describe/categorize.
Except God's worshippers/slaves, the faithful/loyal/devoted.
So you truly are, and what you worship.
You are not on Him/it with charming/misguiding .
Except whom he is entering into fire/roasting the Hell  
(The angels say): "And none for Us except for him (is) a known place and time/position/status ."
And that We, We are (E) the liners/arrangers.
And that We, We are (E) the praising/glorifying.
And if they (the disbelievers) were saying (E):
If that (E) at us (is) a reminder/remembrance from the first/beginners.
We would have been God's worshippers/slaves , the faithful/loyal/devoted.
So they disbelieved with (in) Him, so they will know.
And Our words/expressions/speech had (E) preceded to Our worshippers/slaves the messengers.
That they truly, they are (E) the victorious.
And that (E) Our soldiers/warriors , they are (E) the defeators/conquerors.
So turn away from them until a time/period of time .
And make them see/understand, so they will/shall see/look/understand.
Are they with Our torture urging/hastening .
So if it (the torture) descended at their court/yard, so it became (a) bad/evil/harmful morning/day break (of) the warned/given notice.
And turn away from them until a time/period of time .
And see/understand , so they will see/understand .
Your Lord's praise/glory, Lord (of) the glory/might/power about what they describe/categorize.
And a safety/security/greeting on the messengers.
And the praise/gratitude (is) to God, the creations all together's/(universes') Lord. 
S/C/SAD and the Koran (owner) of the reminder/remembrance .
But those who disbelieved (are) in glory/might/power and defiance/animosity .
How many from (a) people of one era/generation We destroyed from before them? So they called: "And it is not the time, time for escape (expression) ."
And they were wondering/astonished/surprised that (a) warner/giver of notice came to them from them, and the disbelievers said: "That (is a) liar/denier/falsifier, (a) magician/sorcerer."
Did he make the gods one god? That (E) that (is an) astounding/surprising thing (E).
And the assembly/nobles set out that: "Walk and be patient on your gods, that (E) (is) a thing (E) is being wanted/intended ."
We did not hear/listen with that in the religion/faith the last, that (E) that is except creations/inventions.
Is the reminder/remembrance descended on (to) him from between us? But they are in doubt/suspicion from My remembrance/reminder, but till now they did not taste/experience My torture.
Or at them (is) your Lord's safes/storages (of) mercy, the glorious/mighty the grantor/presenter?
Or for them (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's and what (is) between them (B)'s ownership/kingdom ? So they should ascend/climb in the reasons/connections .
Soldiers/warriors from the groups/parties at that place and time (are) defeated .
Noah's, and Aad's, and Pharaoh's nation, (owner) of the stakes/pegs/nails denied/falsified before them.
And Thamud and Lot's nation, and owners/company (of) the thicket/dense tangled trees, those are the groups/parties.
That (E) each/all except they did (without exception) lied/denied/falsified the messengers, so (they) deserved My punishment.
And those do not look/see/watch except (for) one loud strong cry/torture raid, (there is) nothing from (a) recovery/awakening for it.
And they said: "Our Lord hurry/hasten/speed for us our share/prize voucher/accounting book before the Account Day/Resurrection Day."
Be patient on what they say, and mention/remember Our worshipper/slave David, (owner) of the power/strength/force, that he truly is repentant/returning.
That We, We manipulated/subjugated the mountains with him, they praise/glorify at the evening/first darkness and the sun rise.
And the birds gathered, each/all for him (are) returning .
And We strengthened/supported his ownership/kingdom, and We gave/brought him the wisdom and judgment/decision (of) the speech/address/conversation.
Did information/news (of) the disputers/adversaries/arguers come to you, when they climbed/scaled the center of the house/center of the assembly ?
When they entered on (to) David, so He was frightened/terrified from them, they said: "Do not fear (we are) two disputers/adversaries/arguers, some of us oppressed/transgressed on some (over each other), so judge/rule between us with the truth/just , and do not be unjust , and guide us to the road's/way's middle/straightness ."
That, this (is) my brother for him (are) nine and ninety ewes/female sheep, and for me (is) one ewe/female sheep. So he said: 'Let me sponsor/maintain it.' And he overwhelmed me in the speech/conversation .
He (David) said: "He had (E) caused injustice to you/oppressed you with requesting your ewe/female sheep to his ewes/female sheep, and that many from the associates/company some of them oppress/transgress (E) on some (each other) except those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and little/few what they are." And David doubted/suspected that We tested him so he asked for forgiveness (from) his Lord, and he fell down bowing, and He repented/obeyed .
So We forgave for him that, and that for him at Us (is) an advancement/rank/degree (E) and (a) good/beautiful return.
You David, that We made/put you (as) a caliph/leader in the land/Earth , so judge/rule between the people with the truth/just , and do not follow the self attraction for desire , so it misguides you from God's way/path , that those who misguide from God's way/path, for them (is) a strong (severe) torture because (of) what they forgot the Account Day/Resurrection Day.
And We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) wastefully/falsely , that is those who disbelieved's doubt/suspicion, so calamity/scandal to those who disbelieved from the fire .
Or We make/put those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds as/like the corrupting in the earth/Planet Earth, or We make/put the fearing and obeying as/like the debauchers/corrupters.
A Book We descended it to you blessed, (so) they consider (E) its verses/ evidences and (to the owner's) of the pure minds/hearts to mention/ remember .
And We granted to David Soliman, blessed/praised the slave/servant that he truly is repentant
When the horses standing on three legs and the edge of the fourth hoof touching the ground (of) the beautiful necks were displayed/exhibited/showed on (to) him at the evening/first darkness .
He said: "That I , I loved/liked love (of) the good/honour/wealth on (over) mentioning/remembering my Lord, until it became hidden/concealed (disappeared) at the divider/protection ."
Return it on (to) me, so he started and continued with the shins/legs, and the necks rubbing/petting/anointing .
And We had (E) tested/charmed Soliman and We threw on his throne/seat a body then he repented .
He said: "My Lord forgive for me, and grant/present for me an ownership/kingdom (that) should not be to anyone from after me, that You, You are the grantor/presenter." 
So We manipulated/subjugated for him the wind/breeze it flows/passes with his order/command, soft/gentle where/when it struck/marked .
And the devils all/each (is a) builder/constructor and diver.
And others tied to each other in the shackles/chairs .
That (is) Our granting , so bless (do kind acts) and hold/seize without counting .
And that (E) for him at Us (is) an approachment/degree/rank (E) and a good/beautiful return.
And remember/mention Our worshipper/slave Job, when he called/cried (to) his Lord: "That I, the devil touched me with hardship/fatigue/disease and torture."
Run/move/push with your foot, that (is a) cool/cold washing place/water, and a drink.
And We granted/presented to him his family and equal to them with them, mercy from Us and a reminder/remembrance to (owners) of the pure minds/hearts .
And take with your hand a handful of grass/a handful, so strike/beat with it, and do not break oath, that We, We found him patient blessed/praised the slave/servant , that he truly is repentant .
And remember/mention Our worshippers/slaves Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, (owners of) the hands, and the eyesights/knowledge.
That We made them become faithful/clear/purified with clear/pure reminder/remembrance (of) the House/Home .
And they, they are at Us from (E) the chosen/purified, the good/honoured.
And remember/mention, Ishmael, and Elija (owner) of the cloth saddle , and each/all (are) from the good/honoured.
That is a reminder, and that truly to the fearing and obeying (is a) good/beautiful (E) return.
Treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residences, the doors/entrances (are) opened for them.
Leaning/reclining in it, they call in it with much/many fruits, and a drink .
And at them (are) the eyes'/eye lids' confining/limiting/restricting, same age/not aging.
That (is) what you are being promised to the Account Day/Resurrection Day.
That (E) this (is) Our provision (E), (there is) nothing from (a) depletion from it.
This, and that truly to the tyrannizing/arrogant (is a) bad/evil (E) return.
Hell they roast/suffer (from) it, so how bad (are) the beds (destination).
This, so they will taste/experience it hot/cold water , and cold/decayed/rotten.
And other/another from its likeness/similarity spouses .
This (is a) group/crowd bursting/plunging with you, (there is) no welcome with (for) them, that they are, they are entering/suffering the fire .
They said: "But you are (there is) no welcome with (for) you, you advanced/introduced it for us." So how bad (is) the settlement/decision ?
They said: "Our Lord who advanced/introduced this for us, so increase him (with) a double torture in the fire ."
And they said: "Why (is it) for us, we do not see men, we were, we count them from the bad/evil/harmful?" 
We took them (by) mocking/ridiculing or the eyesights/knowledge deviated/turned away from them?
That truly that (is) true/fact (E) , the fire's people dispute/ controvert/argue (among them selves).
Say: "Truly I am (a) warner/giver of notice, and (there is) none from a God, except God the one, the defeator/conqueror ."
The skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's Lord, and what (is) between them (B), the glorious/mighty ,the forgiving often/forgiver.
Say: "Is it (a) great news/information?"
You are from it objecting/opposing .
(There) was not from knowledge to me with the group/assembly/nobles, the highest/mightiest when they dispute/controvert/argue.
That (it) is (only) inspired/transmitted to me except that I am a clear/evident warner/giver of notice."
When your Lord said to the angels: "That I am creating a human from mud/clay ."
So if I straightened him, and I blew in him from My Soul/Spirit , so fall/come to him prostrating.
So the angels prostrated all of them, all/all together.
Except Satan he became arrogant, and was/is from the disbelievers.
He said: "You Satan , what prevented/prohibited you that you prostrate to what I created with My hands, did you become arrogant, or you were from the high and mighty?"
He said: "I am better than him, You created me from fire and You created him from mud/clay ."
He said: "So get out/emerge from it, so that you are cursed/expelled."
And that (E) on you (is) My curse/torture/expulsion to the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day .
He said: "My Lord so give me time/delay me to a day/time they be sent/resurrected/revived."
He said: "So that you are from the given time/delayed ."
To day/time (of) the time, the known.
He said: "So with Your glory/might , I will misguide/lure them (E) all/all together."
Except Your worshippers/slaves from them, the faithful/devoted
He said: So the truth and the truth I say:"
I will fill (E) Hell from you and from who followed you from them all/all together.
Say: "I do not ask/question you on it from a reward/wage/fee, and I am not from the pretentious/meddling .
That (E) it is except a reminder/remembrance to the creations all together/(universes).
And you will know (E) its news/information after a time/period of time
The Book's descent from God, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
That We, We descended to you The Book with the truth so worship God faithful, loyal/devoted to him (in) the religion.
Is not to God the religion the clear/pure? And those who took from other than Him guardians/allies (they say): We do not worship them except to near/approach us to God, (an) approachment/ degree ." That truly God judges/rules between them in what they are in it differing/disputing , that truly God does not guide who he is lying/denying/falsifying , (an insistent) disbeliever.
If God wanted/intended that (E) He takes a child (son), He would have chosen/purified from who He created, what He wills/wants, His praise/glory, He is God, the one the defeator/conqueror (E) .
He created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, with the truth . He rotates/rolls the night on (to) the daytime, and He rotates/rolls the daytime on (to) the night, and He manipulated/subjugated the sun and the moon, each/all flows/orbits to a term/time, named/identified (specified), is He not the glorious/mighty , the forgiving/often forgiver?
He created you from one self , then He made/created from it, its spouse , and He descended for you from the camels/livestock eight pairs/kinds (refer to 6:143 and 6:144), He creates you, in your mothers' bellies/insides, a creation from after a creation, in 3 darknesses (trimesters), that one, (is) God, your Lord, for Him (is) the kingdom/ownership (there is) no god except Him, so how/where (do) you be diverted/misguided ?
If you disbelieve, so then God (is) rich from (without) you, and He does not accept/approve the disbelief to His worshippers/slaves , and if you thank/be grateful He accepts/approves it for you, and no sinner/loader/burdener carries/bears another's sins/load/burden , then to your Lord (is) your return, so He informs you with what you were making/doing , that He truly (is) knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts).
And if harm touched the human, he called his Lord repenting/obeying to Him, then if he made him own a blessing/goodness from Him, he forgot what he was calling to Him from before, and he made/put to God equals (idols) to misguide from His way/path , say: "Live long/enjoy with your disbelief little , that you are from the fire's owners/company "
Or who he is obeying humbly/prolonging the prayer (during) the nights' hours, prostrating and standing/keeping up he fears the end (other life) and hopes/expects his lord's mercy, say: "Do (they) become equal/alike, those who know and those who do not know?" But (owners) of the pure minds/hearts mention/remember.
Say: "You my worshippers/slaves those who believed, fear and obey your Lord, to those who did good in this the present world (is) a goodness/beauty, and God's earth/Planet Earth/land (is) spread/abundant , truly the patient are fulfilled/completed their reward without (an) account/calculation."
Say: "That I, I was ordered/commanded that (E) I worship God, faithful/loyal/devoted (in) the religion."
And I was ordered/commanded to that (E) I be first (of) the Moslems/submitters/ surrenderers.
Say: "That I, I fear if I disobeyed my Lord (from) a great day's/time's torture."
Say: "God, I worship faithful/loyal/devoted to Him (in) my religion."
So worship what you wanted from other that Him, say: "That (E) the losers , those who lost their selves and their families/peoples (on) the Day of the Resurrection , is that not it is the loss , the clear/evident ?"
For them from above them shades from the fire , and from below/beneath them shades, that God He frightens with it His worshippers/slaves , you My worshipper/slaves , so fear and obey Me.
And those who avoided/distanced the idols/every thing worshipped other than God that (E) they worship it, and they repented/obeyed to God, for them (is) the good news, so announce good news (to) My worshippers/slaves .
Those who hear/listen (to) the word/opinion and belief so they follow its best , those are, those whom God guided them, and those, they are (owners) of the pure minds/hearts .
Is who the torture's words became true/deserved on him, so do you save/rescue who is in the fire ?
But those who feared and obeyed their Lord, for them (are) chambers from above it chambers built/constructed, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, God's promise, God does not break the appointment (promise).
Do you not see/understand, that (E) God descended from the sky water, so He made it flow/pass (into) water springs/wells in the Earth/land , then He brings out with it plants/crops its colours (are) different, then (it) dries and yellows so you see it yellow/yellowish, then He makes it broken/debris/crumbs ,that (E) in that (is) a remembrance/reminder (E) to (owners) of the pure minds/hearts .
Is who God delighted/expanded his chest (innermost) to the Islam/submission/ surrender (to God) so he is on light from his Lord; so calamity/scandal to (whom of ) the cruel/hard/merciless (are) their hearts/minds from God's remembrance/reminder, those (are) in clear/evident misguidance.
God descended the information's/speech's best , a Book looking alike/resembling/ similar doubles of twos Koranic verses , (the) skins (of) those who fear their Lord tremble/shiver from it, then their skins and their hearts/minds soften to God's remembrance/reminder, that (is) God's guidance, He guides with it whom He wills/wants, and who God misguides so (there is) none from a guide for him.
Is who fears with his face/front the torture's bad/evil/harm (on) the Resurrection Day, and was said to the unjust/oppressive taste/experience what you were gaining/acquiring .
Those from before them lied/denied/falsified, so the torture came to them from where/when they do not feel/know/sense. 
So God made them taste/experience the shame/disgrace/scandal in the life the present/worldly life, and the end's (other life's) torture (E) (is) greater if they were knowing.
And We had given to the people in this the Koran from every/each example/proverb, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember .
An Arabic a Koran , without/other than of bent/crookedness/indirectness, maybe/perhaps they fear and obey.
God gave an example/proverb (of) a man, adversaries/ill-mannered/quarrelsome partners (subject of controversy is) in him, (and) a man peaceful/secure/without blemish , to a man, do they (B) become equal/alike (in) an example/proverb? The praise/gratitude (is) to God, but most of them do not know.
You truly are dying, and that they truly are dying.
Then you truly are (on) the Resurrection Day at your Lord you dispute/controvert/argue.
So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who lied/denied/falsified on (about) God and lied/denied/falsified with the truth when it came to him, is not in Hell (a) home/residence to the disbelievers?
And who came with the truth, and he confirmed with it, those, they are the fearing and obeying.
For them what they want at their Lord, that (is) the good doers' reimbursement .
(It is for) God to cover/substitute from them (the) worst deeds which they made/did , and He rewards/reimburses their reimbursement with best (of) which they were making/doing .
Is not God with sufficing/protecting His worshipper/slave ? And they frighten you with those who (are) from other than Him, and whom God misguides, so (there is) none from a guide for him.
And whom God guides, so (there is) none from a misguider for him, is not God with glorious/mighty (owner) of revenge/punishment?
And if (E) you asked/questioned them: "Who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth?" They will say (E): "God." Say: "Did you see/understand what you call from other than God, if God wanted/intended me with harm, are they (F) removers/uncoverers (relievers) (of) His harm? Or He wanted/intended me with mercy, are they (F) withholders/seizers (of) His mercy?" Say: "Enough for me God, on Him rely/depend the reliant/dependent ."
Say: "You my nation, make/do on your capacity/position , that I am making/doing so you will/shall know."
Who comes to him (gets a) torture (that) shames/disgraces him and places/resides on him (a) continuous torture.
We (E) descended on (to) you The Book for the people with the truth , so who guided, so to himself, and who misguided so but he misguides on it, and you are not then with a guardian/protector/trustee .
God makes the selves die (at the) time of its death/lifelessness, and which did not die in its sleep , so He holds/seizes which He ordered the death/lifelessness on it, and He sends the other (others) to a named/identified (specified) term/time, that (E) truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation thinking. 
Or they took from other than God mediators, say: "Even if they were not owning/possessing a thing, and nor reasoning/comprehending ?
Say: "To God (is) the mediation all/all together, for Him (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/kingdom, then to Him you are being returned."
And if God was mentioned/remembered alone (the) hearts/minds (of) those who do not believe with the end (other life) became uptight/repulsed , and if those from other than Him were mentioned/remembered then they are announcing good news/rejoicing .
Say: "Oh, You God, creator/bringer to being (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, knower (of) the unseen/hidden and the testimony/presence , You judge/rule between Your worshippers/slaves in what they were in it differing/disputing ."
And if that (E) to those who were unjust/oppressive what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all/all together, and equal to it with it, they would have ransomed/compensated with it from the torture's evil/harm (on) the Resurrection Day, and it appeared to them from God what they were not thinking/supposing.
And it appeared to them (the) sins/crimes (of) what they earned/acquired ; and what they were with it mocking surrounded/encircled with them.
So if harm touched the human/mankind he called Us, then if We gave him generously/granted him a blessing/goodness from Us, he said: "But/truly I got it on knowledge." But it is a test/allurement , and but most of them do not know.
Those from before them had said it, so what they were gaining/acquiring did not enrich/suffice from them.
so struck/marked them sins/crimes (of) what they gained/acquired , and those who caused injustice/oppression from those, sins/crimes (of) what they gained/acquired will mark/strike them ,and they are not with disabling/frustrating.
Do they not see/understand that God spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants, and He is capable/able ? That truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation believing.
Say: "You my worshippers/slaves those who neglected/ignored on themselves, do not despair from God's mercy, that truly God forgives the crimes all/all together, that truly He is the forgiving, the merciful."
And repent/obey to your Lord, and submit/surrender to Him, from before that the torture comes to you, then you do not be given victory/aid.
And follow best (of) what was descended to you from your Lord from before that the torture comes to you suddenly/unexpectedly, and (while) you do not know/feel/sense.
That (E) a self says: "Oh my grief/sadness on what I neglected/abused/wasted in God's side/direction/right, and that truly I was from (E) the humiliators/mockers ."
Or it says: "If that (E) God guided me, I would have been (E) from the fearing and obeying."
Or it says when it sees the torture: "If that (E) for me (is) a return/repeat/second time , so I be from the good doers." 
Yes/certainly, My evidences/verses came to you, so you lied/denied/falsified with it, and you became arrogant, and you were from the disbelievers.
And (on) the Resurrection Day, you see/understand those who lied/denied/falsified on (about) God, their face/fronts (are) blackened, is not in Hell (a) home/residence/dwelling to the arrogant?
And God saves/rescues those who feared and obeyed with their winning/success/triumph , the bad/evil/harm does not touch them, and nor they be sad/grieving.
God (is) creator (of) every thing and He is on every thing a blessor/fulfiller/guardian .
For Him (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's keys/safes (management and control), and those who disbelieved with God's evidences/signs/verses, those, they are the losers .
Say: "So is other than God you order/command me (that) I worship, you the lowly/ignorant ?"
And (it) had been (E) inspired/transmitted to you and to those from before you, if (E) you shared/made partners (with God), your deed will be wasted/invalidated (E) , and you will be (E) from the losers .
But/rather God, so worship, and be from the thankful/grateful.
And they did not evaluate/estimate God, His correct/true evaluation/estimation, and the earth/Planet Earth all/all together (on) the Resurrection Day (is in) His hand hold/grasp , and the skies/space (are) folded/rolled at/by His right , His praise/glory about what they share/make partners (with Him).
And (it) was blown in the horn/bugle/instrument so who (was) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth fainted from thunderous noise/died , except whom God willed/wanted, then (it) was blown in it another (time), so then they are getting up/standing looking .
And the earth/Planet Earth brightened/shined with/from its Lord's light, and The Book/judgment/record was put/laid , and came with the prophets and the witnesses/testifiers/those killed in God's sake (martyrs), and was passed judgment between them with the truth , and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
And every self was fulfilled/completed what it made/did , and He is more knowledgeable about what they make/do.
And those who disbelieved are driven to Hell (in) groups/gangs until when they came to it, (then) its doors/entrances were opened, and its safe keepers said to them: "Did not messengers from you come to you, they read/recite on (to) you your Lord's evidences/verses , and they warn/give you notice (of) this your day/time, this meeting (today's meeting)?" They said: "Yes/certainly." And but the torture's words/expression became deserved/a fact on the disbelievers.
(It) is said: "Enter Hell's doors/entrances, immortally/eternally in it, so how bad (is) the arrogants' residence/dwelling ?"
And those who feared and obeyed their Lord are driven to the Paradise (in) groups/companies until if they came to it, and its doors opened and its safe keepers said to them: "Peace/security/greeting on (to) you, you became good/beautiful/pure, so enter it immortally/eternally." 
And they said: "The praise/glory (is) to God who was truthful to us (in) His promise, and made us inherit the earth/Planet Earth, we reside/settle from the Paradise where/when we will/want, so is blessed/ praised (is) the maker's/doer's reward ."
And you see the angels gazing and surrounding/circling from around the throne , they praise/glorify with their Lord's praise/glory, and was judged between them with the truth and was said: "The praise/gratitude (is) to God, the creations all together's/(universes) Lord." 
H M .
The Book's descent from God, the glorious/mighty , the knowledgeable.
The crime's forgiver, and the repentances' acceptor, strong (severe in) the punishment, (owner) of the wealth/might , (there is) no God except Him, to Him (is) the end/destination.
None argue/dispute in God's evidences/verses except those who disbelieved, so let not their turning/returning in the countries/lands deceive/tempt you.
Noah's nation lied/denied/falsified before them, and the groups/parties from after them, and every/each nation intended/began with their messenger to take/punish him , and they argued/disputed with the falsehood to nullify with it the truth , so I punished/took them so how was My punishment?
And like that, your Lord's word/expression became correct/true on those who disbelieved, that they are the fire's owners/company .
Those who carry/lift the throne and who (is) around/surrounding it, they praise/glorify with their Lord's praise/gratitude/thanks, and they believe with (in) Him, and they ask for forgiveness to (for) those who believed; (say): "Our Lord, you extended/contained/ widened over every thing (with) mercy and knowledge, so forgive to those who repented and they followed Your way/path , and protect them (from) the Hell's torture."
Our Lord, and enter them (into) treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, which You promised them, and who was correct/repaired from their fathers/forefathers, and their spouses , and their descendants, that You are, You are the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
And protect them (from) the sins/crimes; and whom You protect/preserve from the sins/crimes (on) that day, so You had mercy upon him, and that it is the winning/success , the great.
That truly those who disbelieved they are being called: "God's hatred/abhorrence (E) (is) greater than your hatred/abhorrence (to) yourselves if/when you are being called to the faith/belief so you disbelieve."
They said: "Our Lord You made us die two (twice), and You revived us/gave us life two (twice), so we confessed/acknowledged with our crimes, so is (there) from a way/path to getting out/(an) exit?"
This is with that it is if God was called alone, you disbelieved, and if He be shared with/be made a partner with Him, you believe (with that), so the judgment/rule (is) to God, the high/elevated, the great .
He (is) who shows you/makes you understand His verses/evidences , and He descends for you from the sky provision , and none mentions/remembers except who repents/obeys .
So call God faithful/loyal/devoted to him (in) the religion, and even if the disbelievers hated (it).
Raiser/honourer (of) the steps/stages/degrees, (owner) of the throne , He throws the Soul/Spirit from His order/command on (to) whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves to warn/give notice (of) the Meeting Day/Resurrection Day.
A day/time they are emerging/appearing, not a thing from them hides on (from) God; to whom (is) the kingdom/ownership the day/today? To God the one, the defeator/conqueror .
The day/today every/each self is being reimbursed with what it gathered/acquired , no injustice/oppression the day/today, that truly God (is) quick/speedy (in) the account/calculation.
And warn/give notice (of) the Resurrection Day when the hearts/minds (are) at/by the larynxes/voice boxes (throats), holding/suppressing (themselves), (there is) no concerned (relative/friend), and nor a mediator (to) be obeyed to the unjust/oppressive.
He knows the eyes'/sights' betrayal/unfaithfulness (E), and what the chests (innermosts) hide.
And God passes judgment/orders with the truth , and those whom they call from other than Him, they do not pass judgment/order/accomplish with a thing, that truly God, He is the hearing/listening, the seeing/knowing .
Do they not walk/move/ride in the land/Planet Earth , so they see/wonder about how was those who were from before them's end/turn (result)? They, they were, stronger than them (in) strength/power, and tracks/historical remains in the earth/Planet Earth, so God punished/took them because (of) their crimes, and (there) was not for them from a protector/preserver from God.
That (is) because they (E), their messengers were coming to them with the evidences, so they disbelieved, so God punished/took them , that He truly is strong, strong (severe in) the punishment.
And We had (E) sent Moses with Our verses/evidences/signs, and a clear/evident proof/power .
To Pharaoh, and Haman , and Qaroon/Korah , so they said: "A liar/falsifier , magician/sorcerer."
So when He came to them with the truth from at Us, they said: "Kill/fight (the) sons of those who believed with him, and shame/keep alive their women, and the disbelievers' plot/conspiracy (is) not except in misguidance."
And Pharaoh said: "Leave me (to) kill Moses, and he should call his Lord, that I, I fear that (E) he exchanges/replaces your religion, and that (E) he makes the corruption in the earth/Planet Earth apparent/visible."
And Moses said: "That I seeked protection with (from) my Lord, and your Lord, from every arrogant (that) does not believe, with (in) the Account Day/Resurrection Day."
And a man believing from Pharaoh's family, he hides/conceals his faith/belief said: "Do you kill a man that (E) he says, my Lord is God? And he had come to you with the evidences from your Lord, and if he be a liar/falsifier so on him his lies/defiance/falsification, and if he be truthful, some of which he promises you strikes you ,that truly God does not guide who he is (a) waster/extravagator , liar/denier/falsifier."
You my nation, for you (is) the kingdom/ownership the day/today, conquering/defeating in the earth/Planet Earth, so who gives us victory/aid from God's courage/might/power, if (it) came to us? Pharaoh said: "I do not show you/make you understand except what I see/understand, and I do not guide you except the corrects/right guidance's way/path ."
And who believed said: "You my nation, that I, I fear on (for) you, equal/alike to day (of) the groups/parties." 
Equal/alike (to) Noah's, and Aad's, and Thamud's habit/affair, and those from after them, and God does not want injustice/oppression to the worshippers/slaves .
And you my nation, that I, I fear on (for) you the Calling Day/Resurrection Day.
A day/time you turn away giving your backs, no protector/shelterer (is) for you from God, and whom God misguides, so (there is) no guide for him.
And Joseph had come to you from before with the evidences, so you are still continuing in doubt/suspicion from what he came to you with it, until when he perished/died, you said: 'God will never/not send from after him a messenger.' as/like that God misguides whom He is (a) waster/extravagator , doubtful/suspicious.
Those who argue/dispute in God's evidences/verses/signs without a proof/evidence (that) came to them, abhorrence/hatred became big at God, and at those who believed, as/like that God stamps/seals on every/each arrogant tyrant/merciless heart/mind .
And Pharaoh said: "You Haman , build/construct a palace/towering building for me, maybe/perhaps I reach the reasons/motives ."
The skies'/space's reasons/connections so I look/see to Moses' God, and that I think/suppose (E) him (to be) a liar/denier/falsifier. And as/like that (it) was decorated/beautified to Pharaoh, his deed's bad/evil ,and he was prevention/obstruction from the way/path , and Pharaoh's plot/conspiracy is not except in destruction/loss.
And who believed said: "You my nation, follow me, I guide you the correct/right guidance's way/path."
You my nation, truly this the life the present/worldly life (is) enjoyment , and that truly the end (other life) it is the settlement's house/home.
Who made/did a sin/crime so (he) will not be reimbursed except equal/alike to it, and who made/did correct/righteous deeds from a male or a female, and he is believing, so those they enter the Paradise, (they are) being provided for in it, without account/calculation.
And you my nation, why (is it) for me (that) I call you to the salvation/rescue , and you call me (E) to the fire .
You call me (E) to disbelieve with God, and I share/make partners with Him, what is not for me with it knowledge, and I call you to the glorious/mighty , the forgiving often/forgiver.
Undoutably/certainly that what you call me (E) to it, a call/request/prayer is not for him/it in the present world and nor in the end (other life), and that (E) our return (is) to God, and that (E) the wasters/extravagators , they are the fire's friends/company .
So you will remember what I say to you, and I authorize/entrust/empower my matter/affair to God, that truly God (is) seeing/knowing/understanding with the worshippers/slaves .
So God protected/preserved him (from) what they plotted/conspired (in) sins/crimes, and was surrounded/encircled with Pharaoh's family, the torture's bad/evil/harm. 
The fire they are being displayed/exhibited on (to) it, (at) early morning and (at) evening/first darkness , and a day/time the Hour/Resurrection starts Pharaoh's family enter (in) the torture's strongest.
And when they argue/quarrel in the fire , so the weak say to those who became arrogant: "That we, we were for you following, so are you enriching/sufficing from us a share from the fire ?"
Those who became arrogant said: "We (E) all/each (are) in it, that truly God had judged/ruled between the worshippers/slaves ."
And those in the fire said to Hell's safe keepers: "Call your Lord, (to) reduce/lighten from us a day from the torture."
They said: "Were your messengers not being coming to you with the evidences?" They said: "Yes/certainly." They said: "So call, and the disbelievers' call/prayer (is) not except in misguidance."
We (E), We give victory/aid (to) Our messengers and those who believed in the life the present/worldly life, and a day/time the witnesses/testifiers stand/get up .
A day/time, the unjust/oppressive, their apologies/excuses do not benefit (them), and for them (is) the curse/torture, and for them the house's/home's bad/evil/harm.
And We had (E) given Moses the guidance, and We made Israel's sons and daughters inherit The Book .
Guidance and a remembrance/reminder to (owners) of the pure hearts/minds .
So be patient that truly God's promise (is) true , and ask for forgiveness for your crime, and praise/glorify with your Lord's praise/gratitude at the evening/first darkness and the day breaks/early morning.
That truly those who argue/dispute in God's evidences/verses/signs without a proof/evidence/authority (that) came to them, that (E) in the chests (innermosts is) except arrogance/great sin/disbelief and sharing , they are not with reaching it, so seek protection by God, that He truly is the hearing/listening, the seeing/knowing .
Creation (E) (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (is) greater than the people's creation, and but most of the people do not know.
And the blind, and the seeing do not become equal, and those who believed, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and nor the sinner/criminal, little (is) what you mention/remember .
That truly the Hour/Resurrection is coming (E) no doubt/suspicion in it, and but most of the people do not believe.
And your Lord said: "Call Me, I answer/reply to you, that truly those who are being arrogant from worshipping Me they will enter Hell degraded/lowly ."
God (is) who made/created for you the night to be tranquil/settled in it, and the daytime to see (clearly lit) , that truly God (is owner) of grace/favour/blessing on the people, and but most of the people do not thank/be grateful.
That (is) God, your Lord creator (of) every thing, (there is) no God except Him, so how/when (are) you being turned away ? 
As/like that those who were with God's verses/evidences/signs disbelieving and denying are being turned away .
God is who made/created for you, the earth/Planet Earth (as) a settlement , and the sky/space (a) structure , and He pictured/shaped you , so He did good (perfected in) your pictures/shapes/forms, and He provided you from the goodnesses , that (is) God, your Lord, so blessed (is) God the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
He is the live/alive, (there is) no god except Him, so call Him faithful/loyal/devoted to him (in) the religion/faith, the praise/gratitude (is) to God the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
Say: "That I, I was forbidden/prohibited that (E) I worship those whom you worship from other than God when the evidences came to me from my lord, and I was ordered/commanded that (E) I surrender/submit/become Moslem to the creations altogether's/(universes') Lord."
He is who created you from dust/earth, then from a drop/male's or female's secretion , then from a blood clot/sperm/semen , then He brings you out (as) a child/children, then to reach your maturity/strength, then to be (E) old aged , and from you whom (is) made to die from before, and to reach a named/identified (specified) term/time, and maybe/perhaps you reason/comprehend .
He is who revives/makes alive, and makes die, so if He passed judgment (in) a matter/affair/order/ command, so but He says to it: "Be." So it becomes."
Do you not see/understand to those who argue/dispute in God's verses/evidences/signs, where/how (do) they be diverted/misguided ?
Those who lied/denied/falsified with The Book and with what We sent Our messengers with it, so they will know.
When the leather or iron collars or handcuffs (are) in their necks, and (with) the chains they be dragged on the ground .
In the hot/cold water , then in the fire they overflow/burn and refuel .
Then (it) was said to them: "Where (are) what you were sharing/making partners?"
From other than God? They said: "They were misguided from us, but we were not calling from before a thing." As/like that God misguides the disbelievers.
That (is) because (of) what you were being happy/rejoiceful/delighted in the earth/Planet Earth without the right/truth , and because (of) what you were being lively and joyful .
Enter Hell's doors/entrances, immortally/eternally in it, so how bad (is) the arrogant's home/residence/dwelling?
So be patient, that truly God's promise (is) true/truth , so either We show you/make you understand some of which We promise them, or We make you die, so to Us they be returned.
And We had (E) sent messengers from before you, from them whom We relayed/informed on (to) you, and from them whom We did not relay/inform on (to) you; and (it) was not to a messenger that (E) He comes with an evidence/verse/sign except with God's permission , so if God's order/command came, judgment was passed/ordered with the truth , and at that place and time the wasters/falsifiers lost .
God (is) who made/created for you the camels/livestock to ride from it, and from it you eat.
And for you in it (are) benefits/uses, and to reach on it a need/necessity in your chests (innermosts), and on it and on the ship/ships you be carried/loaded .
And He shows/makes you understand His verses/signs/evidences, so which (of) God's verses/signs/evidences (do) you deny ?
Do they not walk/move in the earth/Planet Earth, so they see/wonder about how was those from before them's end/turn (result)? They were more than them, and stronger (in) strength/power and tracks/historical remains in the earth/Planet Earth, so what they were gaining/acquiring did not enrich/suffice from them (in a thing) .
So when their messengers came to them with the evidences, they became happy/rejoiced/delighted with what (is) at them from the knowledge; and what they were with it mocking/making fun surrounded/afflicted with them.
So when they saw/understood Our might/power they said: "We believed with (in) God alone, and we disbelieved with what we were with Him sharing/making partners."
So their belief did not be beneficial (to) them when they saw/understood Our might/power , God's law/manner which had past in His worshippers/slaves , and the disbelievers lost at that place and time.

Descent from the merciful, the most merciful.
A Book its verses were detailed/explained/clarified, an Arabic Koran to a nation reasoning/comprehending/knowing .
An announcer of good news and a warner/giver of notice , so most of them objected/opposed , so they do not hear/listen.
And they said: "Our hearts/minds (are) in covers/protections from what you call us to it, and in our ears (is a) weight/deafness , and from between us and between you (is) a divider/partition , so make/do , that we truly are making/doing ."
Say: "But/truly I am a human equal/alike to you (it) is being transmitted/revealed to me that your Lord (is) one God, so be straight/direct to Him, and ask Him for forgiveness, and calamity/Hell to the sharers/takers of partners (with God) ."
Those who do not give/bring the charity/purification , and they are with the end (other life), they are disbelieving.
That truly those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them (is) a reward/wage not interrupted/weakened (continuous).
Say: "Do you disbelieve (E) with who created the earth/Planet Earth in two days, and you make/put for Him equals (idols), that (is) the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
And He made/put in it anchors/fixtures/mountains from above it, and He blessed in it, and He predestined/evaluated in it its provision in four days, straight/equal to the askers/questioners .
Then He aimed/tended to the sky/space and it is smoke/fumes, so He said to it and to the earth/Planet Earth: "You (B) come voluntarily or forcefully/involuntarily ." They (B) said: "We came obedient."
So He ordered/accomplished them (as) seven skies/space(s) in two days, and He inspired/transmitted in every/each sky/space its matter/affair/order/command, and We decorated/beautified the present world's sky/space with lights/stars and a protection/ observation , that (is) the glorious'/mighty's , the knowledgeable's predestination/ evaluation .
So if they objected/opposed , so say: "I warned/gave you notice (of) a fire falling from the sky accompanied by thunderous noise/destructive torture equal/alike to Aad and Thamud's fire falling from the sky accompanied by thunderous noise/destructive torture ."
When the messengers came to them from between their hands and from behind them: "That do not worship except God." They said: "If our Lord wanted/willed, He would have descended angels, so we are with what you were sent with it disbelieving."
So but Aad they became arrogant in the earth/Planet Earth without the right/truth , and they said: "Who (is) stronger than us (in) strength/power?" Do they not see/understand that (E) God (is) who created them, He is stronger than them (in) strength/power, and they were with Our evidences/verses/signs disbelieving and deny ing
So We sent on (to) them a severely cold/roaring wind/breeze in unlucky/miserable days/times, to make them taste/experience the shame's/scandal's/disgrace's torture in the life the present/worldly life, and the end's (other life's) torture (E) (is) more shameful/scandalous/disgraceful, and they are not being given victory/aid.
And but Thamud, so We guided them so they loved/liked the blindness/misguidance more, over the guidance, so the torture the humiliating/disgraceful cry of torture/destructive torture punished/took them because of what they were gaining/acquiring .
And We saved/rescued those who believed and were fearing and obeying.
And a day/time God's enemies be gathered to the fire , so they are being restrained/held back .
Until when they came to it! Their hearing/listening , and their eye sights/understanding, and their skins testified/witnessed on them because (of) what they were making/doing .
And they said to their skins: "Why (did) you witness/testify on us?" They said: "God who made every thing speak, made us speak, and He created you (the) first/beginning time , and to Him you are being returned."
And you were not covering/hiding yourselves that (E) your hearing/listening , and nor your eye sights/understanding, and nor your skins witnesses/testifies on (against) you, and but you thought/assumed that (E) God does not know much from what you made/do.
And that (is) your thought/assumption which you thought/assumed with your Lord, He made you fall/ruin so you became from the losers .
So if they be patient so the fire (is a) residence/dwelling for them, and if they offer reconciliation , so they are not from the permitted to offer reconciliation .
And We predestined/assigned for them companions , so they decorated/beautified for them what (is) between their hands, and what (is) behind them, and the saying/words became true/truth on them in nations (that) had passed from before them from the Jinns, and the human/mankind, that they truly were losers .
And those who disbelieved said: "Do not hear/listen to that the Koran , and cancel/abolish/nullify in it, maybe/perhaps you defeat/conquer ."
So We will make those who disbelieved taste/experience (E) a strong (severe) torture, and We will reimburse them (the) worst deeds (of) what they were making/doing .
That (is) God's enemies' reimbursement , the fire, for them in it (is) the immortality's/eternity's house/home (permanent residence), reimbursement because (of) what they were with Our verses/evidences/signs disbelieving and denying
And those who disbelieved said: "Our Lord, show us those (B) who misguided us from the Jinns and the human/mankind, we make/put them (B) below/under our feet, to be (B) from the lowest/meanest." 
That truly those who said: "Our Lord (is) God." Then they became straight/direct, the angels descend on them (and say): "That you do not fear and nor be saddened/grieved, and be announced good news to with (about) the Paradise which you were being promised."
We are your guardians/allies in the life the present/worldly life and in the end (other life), and for you in it what yourselves desire/crave , and for you in it what you call/wish/desire.
Descent from a forgiver, merciful.
And who (is) better (in) a word/opinion and belief than who called to God and made/did correct/righteous deeds, and he said: "That I am (E) from the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers."
And the good/goodness does not become equal/alike and nor the sin/crime, pay/push/repel with which it is best , so then who (is) between you and between him animosity as though/as if he (is a) concerned guardian/ally .
And none receives/finds it except those who were patient, and none receives/finds it except (owners) of great luck/fortune.
And if from the devil an urge to spoil/do evil urges you to spoil/do evil (E), so seek protection by God, that He truly, He is the hearing/listening , the knowledgeable.
And from His verses/evidences/signs (are) the night and the daytime and the sun and the moon, do not prostrate to the sun and nor to the moon, and prostrate to God who created them (B), if you were/are (only) Him worshipping.
So if they became arrogant, so those who (are) at your Lord they praise/glorify to Him by the night and the daytime, and they do not get bored/tired.
And from His verses/evidences/signs, that you see the earth/Planet Earth humble/submissive , so if/when We descended on it the water, it shook/moved and it grew/increased, that truly who revived it (is) reviving (E) the deads, that He truly (is) on every thing capable/able.
That truly those who deviate, insult and defame God in Our verses/evidences/signs, they are not hidden on (from) Us. Is who is being thrown in the fire better or who comes safe/secure (on) the Resurrection Day? Make/do what you willed/wanted, that He truly is with what you make/do seeing/knowing .
That truly those who disbelieved with the reminder/remembrance when (it) came to them, and that it truly is a glorious/mighty Book (E) .
The falsehood does not come to it from between its hand and nor from behind it, descent from (the) wise/judicious, praiseworthy/commendable.
(It) is not said to you except what had been said to the messengers from before you, that truly your Lord (is owner) of (E) a forgiveness and (owner) of a painful punishment.
And if We made it a non-Arabic/Persian Koran , they would have said: "If only its verses were detailed/explained . Is (it) a non-Arabic/Persian (Koran) and an Arab (messenger)?" Say: "It is to those who believed guidance and a cure/recovery/healing; and those who do not believe, in their ears (is a) weight/heaviness and it is on them blindness/confusion , those, they are being called, from a far/distant place/position ." 
And We had given/brought Moses The Book , so it was disputed in it, and where it not for a word (that) proceeded from your Lord, (it) would have been executed between them, and that they truly are in doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from it.
Who made/did correct/righteous deeds, so for himself, and who did bad/evil/harm so on (for) it, and your Lord (is) not with an unjust/oppressor to the worshippers.
To Him the Hour's/Resurrection's knowledge be returned, and none emerges from fruits from its buds/covers from which they emerge, and none from a female conceives/(is) pregnant with/carries , and nor gives birth/drops except with His knowledge, and a day/time He calls them: "Where (are) my p artners?" They said: "We took your leave, we informed you , none from an honest witness/testifier is from us."
And what they were calling from before misguided/lost from them, and they thought/assumed nothing from (an) escape/diversion (is) for them (there is no escape for them).
The human/mankind does not get bored/tired from the goodness' call/request/prayer , and if the bad/evil/harm touched him, so he is despairing/hopeless despaired.
And if (E) We made him taste/experience mercy from Us, from after calamity/disastrous distress touched him, he will say (E): "That (is) for me, and I do not think/assume the Hour/Resurrection (is) starting , and if (E) I was returned to my Lord, that truly for me at Him (is) the best/most beautiful/goodness (E)." So We will inform those who disbelieved with what they made/did , and We will make them taste/experience (E) from a strong/rough torture.
And if We blessed/comforted and eased on the human/mankind he objected/opposed and he went far with his side/direction, and if the bad/evil/harm touched him, so (he is owner) of (a) wide/broad call/request/prayer .
Say: "Did you see/understand if (it) was from at God, then you disbelieved with (in) it, who (is) more misguided than who he is in far/distant defiance/animosity ."
We will show them/make them understand Our verses/signs/evidences in the horizons/directions and in their selves, until (it) becomes clear/explained for them that it (is) the truth . Is (it) not enough/sufficient with your Lord, that He truly is on every thing witnessing/testifying?
Is (it) not that they truly are in doubt from meeting their Lord? Is (it) not that He truly is with every thing surrounding/encircling? 
H M .
En S/K
As/like that God inspires/transmits to you, and to those from before you, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
For Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the high and mighty/dignified, the great.
The skies/space are about to/almost split/crack/cleave from above them, and the angels praise/glorify with their Lord's praise/gratitude/thanks, and they ask for forgiveness to whom (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, is (it) not that truly God, He is the forgiving, the merciful?
And those who took from other than Him guardians/allies , God (is an) observer on them, and you are not on them with a guardian/protector .
And as/like that We inspired/transmitted to you an Arabic Koran to warn/give notice to the mother/origin (of) the villages/urban cities and who (is) around/surrounding it, and warn/give notice (of) the Gathering Day/Resurrection Day, (there is) no doubt/suspicion in it, a group/party/flock (are) in the Paradise, and a group/party/flock (are) in the blazing/inflamed (inferno).
And if God wanted/willed He would have made them one nation, and but He enters in His mercy whom He wills/wants, and the unjust/oppressive (there is) none for them from a guardian/ally and nor (a) victorior/savior .
Or they took from other than Him guardians/allies , so God, He is the guardian/ally , and He revives/makes alive the deads, and He is on every thing capable/able.
And what you differed/disagreed/disputed in it from a thing, so its judgment/rule (is) to God, that one (is) God, my Lord, on Him I relied/depended , and to Him I return/repent/obey .
Creator/bringer to being (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, He made/created for you from yourselves spouses/pairs/kinds , and from the camels/livestock spouses/pairs/kinds , He creates/seeds you in it, (there) is not like Him/similar to Him a thing, and He is the hearing/listening, the seeing .
For Him (are) the skies'/space's keys/safes (management and control), He spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants, and He is capable/able , that He truly (is) with every thing knowledgeable.
He explained/showed for you from the religion what He directed/commanded with it Noah, and what We inspired/transmitted to you, and what We directed/commanded with it Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, that (E) keep up/call for the religion, and do not separate in it, (it) became big/a burden on the sharers/takers of partners with God, what you call them to it, God chooses/purifies to Him whom He wills/wants, and He guides to Him who returns/repents/obeys .
And they did not separate except from after the knowledge came to them, oppression/transgression between them, and where it not (for) a word/expression preceded from your Lord to a named/identified (specified) term/time, (it) would have been executed/ended (E) between them, and that truly those who were made to inherit The Book from after them (are) in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from it.
So to/for that so call, and be straight/direct, as/like you were ordered/commanded, and do not follow their self attractions for desires , and say: "I believed with what God descended from a Book , and I was ordered/commanded to be just/equitable between you, God (is) our Lord and your Lord, for us (are) our deeds, and for you (are) your deeds, no argument between us and between you, God gathers/collects between us, and to Him (is) the end/destination."
And those who argue/dispute/quarrel in (about) God from after what was answered/replied to Him, their argument (is) annulled at their Lord, and on them (is) anger, and for them (is) a painful torture.
God (is) who descended The Book with the truth , and the scale/measuring instrument , and what makes you know/informs you, maybe/perhaps the Hour/Resurrection (is) near/close.
Those who do not believe with (in) it hasten/urge with it, and those who believed (are) afraid/cautious from it, and they know that it (E) (is) the truth , is (it) not that truly those who argue/discuss in the Hour/Resurrection (are) in (E) far/distant misguidance?
God (is) kind/courteous/soothing with His worshippers/slaves , He provides for whom He wills/wants, and He is the powerful/strong, the glorious/mig hty .
Who was wanting/intending the end's (other life's) cultivation/plantation (enjoyment), We increase for him his cultivation/plantation (enjoyment), and who was wanting/intending the present world's cultivation/plantation (enjoyment), We give/bring him from it, and (there is) no share/ luck/fortune for him in the end (other life).
Or for them (are) partners (with God who) explained/showed to them from the religion what God did not permit/allow with it? Where it not for the judgment's/decision's word/expression , (it) would have been judged/executed between them, and that truly the unjust/oppressive, for them (is) a painful torture.
You see the unjust/oppressive afraid/cautions from what they gathered/acquired , and it is falling/landing with (on) them, and those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds (are) in the Paradise's gardens/meadows , for them what they want at their Lord, that it is the grace/favour/blessing, the great.
That (is) what God announced good news (to) His worshippers/slaves , those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, say: "I do not ask/question/demand you on (for) it a reward/wage except the love/affection in the relations/near." And who perpetrates/does a good/goodness, We increase goodness/beauty for him in it, that truly God (is) forgiving, thanked/thankful/grateful.
Or they say: "He fabricated on (about) God lies/falsifications ." So if God wants, He seals/stamps on your heart/mind , and God eliminates/erases the falsehood, and God corrects/makes true the truth with His words/expressions, that He truly is knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts). 
And He is who accepts/receives the repentance from His worshippers/slaves , and He forgives/pardons of the sins/crimes, and He knows what you make/do .
And He answers/replies to those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and He increases them from His grace/favour/blessing; and the disbelievers, for them (is) a strong (severe) torture.
And if God spread/extended the provision to His worshippers/slaves, they would have oppressed/transgressed in the earth/Planet Earth, and but He descends with a measure/predestiny what He wills/wants, that He truly is with His worshippers/slaves expert/experienced, seeing/knowing .
And He is who descends the rain from after what they despaired, and He spreads/extends His mercy, and He is the guardian/ally , the praiseworthy/commendable.
And from His verses/evidences/signs (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's creation, and what He scattered/distributed in them (B) from a walker/creeper/crawler , and He is on gathering/collecting them if He wills/wants capable/able.
What struck/hit you from a disaster so (it is) because (of) what your hands gathered/acquired ,and He forgives/pardons on much.
And you are not with disabling/frustrating in the earth/Planet Earth, and (there is) nothing for you from other than God from a guardian/ally, and nor (a) victorior/savior .
And from His signs/evidences (are) the ships in the sea/ocean like the signs/banners .
If He wills/wants He stops/quietens the wind/breeze, so they continue/remain still/fixed in place on its back/surface , that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to every/each patient/endurer, thankful/grateful.
Or He destroys/perishes them because (of) what they gathered/acquired , and He forgives/pardons on much .
And those who argue/dispute in Our verses/evidences know (there is) none from (an) escape/diversion for them.
So what you were given from a thing so (it is) long life/enjoyment (of) the life the present/worldly life, and what (is) at God (is) better and more lasting (everlasting) to those who believed and on their Lord, they rely/depend .
And those who avoid/distance themselves (from) the great/magnified sins'/crimes' biggest/greatest , and the enormous/atrocious deeds , and when they became angry, they forgive.
And those who answered/replied to their Lord and they kept up the prayers, and their matter/affair (is by) consultation/advice between them, and from what We provided for them, they spend.
And those who when/if the oppression/transgression struck/marked them , they become victorious.
And a sin's/crime's reimbursement (is) a sin/crime equal to it , so who forgave/pardoned and corrected/repaired , so his reward (is) on God, that He truly does not love/like the unjust/oppressors.
And who (E) became victorious after injustice/oppression to him, so those no way/path (blame) is on them.
But the way/path (blame is) on those who cause injustice/oppression (to) the people, and they oppress/transgress in the earth/Planet Earth without the right/truth , those for them (is) a painful torture. 
And who (E) became patient and forgave, that truly that (is) from the matter's/affair's decisiveness/determination .
And whom God misguided, so (there is) none from a guardian/ally for him from after Him, and you see the unjust/oppressors when they saw the torture, they say: "Is (there) from a way/path to return?"
And you see them they are being displayed/exhibited on it, humble/submissive from the humiliation/disgrace , they look/watch from a hidden end/edge/eyelid , and those who believed said: "That truly the losers (are) those who lost themselves and their families/relations (on) the Resurrection Day; are not the unjust/oppressors in a continuous torture?
And (there) were none from guardians/allies from other than God for them, they give them victory/aid from other than God, and whom God misguides, so (there is) no way/path for him (no escape for him).
Answer/reply to your Lord from before that (E) a day/time comes (there be) no return (protection) to (from) it from God, none from a refuge/shelter (is) for you (on) that day, and none from defiance/ignorance (is) for you.
So if they objected/opposed , so We did not send you on (to) them (as) a protector/guard , that truly on you (is nothing) except the information/communication, and We (E) if We made the human/mankind taste/experience mercy from Us, he became happy/rejoiced with it, and if a sin/crime strikes/marks them with because (of) what their hands advanced , so then the human/mankind (is an insistent) disbeliever.
To God (is) the sky's/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/kingdom, He creates what He wills/wants, He grants/presents to whom He wills/wants females, and He grants/presents to whom He wills/wants the males.
Or He gets them married/couples males and females, and He makes/creates whom He wills/wants infertile, that He truly is knowledgeable, capable/able.
And (it) was not to a human that (E) God converses/speaks to him , except (by) inspiration/transmission or from behind (a) divider/partition , or He sends a messenger so he (the messenger) inspires/transmits what He wills/wants with His permission , that He truly is high/elevated, wise/judicious.
And like that We inspired/transmitted to you, a Soul/Spirit , from Our order/command/matter/affair, you were not knowing what (is) The Book , and nor the faith/belief, and but We made it a light, We guide with it whom We will/want from Our worshippers/slaves , and that you guide (E) to a straight/direct road/way.
God's road/way, who for Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, is (it) not to God the order's/command's/matter's/affair's end/destiny? 
H M .
And The Book , the clear/evident.
We (E) made it an Arabic Koran , maybe/perhaps you reason/comprehend.
And that it truly is in The Books' mother/origin at Us (The Book's origin is at Us), height and mighty (E) ,wise/judicious (full of wisdom).
Do We disregard/move from you the reminder/remembrance forgiveness/ condonation ? That (E) you were a nation (of) spoilers/neglecters .
And how many We sent from a prophet in the first/beginners.
And a prophet does not come to them except they were with him mocking/making fun.
So We destroyed , (those who were) stronger than them violent destruction/attack, and the first's/beginner's proverb/example passed/expired
And if (E) you asked/questioned them: "Who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth?" They will say (E): "The glorious/mighty , the knowledgeable created them (B)."
Who made/created for you the earth/Planet Earth spread/prepared , and He made/put for you in it roads/means , maybe/perhaps you be guided.
And who descended from the sky/space water with a measure/predestiny , so We revived/resurrected with it a dead/lifeless land , as/like that you are being brought out .
And who created the pairs/kinds all of them, and He created for you from the ship/ships and the camels/livestock what you ride/board .
To sit on on its backs/surfaces , then you remember/mention your Lord's blessing/goodness when you sat on it, and you say: "Praise/glory (to) who humiliated/subjugated for us this, and we were not to it overpowering/connecting (without God) ."
And that We are to our Lord returning (E) .
And they made/put for Him from His worshippers/slaves a part/portion (partner), that truly the human/mankind (is a) a clear/evident (insisting) disbeliever (E).
Or He took/received from what He creates daughters, and he chose (specialized) you with sons.
And if any of them was announced good news to with what He gave to the merciful (as) an example (the daughters), his face became/continued blackened, and he is holding (his) breath/suppressed .
Is who (is) being brought up/originated in the ornament/decoration (luxuriated i.e.: girls and those effeminate and unmanly) and he is in the dispute/controversy/argument not evident/shown ?
And they made the angels those who they are the merciful's worshippers/slaves (as) females, did they witness their creation? Their testimony/certification will be written , and they (will) be asked/questioned.
And they said: "If the merciful willed/wanted we would not have worshipped them, none from knowledge with that (is) for them, that truly they are except lying/speculating.
Or We gave them a Book from before it, so they are with it holding/seizing/ grasping ?
But they said: "We (E), we found our fathers on a constitution (set example) , and We (E) on their tracks are guided."
And as/like that We did not send from before you in a village/urban city from a warner/giver of notice except its luxuriated ungrateful and arrogant said: "We (E), we found our fathers on a constitution (set example) , and we (E), on their tracks , we are following/imitating (their) example."
He (the messenger) said : "Even if I came to you with more guiding than what you found on it your fathers?" They said: "We (E) (are) with what you were sent with it (are) disbelievers."
So We revenged from them, so see/wonder about how was the liars'/deniers' end/turn (result).
And when Abraham said to his father and his nation: "That I am innocent from what you worship."
Except who created me/brought me into being , so that He truly will guide me.
And he made it a word/expression , remaining/lasting in his sons/descendants , maybe/perhaps they return.
But I gave those a long life/made those enjoy, and their fathers, until the truth and a clear/evident messenger came to them.
And when the truth came to them, they said: "That (is) magic/sorcery, and we are with it disbelieving."
And they said: "If only this the Koran was descended on a great man from the two villages/urban cities."
Are they apportioning/dividing/making fate (of) your Lord's mercy, We (E) apportioned/divided/fated between them their livelihood in the life the present/worldly life, and We raised some of them over/above some steps/stages/degrees, for some to take some of them making fun/ridiculing , and your Lord's mercy (is) better than what they gather/collect .
Were it not for that the people be one nation We would have made to who disbelieves with the merciful, for their houses/homes roofs/ceilings from silver and stairs/lifts on it they mount/ascend.
And for their houses doors/entrances and beds/sofas, on it they lean/recline on .
And ornament/decoration , and that (E) all (of) that (is) accumulatively/collectively the life the present's/worldly life's long life/enjoyment, and the end (other life) at your Lord (is) to the fearing and obeying.
And who ignores about the merciful's reminder, We predestine/lead/assign for him a devil, so he is for him a companion/friend .
And that they truly, they prevent/obstruct them (E) from the way/path , and they think/suppose that they are guided.
Until if he came to Us, he said: "Oh if only between me and between you (are) the two sun rises'/easts' far distances, so how bad (is) the companion ?"
(It) will never/not benefit you today/the day if you caused injustice/oppressed, that you are in the torture sharing. 
So do you make the deaf hear/listen, or guide the blind/confused , and who was in a clear/evident misguidance?
So when We go away with you (We make you die), so We are from them revenging/punishing.
Or We show you/make you understand what We promised them, so We are on them, We are capable/over powering .
So hold fast/grasp with what was inspired/transmitted to you, that you are on a straight/direct road/way.
And that it truly is a remembrance/reminder to you and to your nation, and you will/shall be asked/questioned.
And ask/question whom We sent from before you from Our messengers, did We make/create from other than the merciful gods (that) they are being worshipped?
And We had sent Moses with Our signs/evidences to Pharaoh and his nobles/group/assembly, so he (Moses) said: "That I am messenger (of) the creations all together's/ (universes') Lord."
So when he came to them with Our evidences/signs , then they are from it laughing.
And We do not show them/make them understand from a verse/evidence/sign except (that) it is greater than its sister, and We took/punished them with the torture, maybe/perhaps they return.
And they said: "You, you the magician/sorcerer, call for us your Lord with what He promised at you, that we truly are guided (E)."
So when We removed/uncovered from them the torture, then they are breaking/breaching/violating.
And Pharaoh called in his nation, he said: "You my nation, is not for me ownership/kingdom (of) Egypt/(the) region , and these the rivers flow/run from beneath/below me, so do you not see/ understand?"
Or I am better than that which He is (Moses) humiliated and nor, is (he) about to clarify/show/explain.
So if only bracelets from gold were thrown on him, or the angels came with him accompanying/joining.
So he misled/fooled his nation, so they obeyed him, that they truly were a nation (of) debauchers/dissoluters .
So when they made Us angry/sad , We revenged from/punished them, so We drowned/sunk them all/all together.
So We made them an advance/past (precedent), and an example/proverb to the ends/lasts/others.
And when Mary's son was given (as) an example , then your nation from Him, they object/obstruct.
And they said: "Are our gods better or He?" They did not give it (the question) to you except arguing/disputing (E), but they are a nation disputing/controverting .
That truly he (Jesus) is except a worshipper/slave We blessed on him and We made him an example to Israel's sons and daughters.
And if We will/want, We would have made from you angels in the earth/Planet Earth they succeed/follow.
And that he/it truly is knowledge (E) to the Resurrection/Time of Resurrection/Hour, so do not doubt/argue (E) with it, and follow Me, that (is a) straight/direct road/way.
And (let) not the devil prevent/obstruct you, that he truly is for you a clear/evident enemy. 
And when Jesus came with the evidences, he said: "I had come to you with the wisdom, and to clarify/explain for you some/part (of) what you differ/disagree in it, so fear and obey God, and obey me."
That truly God He is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him, that (is) a straight/direct way/road.
So the group/parties differed/disagreed from between them, so calamity/scandal to those who caused injustice/oppression from a day's/time's painful torture.
Do they look/watch/wonder about except that the Hour/Resurrection comes to them suddenly/unexpectedly and they do not feel/know/sense?
That day, the faithful close friends some of them to some (to each other are) an enemy, except the fearing and obeying.
You My worshippers , (there is) no fear/fright on you the day/today, and nor you be sad/grieving.
Those who believed with Our verses/evidences and they were Moslems/submitters/surrenders.
Enter the Paradise you and your spouses , you rejoice/delight.
Being circled/walked around on them with platters/plates/bowls from gold and cups , and in it what the selves lust/desire/crave it, and delights/pleasures the eyes/sights, and you are in it immortally/eternally.
And that (is) the Paradise which you were made to inherit it, because (of) what you were making/doing .
For you in it many/much fruits, from it you eat.
That truly the criminals/sinners (are) in Hell's torture immortally/eternally .
(It is) not to be weakened/subsided on them, and they are in it confused/dumbfounded.
And We did not cause injustice/oppression to them, and but they, they were the unjust/oppressive.
And they called: "You Malek , (let) your Lord to end/destroy on us." He said: "That you are waiting/remaining (in it)."
We had (E) come to you with the truth , and but most of you to the truth (are) hating.
Or they conspired and determined a matter/affair , so We are conspiring and determining .
Or they think/suppose that We do not hear/listen (to) their secret and their confidential talk , yes/certainly, and Our messengers (are) at/by them writing/dictating .
Say: "If (there) was to the merciful a child (son), so I am the worshippers' first/beginner ."
Praise/glory (to) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's Lord, the throne's Lord, from/about what they describe/categorize.
So leave them plunge into/engage in conversation (their wishful interpretation of the scriptures) and play/amuse , until they meet/find their day/time which they are being promised.
And He is who (is) in the skies/space a God, and in the earth/Planet Earth a God, and He is the wise/judicious, the knowledgeable.
And blessed who for Him (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's and what (is) between them (B)'s ownership/kingdom , and at Him (is) the Hour's/Resurrection's knowledge, and to Him you are being returned. 
And those whom they call from other than Him, do not own/possess the mediation, except who testified/witnessed with the truth and they are knowing.
And if (E) you asked/questioned them: "Who created them?" They will say (E): "God." So where/how they be lied to/turned away?
And his saying/word: "You my lord, that truly those (are) a nation not believing."
So turn away/disregard from them, and say: "A greeting/safety/security/peace." So they will know. 
H M .
And The Book , the clear/evident .
That We, We descended it in a blessed night, that We, We were warners/givers of notice.
In it every/each wise/judicious matter/affair is separated.
A matter/affair/order/command from at Us, that We were senders/sending.
Mercy from your Lord that He truly is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable.
The skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's Lord and what (is) between them (B), if you were sure/certain.
(There is) no God except Him, He revives/makes alive, and He makes die, your Lord and your fathers'/forefathers', the first's/beginners' Lord.
But they are in doubt/suspicion playing/amusing .
So observe/lie in wait, a day/time the sky/space comes with clear/evident smoke/fumes.
It covers/afflicts the people, that is a painful torture.
(They say): "Our Lord remove/uncover (relieve) from us the torture, that we are believing."
From where/how the remembrance/reminder be for them, and a clear/evident messenger had come to them?
Then they turned away from Him and they said: "Taught/instructed/informed, mad/insane."
That We (are) removing/uncovering (relieving) the torture little, that you truly are returning.
A day/time We violently destroy the violent attack , the greatest/biggest , that We truly are revenging/punishing.
And We had tested/allured Pharaoh's nation before them, and an honoured/generous messenger came to them.
That (E) discharge/fulfill (give/pay) to me God's worshippers/slaves , that I am for you a faithful/loyal messenger.
And that (E) do not become high, mighty and dignified on God, that I am coming to you with a clear/evident proof/evidence .
And that I, I seeked protection with my Lord and your Lord, that (E) you stone me.
And if you do not believe to me, so separate/isolate yourselves from me.
So he called his Lord: "That (E) those (are) a nation (of) criminals/sinners ."
So you go/move with My worshippers/slaves at night, that you are being followed.
And leave the sea/ocean strolling/walking slowly , that they truly are drowning/sinking soldiers/warriors.
How many/much they left (behind) from treed gardens and water springs/wells?
And plants/crops and an honoured/generous position/status ?
And blessing/goodness they were in it joyful (eating fruit) ?
Like that, and We made it be inherited (by) a nation (of) others .
So the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth did not weep (sadden) on them, and they were not given time/delayed .
And We had saved/rescued Israel's sons and daughters from the torture the humiliating/disgracing .
From Pharaoh, that he truly was high and mighty from the wasters/extravagators .
And We had chosen them on knowledge over the creations all together/(universes).
And We gave/brought them from the verses/evidences what is in it a clear/evident test.
That truly those say (E):
That truly it is except our death/lifelessness the first/beginning, and we are not with being revived/resurrected.
So come with our fathers/forefathers if you were truthful.
Are they better or a nation of Tuba (could be from Yemen)/shade and those from before them? We made them die/destroyed them , that they truly were criminals/sinners.
And We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) playing/amusing .
We did not create them (B) except with the truth , and but most of them do not know.
That truly the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day (is) their appointed time all/all together.
A day/time (a) master/ally does not enrich/suffice (replace) from (a) master/ally a thing, and nor they be given victory/aid.
Except whom God had mercy upon (him), that He truly, He is the glorious/mighty , the merciful .
That truly the deadly food's tree.
(Is) the sinner's/criminal's food/feeding.
As/like the dead's pus/melted metals , (it) boils in the bellies/insides.
As the hot water's/red hot coal's boiling.
Take/punish him so pull or drag him violently to the Hell's middle .
Then pour from above his head the hot water's/red hot coal's torture.
Taste/experience, that you are, you are the glorious/mighty , the honored/generous .
That truly that (is) what you were with it doubting/arguing.
That truly the fearing and obeying (are) in a secure/safe position/status .
In treed gardens/paradises and water springs/wells.
They dress from sarcenet (a certain type of silk or brocade), and brocade (silk and gold fabric), facing each other.
As/like that, and We got them married with (spouses of) eyes with intense blackness of pupils and whiteness (beautifully contrasted).
They call in it with all fruits safe/secure .
They do not taste/experience in it the death/lifelessness except the first death, and He protected them (from) the Hell's torture.
Grace/favour from you Lord, that (is) the success/triumph , the great. 
So We eased it/We made it flexible with your tongue/language, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember .
So observe/lie in wait , that they truly are observing/being made to observe  
H M .
The Book's descent from God, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
That truly in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (are) evidences/signs (E) to the believers.
And in your creation, and what He scatters/distributes from a walker/creeper/crawler (are) evidences/signs to a nation being sure/certain.
And (the) difference (of) the night and the daytime, and what God descended from the sky/space from (a) provision , so He revived with it the Earth/land after its death/lifelessness, and diverting/pushing the winds/breezes (are) evidences/signs to a nation reasoning/comprehending .
Those are God's evidences/signs/verses, We read/recite it on (to) you with the truth . With which information/speech after God and His verses/evidences/signs (do) they believe?
Calamity/scandal/grief to every/each liar/falsifier, sinner/criminal .
He hears/listens (to) God's evidences/verses being read/recited on (to) him, then he persists/insists arrogantly as though he did not hear/listen (to) it, so announce good news to him with a painful torture.
And if he knew a thing from Our evidences/verses he took it mockingly/making fun, those for them (is) a humiliating/disgracing torture.
From behind/beyond them (is) Hell , and it does not enrich/suffice from them a thing (from) what they gained/acquired , and nor what they took from other than God (as) guardians/allies , and for them (is) a great torture.
That (is) guidance, and those who disbelieved with their Lord's verses/evidences , for them (is) a torture from painful filth/torture .
God (is) who manipulated/subjugated for you the sea/ocean for the ship/ships (to) flow/run in it with His order/command, and (for) you to wish/desire from His grace/favour , and maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful.
And He manipulated/subjugated for you what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth all/all together from Him, that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation thinking.
Say to those who believed: "Forgive to those who do not hope/expect God's days/times, (it is to Him) to reimburse a nation because (of) what they were gaining/acquiring ."
Who made/did correct/righteous deeds, so (it is) for himself, and who did bad/evil/harm so on (for) it, then to your Lord you are being returned.
And We had (E) given/brought to Israel's sons and daughters The Book , and the judgment/rule, and the prophethood, and We provided for them from the goodnesses , and We preferred/favoured them over the creations all together/(universes).
And We gave/brought them evidences from the matter/affair/order/command, so they did not differ/disagree/dispute except from after what came to them (from) the knowledge, oppression/transgression between them, that truly your Lord passes judgment/ends between them (on) the Resurrection Day in what they were in it differing/disagreeing .
Then We made/put you on God's decreed way of life from the order/command so follow it, and do not follow (the) self attractions for desires (of) those who do not know.
That they truly will never/not enrich/avail (help) from you from God a thing, and that truly the unjust/oppressive some of them (are) guardians/allies (of) some, and God (is) guardian/ally (of) the fearing and obeying.
That (is) mental perceptions/evidences to the people, and guidance, and mercy to a nation being sure/certain.
Or (did) those who earned/committed the sins/crimes think/suppose that (E) We make/put them as those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, equal/alike (in) their life and (in) their death/time of death? It is bad what they judge/rule.
And God created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth , and each/every self (is) to be reimbursed because (of) what it gained/acquired , and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed.
Did you see/understand who took (idolized) his self attraction for desire (as) his god? And God misguided him on knowledge, and He sealed/stamped on his hearing/listening/sense of hearing and His heart/mind ,and He made/put on his eye sight/understanding a cover, so who guides him from after God? So do you not mention/remember ?
And they said: "It is not except our life the present/worldly life, we die and we live, and nothing makes us die/destroys us except the long time." And (there is) no knowledge with that for them, that truly they are except assuming/supposing .
And if Our evidences/signs/verses are read/recited on (to) them, their argument was not except that (E) they said: "Come/bring with our fathers/forefathers if you were truthful."
Say: "God revives/makes you alive, then He makes you die, then He gathers/collects you to the Resurrection Day, no doubt/suspicion in it, and but most of the people do not know."
And to God (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/possession , and a day/time the Hour/Resurrection starts , that day, the wasters/annulers loose .
And you see every/each nation kneeling/sitting on (its) knees , every/each nation is being called to its Book , (and told): "The day/today you are being reimbursed (for) what you were making/doing ."
That (is) Our Book (it) speaks/clarifies on (to) you with the truth , that We, We were transcribing/duplicating/printing what you were making/doing .
So but those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so their Lord enters them in His mercy, that it is the winning/success , the clear/evident .
And but those who disbelieved (were told): "Were not My evidences/verses being read/recited on (to) you, so you became arrogant, and you were a nation (of) criminals/sinners?" 
And if (it) was said: "That truly God's promise (is) truth , and the Hour/Resurrection (there is) no doubt/suspicion in it." You said: "We do not know what (is) the Hour/Resurrection , that we assume/suppose except thought/assumption , and we (are) not with being sure/certain."
And it appeared to them sins/crimes (of) what they made/did , and what they were with it mocking/making fun (of) surrounded/encircled with them.
And (it) was said: "The day/today We forget you, as/like you forgot meeting this, your day/time, and your shelter/refuge (is) the fire , and (there are) no victoriors/saviors for you."
That (is) with that you, you took/received God's verses/evidences mockingly/making fun, and the life the present/worldly life has deceived/tempted you. So the day/today they are not brought/driven out from it, and nor they be allowed to offer reconciliation .
So to God (is) the praise/gratitude/thanks, the skies'/space's Lord and the earth's/Planet Earth's Lord, the creations all together's/(universe's) Lord.
And for Him (is) the arrogance/greatness in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious. 
H M .
The Book's descent from God, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious .
We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) except with the truth , and a named/identified (specified) term/time, and those who disbelieved (are) objecting/opposing from what they were warned/given notice (of).
Say: "Did you see what you call from other than God? Show me what they created from the earth/Planet Earth, or for them (is) a partnership in the skies/space? Come/bring to me with a Book from before this, or a mark/historical remain from knowledge, if you were truthful."
And who (is) more misguided than who calls from other than God whom does not answer/reply to him to the Resurrection Day, and they are from their call/request/prayer ignoring/disregarding ?
And if the people were gathered, they (their gods) were enemies for them, and they were with their worshipping disbelieving (disowning).
And if Our evidences/signs/verses are read/recited on them, those who disbelieved to the truth when it came to them said: "This (is) clear/evident magic/sorcery."
Or they say: "He fabricated/cut and split it." Say: "If I fabricated/cut and split it, so you do not own/possess for me from God a thing. He is more knowledgeable with what you rush/hurry in it, enough/sufficient with Him (as) a witness/testifier between me and between you, and He is the forgiving, the merciful."
Say: "I was not (a) new invention/unprecedented from the messengers, and I do not know what will be made/done with me, nor with you, that I follow except what is being inspired/transmitted to me, and I am not except a clear/evident warner/giver of notice."
Say: "Did you see if (it) was from at God, and you disbelieved with (in) it, and a witness/testifier from Israel's sons and daughters witnessed/testified on similar/alike to it (Old Testament), so he believed and you became arrogant? That truly God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive."
And those who disbelieved said to those who believed: "If (it) was good , they would not have preceded us to it." And if they not be guided with it, so they will say: "That (is) old lies/falsehood."
And from before it (is) Moses' Book , a leader/example , and mercy, and that (is a) confirming Book (in an) Arabic tongue/speech, to warn/give notice (to) those who caused injustice/ oppression, and good news to the good doers.
That truly those who said: "Our Lord (is) God" then they became straight/direct, so no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving.
Those are the Paradise's friends/company (they are) immortally/eternally in it, a reward/reimbursement because (of) what they were making/doing .
And We directed/commanded the human (with) a goodness (in treatment) with (to) his parents, his mother bore/became pregnant with him compellingly/forcefully/involuntarily and she gave birth to him compellingly/forcefully/involuntarily, and his weight/pregnancy with him , and his wearing/separation thirty months, until when he reached his maturity/strength, and he reached forty years, he said: "My Lord inspire/influence me that (E) I thank/be grateful (for) your blessing which you blessed on me and on my parents, and that (E) I make/do correct/righteous deeds you accept/approve it, and correct/repair for me in my descendants, that I repented to you, and that I am from the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers."
Those are those whom We accept (the) best (of) what they made/did , and We overlook/forgive from their sins/crimes in the Paradises' friends/company , the truth's promise which they were being promised.
And who said to his parents: "Ugh to you (B) do you (B) promise me that (E) I will be brought out, and the generations/centuries had past/expired from before me?" And they (B), they (B) seek/ask for help (from) God: "Your calamity/scandal/woe believe, that truly God's promise (is) truth ." So he says: "That (is) not except the first's/beginner's myths/baseless stories ."
Those are those who the word/opinion and belief became correct/true in nations (that) had passed/expired from before them from the Jinns and the human/mankind, that they truly were losers .
And to each, steps/degrees from what they made/did , and to fulfill/complete (to) them their deeds, and they not be caused injustice to/oppressed.
And a day/time those who disbelieved be displayed/exhibited on (to) the fire : "You wiped off/eliminated your good (deeds) in your life the present/worldly life, and you lived long/enjoyed with it, so the day/today you are being reimbursed (the) torture (of) the humiliation/disgrace because (of) what you were being arrogant in the earth/Planet Earth without the right , and because (of) what you were debauching ."
And remember Aad's brother when He warned/gave notice (to) his nation by the long winding sand (patterns/dunes), and the warnings/notices had past/expired from between his hands and from behind him (the warnings were given before and during his time): "That you not worship except God, that I, I fear on (for) you a great day's/time's torture."
They said: "Did you come to us to turn us away from our gods, so come/bring to us with what you promise us if you were from the truthful."
He said: "But/truly the knowledge (is) at God, and I communicate/inform you what I was sent with it, and but I see you (as) a nation being lowly/ignorant ."
So when they saw/understood it an obstructing cloud approaching/coming (to) their valleys, they said: "That obstructing cloud (is) raining on us." No/rather it is what you hurried/hastened with it, a wind/smell in it (is) a painful torture.
It destroys every thing with its Lord's order/command, so they became/became in the morning not (to) be seen except their residences, as/like that We reimburse the nation, the criminals/sinners. 
And We had (E) highly positioned/strengthened them in what We have not highly positioned/strengthened you in it, and We made/put for them a sense of hearing , and eye sights, and hearts , so their sense of hearing , and nor their eye sights, and nor their hearts did not enrich/suffice from them a thing when they were disbelieving and denying with God's evidences/verses ; and what they were with it mocking/making fun of surrounded/encircled with them.
And We had (E) destroyed what (is) around/surrounding you from the villages/urban cities, and We detailed/elaborated linguistically the evidences/verses , maybe/perhaps they return.
So if only those whom they took (as) an approachment to God, gods from other than God gave them victory/aid (if only their gods that they worship other than God would give them victory), but they misguided from them, and that (is) their lies/falsehood, and what they were fabricating/cutting and splitting.
And when We diverted/returned/pushed to you a group (from  - )/family/tribe from the Jinns, they hear/listen (to) the Koran , so when they attended/came to it, they said: "Listen quietly." So when it ended (the Koran in entirety), they turned away to their nation warning/giving notice/warners/givers of notice.
They said: "You our nation that we heard/listened to a Book (that) was descended from after Moses, confirming to what (is) between his hands, it guides to the truth and to (a) straight/direct road/path ."
You our nation, answer/reply God's caller/requester, and believe with Him, He forgives for you from your crimes and He protects/defends you from a painful torture.
And who does not answer/reply (to) God's caller/requester so (he is) not with disabling/frustrating in the land/planet Earth , and (there) is not from other than Him guardians/allies , those are in clear/evident misguidance.
Did they not see/understand that (E) God (is) who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and (He) did not fail/fatigue with their creation, (is) with capable/able on that He revives/makes alive the deads, yes/certainly, that He truly is on every thing capable/able .
And a day/time those who disbelieved be displayed/exhibited on (to) the fire (and told): "Is this not with the truth ?" They said: "Yes/certainly and by , our Lord." He said: "So taste/experience the torture because (of) what you were disbelieving."
So be patient as/like (owners) of the decisiveness/determination from the messengers became patient, and do not hurry/hasten for them, a day/time they see/understand what they are being promised (it is) as if they did not stay/remain/wait except an hour from daytime, (this is) information/communication, so do (any) except the nation the debauchers be made to die/be destroyed ? 
Those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from God's way/path He misguided their deeds .
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and believed with what was descended on Mohammad, and it is the truth from their Lord, He covered/substituted from them their sins/crimes, and He corrected/repaired their mind/thought/condition .
That (is) with that those who disbelieved followed the falsehood, and that (E) those who believed followed the truth from their Lord, as/like that God gives to the people their examples .
So if you met/found those who disbelieved, so hitting the necks until when you weakened them , so strengthen the rope/tie/chain (confinement), so either/or blessing (releasing war prisoners) after (the war ends), and either ransom/compensation until the battle/war/fight drops its weights/burdens (ends), that and if God wants/wills He would have gotten victory from them, and but to test some of you with some (to test each other), and those who were killed in God's way/path , so He will never/not misguide their deeds .
He will guide them, and He corrects/repairs their mind/thought/condition .
And He enters them (to) the Paradise (which) He made it known to them.
You, you those who believed, if you give God victory/aid, He gives you victory/aid, and He affirms/strengthens your feet.
And those who disbelieved, so destruction/harm (is) for them, and He misguided their deeds.
That (is) with that they hated what God descended, so He wasted/invalidated their deeds.
Do they not walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth so they see/wonder about how was those from before them's end/turn (result)? God destroyed on them and to the disbelievers similar/alike to it.
That (is) with that God (is) those who believed's guardian/ally , and that (E) the disbelievers (have) no guardian/ally for them.
That truly God enters those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds treed gardens the rivers flow/run from beneath it, and those who disbelieved live long/enjoy and eat as/like the camels/livestock eat, and the fire (is a) home/dwelling for them .
And how many from a village/urban city it is stronger (in) strength/power than your village/urban city which brought/drove you out? We destroyed them , so (there is) no victorior/savior for them.
Is who was on an evidence from his Lord as/like (who) his deed's evil/harm was decorated/beautified for him, and they followed their self attractions for desires ?
The Paradise'sexample which the fearing and obeying were promised in it, (is) rivers from water not stagnant , and rivers from milk, its taste did not change, and rivers from wine/all intoxicants, (it is a) delight/pleasure to the drinking , and rivers from purified/strained honey/molasses , and for them in it (are) from all the fruits, and forgiveness from their Lord, as/like who he is immortal/eternal in the fire , and they were made to drink hot/cold water , so it cut off/severed their intestines/guts.
And from them who hears/listens to you until when they got out/emerged (left) from at you, they said to those who were given/brought the knowledge: "What (did) he say previously/from a short while ?"Those are, those who God stamped/sealed on their hearts/minds , and they followed their self attractions for desires.
And those who guided, He increased them guidance, and He gave them their fear and obedience of God.
So do they wait/watch except (for) the Hour/Resurrection that (E) it comes to them suddenly/unexpectedly, so its signs/indications had (E) come, so how (is it) for them if/when their reminder/remembrance came to them?
So know that it is no god except God (there is no God except the one God)? And ask for forgiveness for your crime, and to the believers (M) and the believers (F), and God knows your turning around/over and your residence/dwelling .
And those who believed said: "If only a chapter of the Koran was descended." So if a perfected/confirmed chapter of the Koran was descended and the fighting was mentioned in it, you saw those whom in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease (doubt) looking to you, (the) vision/sight (of) the unconscious on him from the death/lifelessness (the sight of one afraid of death), so (a) warning/threat (so Hell) to them.
Obedience and a generous word/opinion and belief , so if the matter/affair (was) determined/decided , so if they were truthful (to) God (it) would have been better for them.
So did you maybe/perhaps (hope) if you turned away that (E) you corrupt/disorder in the earth/Planet Earth and cut off/sever your relations/wombs/uteruses? (Did you expect to get away with it? )
Those are those who God cursed/humiliated them , so He made them deaf and (He) blinded/confused their eye sights/understanding.
So do they not consider/deliberate the Koran, or on hearts/minds its locks/closures?
That truly those who returned on their backs/ends from after what was clarified for them (from) the guidance, the devil enticed/lured for them, and extended in time for them.
That is with that they said to those who hated what God descended: "We will obey you in some (of) the matter/affair." And God knows their secrets.
So how (is it) if the angels made them die, they strike/hit their faces and their backs/ends?
That (is) with that they followed what angered/dissatisfied God, and they hated His acceptance/satisfaction , so He wasted/invalidated their deeds.
Or did those whom in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease (doubt) think/suppose that (E) God will never/not bring out their hatred/grudge ?
And if We will/want, We would have shown them to you, so you would have known them by their marks/identifications/expressions, and you will know them in the word's/opinion and belief's or grammatical mistakes/intonement , and God knows your deeds. 
And We will test you until We know the struggling/defending for the faith from you, and the patient, and We test/ justify your news/information/knowledge.
That truly those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from God's way/path and they defied/disobeyed the messenger from after what was clarified for them (from) the guidance, they will never/not harm God (in) a thing, and He will invalidate/waste their deeds.
You, you those who believed, obey God and obey the messenger and do not waste/annul your deeds.
That truly those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from God's way/path then they died and (while) they are disbelievers, so God will never/not forgive for them.
So do not weaken/enfeeble and call to the peace and (while) you are the defeating , and God (is) with you, and He will never/not reduce your deeds.
But/truly the life the present/worldly life is playing/amusement and fun/games (attractions), and if you believe and fear and obey, He gives/brings you your rewards , and He does not ask/question you (for) your properties/possessions .
If He demands/asks you for it , so He asks you persistently , (so) you be stingy/miser and He brings out your hatred/grudge .
Here you are those (who) are being called to spend in God's way/path , so from you who is stingy/ miser; and who is stingy/miser so but (he) is stingy/miser on (against) himself, and God (is) the rich, and you are the poor/needy/deprived , and if you turn away He exchanges/replaces a nation other than you, then they do not be similar/alike to you  
We (E) opened/disclosed for you a clear/evident opening/victory.
(It is for) God to forgive for you what was advanced/undertaken from your crime, and what delayed, and to complete His blessings/goodnesses on you, and He guides you a straight/direct road/way.
And God gives you victory/aid, a glorious/mighty victory/aid .
He is who descended the tranquillity/calm in the believers' hearts/minds to increase belief with (over) their belief, and to God (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's soldiers/warriors, and God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
To enter the believers (M) and the believers (F) treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/water-ways run/flow from below/beneath it, immortally/eternally in it, and He covers/substitutes from them their sins/crimes, and that was/is at God a great success/triumph .
And He tortures the hypocrites (M) and the hypocrites (F), and the sharers/takers of partners with God (M) and the sharers/takers of partners with God (F), the thinkers/assumers with (of) God the bad's/evil's thought/assumption , on them (is) the bad's/evil's circle/disaster, and God became angry/angered on them, and He cursed/humiliated them , and He prepared for them Hell , and it was a bad/evil end/destination.
And to God (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's soldiers/warriors, and God was/is glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.
That We sent you (as) a witness/testifier, and (as an) announcer of good news, and a warner/giver of notice .
To believe with (in) God and His messenger, and you support/aid Him , and you dignify/honour/respect Him , and you praise/glorify Him (at) daybreaks/early mornings and evening to sunset .
That truly those who pledge/swear loyalty to you , truly/indeed they pledge/swear loyalty (to) God, God's hand (is) above/over their hands, so who broke/breached , so but He breaks/breached on (to) himself, and who fulfilled/completed with what he promised/pledged on it (to) God, so He will give/bring him a great reward .
The remaining behind from the Arabs will say to you: "Our properties/wealths and our families/relations preoccupied/distracted us , so ask for forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues what (is) not in their hearts/minds , say: "So who owns/possesses for you from God a thing, if He willed/wanted/intended harm with (for) you, or He willed/wanted/intended with (for) you benefit/usefulness? But God was/is with what you make/do an expert/experienced."
But you thought/supposed that the messenger and the believers will never/not return/turn around to their families/relations ever (E), and that was decorated/beautified in your hearts/minds , and you thought/assumed the bad's/evil's thought/assumption, and you were a destroyed/failed nation.
And who did not believe with (in) God, and His messenger, so We, We prepared to the disbelievers (a) blazing/inflaming (inferno).
And to God (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/kingdom , He forgives to whom He wills/wants, and He tortures whom He wills/wants, and God was/is forgiving/blessing.
The remaining behind, will say when/if you set out to (for) winnings/spoils of war to take/receive it: "Leave us, we follow you." They want/intend that (E) they exchange/replace God's speech , say: "You will never/not follow us, as/like that God said from before." So they will say: "But you envy us ."But they were not understanding except little .
Say to the remaining behind from the Arabs, (often mistranslated as nomads or Bedouins although this verse clearly explains that they are a nation of city dwellers): "You will be called to a nation (owners) of (a) strong (severe) might/power , you fight/kill them or they submit/surrender, so if you obey, God gives/brings you a good/beautiful, reward , and if you turn away as/like you turned away from before, He tortures you a painful torture."
Blame/sin is not on the blind, and nor on the lame/limper (is) blame/sin , and nor on the sick/diseased (is) blame/sin , and who obeys God and His messenger, He enters him treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, and who turns away, He tortures him a painful torture.
God had (E) accepted/approved of the believers, when/if they pledge/swear to you under the trees, so He knew what (is) in their hearts/minds , so He descended the tranquillity/calm on them, and He rewarded/compensated them a near/close opening/victory.
And many winnings/spoils of war they take/receive it, and God was/is glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.
God promised you many winnings/spoils of war , you take/receive it, so He hurried/hastened for you this, and He prevented/stopped the peoples' hands from you, and for it to be an evidence/sign to the believers, and He guides you (to) a straight/direct way/path .
And another you did not become capable/overpowering on it, God had taken care of/surrounded with it, and God was/is on each thing capable/able.
And if those who disbelieved fought you , they would have turned away (on) the backs/ends, then they do no find a guardian/ally , and nor a victorior/savior .
God's law/manner which had past/expired from before, and you will never/not find for God's law/manner an exchange/replacement .
And He is who prevented/stopped their hands from you, and your hands from them with inside Mecca from after that He gave you victory/triumph on them, and God was/is with what you make/do seeing/knowing .
They are those who disbelieved and prevented/stopped you from the Mosque the Forbidden/Sacred , and the offering designated/dedicated , that (E) it reaches its place/destination, and where it not for believing men , and believing women you did not know them, that (E) you invade/set foot on them, so strikes you from them harm without knowledge, (it is for) God to enter in His mercy whom He wills/wants, if they separated/dispersed We would have tortured those who disbelieved from them a painful torture. 
When those who disbelieved made/put the heat/intensity , the pre-Islamic paganism's/ignorance's heat/intensity in their hearts/minds , so God descended His tranquillity/calm on His messenger and those who believed, and He obligated/necessitated the fear and obedience's word/expression , and they were more worthy/deserving with it and its people , and God was/is with every thing knowledgeable.
God had (E) confirmed the dream (of) His messenger, you will enter the Mosque the Forbidden/Sacred ,if God willed/wanted/intended, safe/secure, shaving/removing/pulling (hair) (E) (from) your heads, and doing the utmost/shortening, do not fear, so He knew when you did not know, so He made from other than that a near/close opening/victory.
He is who sent His messenger with the guidance and the truths' religion to make it apparent/visible/overcome on/over the religion all of it, and enough/sufficient with God (as) a witness/testifier .
Mohammad (is) God's messenger, and those who with him (are) strong over the disbelievers, merciful between them, you see them bowing, prostrating wishing/desiring grace/favour from God, and an acceptance/approval , their marks/identifications/expressions (are) in their faces/fronts from the prostration's trace/sign , that (is) their example in the Torah, and their example in the Bible/New Testament , as/like a plant/crop, it brought out/emerged its sprout/shoot , so it surrounded and strengthened it, so it hardened/thickened , so it straightened/leveled on its stem, it pleases/marvels the sowers/seeders/planters to anger/enrage with it the disbelievers, God promised those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds from them, forgiveness and a great reward  
You, you those who believed, do not precede/advance between God's hands and His messenger, and fear and obey God, that truly God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable.
You, you those who believed, do not raise your voices above the prophet's voice , and do not publicize/declare (address openly) to him with the declaration/statement as/like publicizing/declaring/loudness some of you to some (to each other), that (E) your deeds waste/invalidate , and you do not know/sense/feel.
That truly those who lower/diminish/humble their voices at God's messenger, those are those whom God tested/examined their hearts/minds to the fear and obedience of God, for them (is a) forgiveness and a great reward .
That truly those who call you from behind the rooms/chambers, most of them do not reason/comprehend .
And if that they were patient until you get out/emerge to them, (it) would have been better for them, and God (is) forgiving, merciful.
You, you those who believed, if a debaucher came to you with news/information, so seek clarification/explanation that (E) you strike/hit a nation with ignorance/foolishness, so you become/become in the morning on what you made/did regretful/remorseful .
And know that (E) in between you (is) God's messenger, if He obeys you in much from the matter/affair ,you would have suffered hardship/exertion , and but God made the faith/belief lovable/likable to you, and He decorated/beautified it in your hearts/minds , and He made the disbelief and the debauchery and the disobedience hated to you, those, those are the correctly/rightly guided.
Grace/favour from God and a goodness , and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
And if two groups from the believers fought each other , so correct/reconciliate between them (B), so if one of them (B) transgressed over the other, so fight which transgresses until it returns to God's order/command, so if it returned so correct/reconciliate between them (B) with the justice/equality, and be just/equitable, that truly God loves/likes the just/equitable.
Truly/indeed the believers (are) brothers/brethren, so correct/reconciliate between your two brothers, and fear and obey God, maybe/perhaps you attain mercy.
You, you those who believed, a nation does not humiliate/redicule/mock , from (a) nation, maybe/perhaps that (E) they be better than them, and nor women from women, maybe/perhaps that (E) they (F) be better than them (F), and do not backbite/defame yourselves, and do not insult each other/give each other with insulting nicknames, with the nicknames/surnames . How bad (is) the debauchery's name, after the belief? And who does not repent, so those are the unjust/oppressive.
You, you those who believed, avoid/distance yourselves from much of the doubt/suspicion , that truly some/part (of) the doubt/suspicion (is a) sin/crime, and do not spy/seek information (about others) and some of youdo not backbite some (each other). Does any of you love/like that (E) he eats his dead/lifeless brother's flesh ? So you hated it, and fear and obey God, that truly God (is) forgiving, merciful.
You, you the people, that We created you from a male and a female, and We made/created you (into) nations/communities and groups/tribes to know each other, that truly (the) most honoured/kind of you at God (is) your most fearing and obeying, that truly God (is) knowledgeable, expert/experienced.
The Arabs (often mistranslated as nomads or Bedouins, refer to 48:16) said: "We believed." Say: "You did not believe, and but say: 'We submitted/became Moslem ' and the faith/belief did not (E) enter in your hearts/minds . And if you obey God and His messenger He does not reduce/diminish you a thing from your deeds , that truly God (is) forgiving, merciful."
Truly/indeed the believers (are) those who believed with (in) God and His messenger, then they did not doubt/be suspicious, and they struggled/did their utmost with their properties/possessions and themselves in God's way/path , those, they are the truthful.
Say: "Do you teach/instruct/inform God with your religion, and God knows what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and God (is) with every thing knowledgeable?"
They brag on (to) you that (E) they submitted/became Moslem , Say: "Do not brag on (to) me (about) your submission/Islam , but God blesses on you that (E) He guided you to the faith/belief if you were truthful."
That truly God knows the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's absent/invisible , and God (is) seeing/understanding , with what you make/do  
K and the Koran , the most glorious/exalted .
But they were wondering/astonished that (E) a warner/giver of notice came to them from them, so the disbelievers said: "That (is an) unusual (strange) thing."
Is (it that) if we died and we were dust/earth? That (is) a far/distant return.
We had known what the Earth/land reduces/decreases from them, and at Us (is) an honest protecting/safekeeping Book .
But they lied/denied/falsified with the truth when (it) came to them, so they are (in a) confusing/disturbing , matter/affair .
Did they not look/wonder about to the sky/space above them, how We built/constructed it and We decorated/beautified it, and (there are) no openings/gaps due to defects for it?
And the earth/Planet Earth We extended/spread it, and We threw in it anchors/mountains , and We sprouted/grew in it from every/each delightful/cheering pair .
Clarification/understanding and a reminder/remembrance, to each/every repentant slave/worshipper .
And We descended from the sky , blessed water, so We sprouted/grew with it treed gardens and the crop's/harvest's seed/grain.
And palm trees high/tall, for it (is) well arranged first fruit of the season .
A provision to the worshippers/slaves , and We revived with it a dead/lifeless country/land , as/like that (is) the exit/getting out (revival).
Noah's nation denied/falsified before them, and the old well's/Riss'/Rass' owners/company, and Thamud .
And Aad , and Pharaoh, and Lot's brothers.
And the thicket's/dense tangled trees' owners/company, and Tubas' nation, each/all denied/falsified the messengers, so (they) deserved My threat.
Have We been failing with the creation the first/beginning? But they are in confusion/ obscurity from a new creation.
And We had (E) created the human/mankind, and we know what his self inspires and talks with it, and We are nearer/closer to him than the jugular vein (which carries deoxygenated blood to the heart).
When/if the two receivers/meeters/finders meet from the right (side) and the left, protecting/guarding .
Nothing emits/vocalizes from a word except at Him (is a) prepared/made ready observer/guard .
And the death's/liflessness's intensity/agony came with the truth that (is) what you were from it deviating/turning aside.
And (it) was blown in the horn/bugle/instrument that (is) Day of the Threat/Resurrection Day.
And every/each self came with it a driver (herder) and (an) honest witness/testifier.
You had (E) been in negligence/disregard from that, so We removed/uncovered (relieved) from you your cover/concealment, so your eye sight today/the day (is) sharp/iron.
And his companion said: "That what (is) at me (is) prepared/made ready."
You (B) throw in Hell each/every stubborn/obstinate (insisting) disbeliever.
Miser/often preventing to the good , (a) transgressor/violator , doubtful/ suspicious.
Who made/put with God another god, so you (B) throw him in the torture, the strong (severe).
His companion said: "Our Lord I did not make him a tyrant/exceed the limit and but he was in (a) far/distant misguidance."
He said: "Do not dispute/controvert at Me, and I had advanced/preceded to you with the threat."
The word/statement/saying does not become exchanged/replaced/substituted at Me, and I am not with an unjust/oppressor to the worshippers/slaves .
A day/time We say to Hell : "Did you fill?" And it says: "Is (there) from an increase?"
And the Paradise was advanced/brought near to the fearing and obeying not far/distant.
That (is) what you are being promised to each/every repentant/returning (to God), honest protector .
Who feared the merciful with the unseen/hidden and came with (a) repentant heart/mind .
Enter it with safety/security/peace, that (is) the immortality's/eternity's day/time.
For them what they will/want in it, and an increase (is) at Us.
And how many We destroyed before them from (a) generation/century they are stronger than them (in) violent destruction/attack, so they searched/investigated in the countries/lands , is (there) from (an) escape/diversion?
That truly in that (is) a remembrance/reminder (E) to who was for him (a) heart/mind , or He threw the hearing/listening , and He is witnessing/testifying.
And We had (E) created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) in six days/times, and exhaustion did not touch Us.
So be patient on what they say, and praise/glorify with your Lord's praise/gratitude/thanks before the sun's ascent/rising , and before the sunset.
And from the night so praise/glorify Him, and (during) the prostration's ends/backs.
And hear/listen a day/time the caller calls from a near/close place/position .
A day/time they hear/listen (to) the loud strong cry/torture raid with the truth , that (is) the Exit Day/Resurrection Day.
That We, We revive/make alive, and We make die, and to Us (is) the end/destination.
A day/time the earth/Planet Earth splits/cracks from them quickening/speeding/rushing, that (is a) gathering easy/small on Us.
We are more knowledgeable with what they say, and you are not on them with a tyrant , so remind with the Koran who fears My threat. 
And/by the scatterers/spreaders , scattering/spreading.
So the clouds carrying rain , a heavy weight.
So the flowing/orbiting , easily/flexibly.
So the apportioners/distributors a matter/affair/order/command.
Truly/indeed what you are being promised is truthful/true (E) .
And that truly the religion/debt/rule/might (is) happening/landing (E) .
And the sky/space (owner) of the paths/courses (movements/orbits) .
That you truly are in (E) (a) different word/statement .
Who was lied to/turned away from it, he (will) be lied to/turned away.
The liars/speculators were killed.
Those who, they are in an intoxication/hatred (are) careless/negligent .
They question/ask when (is) the Judgment Day/the Resurrection Day .
A day/time they are on the fire they are being tortured .
Taste/experience your misguidance/seduction this, which you were with it hurrying/hastening .
That truly the fearing and obeying (are) in treed gardens/paradises and water springs/wells.
Taking what their Lord gave them, that they were before that good doers.
They were little from the night what they (spend in) sleep .
And at the times at end of night before dawn they ask for forgiveness.
And in their properties/possessions (is) a share/duty for the asker/questioner/beggar and the deprived.
And in the earth/Planet Earth (are) evidences/signs for the sure/certain.
And in your selves, so do you not see/look/understand?
And in the sky/space (is) your provision and what you are being promised.
So with/by the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's Lord, that it truly is true (E) , equal/alike (to) what that you, you speak.
Did information/speech (of) Abraham's guests, the honoured, come to you?
When they entered on him, so they said: "A greeting/security/peace." He said: "A greeting/security/peace (you) unknown/disguised nation."
So he conned his way to his family/relation , so he came with a fat/fleshy (M) calf.
So he neared/approached it to them, he said: "Do you not eat?"
So he felt inner horror/fear from them, they said: "Do not fear." And they announced good news to him with a knowledgeable boy (son) .
So his woman (wife) approached/came in an outcry/frown, so she hit/struck (an act of surprise) her face/front and she said: "Old/weak, infertile."
They said: "As/like that your Lord said, that He truly, He is the wise/judicious, the knowledgeable."
He said: "So what (is) your matter/affair/concern, oh you the messengers?"
They said: "That we, we were sent to a nation committing crimes/sins."
To send on them stones from mud/clay .
Marked/identified/distinguished at your Lord for the spoilers/extravagators/wasters .
So We brought out who was in it from the believers.
So We did not find in it other than (a) house/home from the submitters/Moslems .
And We left in it an evidence/sign to those who fear the torture, the painful.
And in Moses when We sent him to Pharaoh with a clear/evident proof/evidence .
So he turned away at his corner/strong support, and he said: "A magician/sorcerer, or mad/insane."
So We punished/took him and his soldiers/warriors , so We discarded them/casted them off in the body of water, and he is blameworthy/blamed.
And in Aad, when We sent on them the wind/breeze, the infertile/sterile .
It does not leave from a thing it came on it, except it made it as/like the decomposed/decayed.
And in Thamud , when (it) was said to them: "Live long/enjoy until a time/period of time."
So they become arrogant/disobedient from their Lord's order/command, so the death/destructive torture punished/took them, and (while) they are looking/watching .
So they were not able from getting up/standing, and they were not victorious.
And Noah's nation from before, that they truly were a nation (of) debauchers .
And the sky/space We built/constructed it with power/support , and We (E) are extending/spreading (E) .
And the earth/Planet Earth We spread it out so the levelers/preparers (are) blessed/praise.
And from every thing We created a pair/couple , maybe/perhaps you mention/remember .
So escape/flee to God, that I am for you from Him a clear/evident warner/giver of notice.
And do not make/put with God another god, that I am for you from Him a clear/evident warner/giver of notice.
As/like that none from a messenger came to those from before them except (that) they said: "A magician/sorcerer, or mad/insane."
Do they command/entrust with it? But they are a tyrannizing/arrogant nation.
So turn away from them, so you are not with being blamed/reprimanded.
And remind, so that the reminder/remembrance benefits/becomes useful (to) the believers.
And I did not create the Jinns and the human/mankind except to worship Me.
I do not want/intend from them from provision , and I do not want/intend that (E) they feed Me.
That truly God, He is the provider, (owner) of the power/strength, the solid/sturdy .
So that to those who were unjust/oppressive (are) crimes, equal/alike (to) their company's/friends' crimes, so do not hurry/hasten Me . 
So calamity/scandal to those who disbelieved from their day/time which they are being promised. 
By/and the mountain.
By/and a Book written/inscribed/drafted.
In spread/publicized parchment .
By/and to the House/Home, the frequently visited/inhabited/populated.
By/and the roof/ceiling, the raised.
By/and the sea/ocean , the filled and overflowed .
That truly your Lord's torture (is) happening/falling (E) .
(There is) no repeller/pusher for it.
A day/time the sky/space agitates/moves from side to side quickly (in) agitation/quick movement from side to side .
And the mountains moves movement/manipulation .
So calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/falsifiers .
Those who, they are in a plunge/an engagement in conversation playing/amusing .
A day/time they are being called repeatedly to Hell's fire , repelling/pushing away violently and roughly.
This (is) the fire which you were with it lying/denying .
So is magic/sorcery that (so is that magic/sorcery)? Or you do not see/look/understand?
Roast/suffer it , so be patient or do not be patient, (it is) equal/alike on (to) you, but/truly you are being reimbursed what you were making/doing.
That truly the fearing and obeying (are) in treed gardens/paradises and blessing/comfort and ease .
Enjoying/joyful with what their Lord gave them, and their Lord protected them (from) the Hell's torture.
Eat and drink pleasurable/tasty because (of) what you were making/doing .
Reclining/resting on royal beds/sofas lined/arranged, and We got them married with (spouses of) eyes with intense blackness of pupils and whiteness (beautifully contrasted).
And those who believed and their descendants followed them with faith/belief, We made their descendants catch up/follow with them, and We did not reduce/diminish them from a thing from their deeds , each/every human with what he gained/won (is) accountable .
And We extended/spread them with fruits and flesh/meat from what they desire/crave .
They give each other in it a cup/wine , (there is) no nonsense/senseless talk in it, and nor sinning/committing crimes.
And servants/boys for them, circle/walk around on them, as if they are protected/covered pearls.
And some of them approached/came on (to) some (each other), they ask/question each other.
They said: "We were before in our people/family afraid/compassionate ."
So God blessed on us and He protected/preserved us (from) the severe hot's/burning wind's torture.
We were from before, we call Him, that He truly is, He is the righteous/charitable , the merciful/most merciful.
So remind, so you are not with your Lord's blessing with a fortune teller/highly ranked priest or rabbi ,and nor mad/insane.
Or they say: "A poet, we wait/remain with him the death's doubt/suspicion".
Say: "Wait/remain (watch) so that I am with you from the waiting/ remaining (watching)."
Or their minds/dreams order/command them with that, or they are a tyrannizing/arrogant nation?
Or they say: "He made it up." But/rather, they do not believe.
So they come (E) with an information/speech equal/alike to it, if they were truthful.
Or they were created from without a thing, or they are the creators?
Or they created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, but/rather they are not sure/certain?
Or at them (are) your Lord's safes/storages (treasures)? Or they are the dominators/controllers?
Or for them (is) a ladder, they hear/listen in (from) it? So their hearer/listener should come with a clear/evident proof/evidence/power .
Or for Him (are) the daughters, and for you (are) the sons?
Or you ask/question them (for) a reward/wage/fee, so they are from a burdensome debt heavy/burdened/loaded?
Or at them (is) the unseen/absent so they write/dictate ?
Or they want/intend a plot/conspiracy ? So those who disbelieved they are the plotted/conspired against .
Or for them (is) a god other than God? God's praise/glory from what they share/make partners (with Him).
And if they see/understand pieces from the sky/space dropping/falling they say: "Piled/accumulated/heaped clouds."
So leave them until they meet/find their day/time which in it they die/get thunderstruck .
A day/time their plotting/conspiracy does not enrich/suffice from them a thing, and nor they be given victory/aid.
And that truly to those who were unjust/oppressive (is) a torture other than that, and but most of them do not know.
And be patient for your Lord's judgment/rule, so that you are with Our eyes/sights, and praise/glorify with your Lord's praise/gratitude when you stand/get up .
And from the night so praise/glorify Him, and (at) the star's/planet's passings/ends (settings). 
By/and the star/planet if (it) fell/dropped .
Your companion/friend did not become misguided/lost , and did not become misguided/failed .
And (your friend) does not speak/clarify from the self attraction for desire .
That truly it is except inspiration/revelation (that) is being inspired/revealed .
The powers'/strength's strong (severe) taught/instructed him.
(Owner) of strength/wisdom , so he/He straightened/leveled.
And he/He (is) at/by the highest horizon/direction.
Then he neared, so he lowered/dropped.
So he was (a) short measure of length (of) two arm's/bow's (lengths) or nearer .
So he/He inspired/revealed to His worshipper/slave/servant what He inspired/revealed.
The heart did not lie/falsify what he/it saw/understood.
So do you argue/discuss with him on what he sees/understands?
And he had (E) seen/understood him another/other one descent.
At the lote-tree (at) the ultimate/absolute end .
At it (is) the shelter's/refuge's treed garden/paradise.
When what covers/darkens covers/darkens the lote-tree.
The eye sight/knowledge did not deviate/turn away, and (it) did not exceed the limit.
He had (E) seen/understood from his Lord's greatest/magnified evidences/signs .
Did you see/understand Allata/Hashtaroot (most famous idol goddess in pre-Islamic ignorance) and Elozza (idol statue)?
And Manat , the third the other?
Are for you the male and for Him the female?
That (is) then unjust apportionment/division .
That truly it is except names, you named it, you and your fathers/forefathers, God did not descend with it from a proof/evidence , that truly they follow except the doubt/suspicion , and what the selves desire/attract , and the guidance had (E) come to them from their Lord.
Or (is it) to the human/mankind what he wished/desired?
So to God (is) the end (other life) and the first/beginning.
And how many from (an) angel (is) in the skies/space, their mediation does not enrich/suffice a thing except from after that God permits/allows to whom He wills/wants/intends, and He accepts/approves.
That truly those who do not believe with (in) the end (other life) they name (E) the angels the female's naming.
And (there is) no knowledge for them with it, that truly they follow except the doubt/suspicion , and that truly the doubt/suspicion does not enrich/suffice from the truth a thing.
So turn away from who turned away from mentioning/remembering Us , and he did not want/intend except the life the present/worldly life .
That (is) their capacity/limit from the knowledge, that truly your Lord, He is more knowledgeable with who was misguided from His way/path , and He is more knowledgeable with who was guided.
And to God what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, to reimburse those who did bad/evil because (of) what they made/did , and reimburse those who did good with the best/goodness .
Those who avoid/distance themselves (from) the sin's/crime's greatest/biggest and the enormous/atrocious deeds , except the minor sins , that truly your Lord (is) rich/spread (in) the forgiveness, He is more knowledgeable with (of) you, when He created/originated you from the earth/Planet Earth and when you are embryos/fetuses/hidden in your mother's bellies/insides, so do not commend/claim righteousness (for) yourselves, He is more knowledgeable with who feared and obeyed.
So did you see/understand who turned away?
And gave little and skimped/stinged?
Is it at him the unseen's/absents knowledge so he sees/understands ?
Or he did not get informed with what (is) in Moses' sheets/pages (scriptures) ?
And Abraham who fulfilled/completed.
That no sinner/burdener bears/carries another's sin/burden .
And that (E) (there is) not to the human except what he strived/endeavored .
And that (E) his striving/endeavor will be seen.
Then he (will) be reimbursed the reimbursement , the most fulfilling/completing.
And that truly to your Lord (is) the ultimate/absolute end.
And that He made laugh,and He made to weep .
And that He made to die , and He revived/gave life .
And that He created the pairs/couples , the male and the female.
From a drop/males or female's secretion , if/when (it be) ejaculated/discharged semen/sperm.
And that on Him (is) the creation , the other.
And that He, He enriched/sufficed , and He made content/satisfied .
And that He is the star's (dog star's) Lord .
And that He destroyed Aad the first/beginning.
And Thamud , so none (were) left/protected .
And Noah's nation from before, that they truly were, they (were) more unjust/oppressive, and more tyrant/arrogant .
And the overturned/destroyed (city was) more dropping/tumbling down .
So covered/came upon it what covers .
So with which (of) your Lord's blessings (do) you argue/discuss? 
That (is) a warning/notice from the warnings/notices , the first/beginning.
The Resurrection approached/neared.
(There is) not a remover/uncoverer (reliever) for it from other than God.
Is it from this the information/speech you wonder/surprise ?
And you laugh/wonder, and you do not weep ?
And you are astonished singing/arrogant ?
So prostrate to God and worship. 
The Hour/Resurrection neared/approached, and the moon split/cracked/cut open .
And if they see an evidence/sign they oppose/turn away , and they say: "Continuous magic/sorcery."
And they lied/denied , and they followed their self attractions for desires, and each/every matter/affair (is) settled/established .
And had (E) come to them from the information/news what in it (is) prevention/deterrence .
Reaching/eloquent wisdom, so the warnings/notices, it does not enrich/satisfy/suffice.
So turn away from them, a day/time the caller/requester calls/requests/prays to (for) an awful/obscene thing.
Their eyesights/understanding (are) humble/submissive , they get out/emerge from the graves as though they are spread out grasshoppers/locusts.
Coming rushing in fear to the caller/requester, the disbelievers say: "That (is) a day/time (of) difficult(ty)/hard(ship) ."
Noah's nation lied/denied before them, so they lied/denied Our worshipper/slave/servant , and they said: "Mad/insane." And he was prevented/ousted .
So he called his Lord: "That I am defeated/conquered , so give (me) victory/aid."
So We opened the sky's doors/entrances, with water pouring/flowing strongly .
And We burst/over flowed the land/Earth (into) water springs/wells, so the (rain and well) water met on an order/command (that) had been predestined/estimated .
And We carried/lifted him on that of boards/sheets/planks and nails/ship ropes/dowels.
It flows with Our eyes/sights, a reimbursement to who was disbelieved with/denied .
And We had (E) left it (as) an evidence/sign , so is there from a rememberer?
So how was My torture and My warnings/notices?
And We have (E) eased/made the Koran flexible to the remembrance/reminder, so is there from a rememberer?
Aad lied/denied , so how was My torture and My warnings/notices?
That We sent on them a wind/breeze blowing/severely cold , in a continuos unlucky/miserable day/time.
It removes/pulls the people as if they are extracted/dead palm trees' ends.
So how was My torture and My warnings/notices?

God prepared for them a strong (severe) torture, that they are bad/evil/harmful (in) what they were making/doing .
They took their rights/oaths (as) a cover (shield), so they prevented/obstructed from God's way/path , so for them (is) a humiliating/degrading torture.
Their properties/possessions and nor their children will never/not enrich/suffice from them from God a thing, those are the fire's owners/company/friends, they are in it immortally/eternally .
A day/time God sends/resurrects them all/all together, so they swear to Him, as/like they swear to you, and they think/suppose, that they are on a thing; are they not, that they truly they are the liars/deniers/falsifiers?
The devil dominated/defeated on them, so he made them forget God's reminder/mention, those are the devil's group/party . Are not the devil's group/party they are the losers ?
That truly those who anger God and His messenger, those are in the most humiliated/disgraced .
God wrote/decreed : "I will defeat/conquer (E) , I, and My messengers." That truly God (is) strong, glorious/mighty .
You will not find a nation believing by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, they love/show affection (befriend) who angered God and His messenger, and even if they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their father's near relations/tribe, those God wrote/decreed in their hearts/minds the faith/belief, and He supported them with a Soul/Sprit from Him, and He makes them enter/enters them treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flows from beneath it immortally/eternally in it, God accepted/approved of them, and they accepted/approved of Him, those are God's group/party , is (it) not that (E) God's group/party , they are the successful/winners? 
Praised/glorified to God what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
He is who brought out those who disbelieved from The Book's people from their homes/countries to the gathering's beginning, you did not think/assume that (E) they emerge , and they thought/assumed , that they, their fortresses/fortification are protecting them/making them invincible from God, so God came to them from where/when they did not think/suppose, and He threw/hurled in their hearts/minds the terror/fright, they destroy/demolish their houses/homes with their hands, and the believers' hands, so be warned/cautioned, you (owners) of the eye sights/knowledge.
Where it not for that (E) God wrote/decreed the departure/moving out on them, He would have tortured them in the present world, and for them in the end (other life is) the fire's torture.
That (is) with that they defied/disobeyed God and His messenger, and who defies/disobeys God, so then God (is) strong (severe) in the punishment.
What you cut off from a palm , or you left it standing on its roots , so (it is) with God's permission/pardon, and to reimburse the debauchers .
And what God bestowed upon/gave spoils of war on His messenger from them, so you did not hurry/rush on him from horses, and nor camels ridden or loaded/riders , and but God empowers His messengers on whom He wills/wants , and God is on every thing capable. (Whatever God gave His messenger is not from your support but through God's blessing.)
What God bestowed upon/gave spoils of war on His messenger from the villages'/urban cities' people , so (it is) to God and the messenger, and to of the relations/near, and the orphans , and the poorest of poor/poor oppressed, and the traveler/stranded traveler, in order that (it) not be a rotation/alternation between the rich from you, and what the messenger gave you , so take/receive it , and what he forbid/prevented you from it, so terminate/stop , and fear and obey God, so that truly God (is) strong (severe in) the punishment.
To the poorest of poor/poor oppressed the emigrants those who were brought out/driven out from their houses/homes and their properties/possessions , they wish/desire grace/favour from God, and an acceptance/approval , and they give victory/aid (to) God and His messenger, those, they are the truthful.
And those who resided/settled the house/home and the faith/belief from before them, they love/like who emigrated to them, and they do not find in their chests (innermosts) a need/necessity from what they were given/brought, and they prefer/choose (the immigrants) over themselves and even if (it) was neediness/poverty with them, and who is protected (from) his self', so those are the successful/winners.
And those who came from after them, they say: "Our Lord forgive for us, and to our brothers, those who preceded us with (to) the faith/belief, and do not make/put in our hearts/minds hatred/animosity to those who believed, our Lord, that you are merciful/compassionate, merciful."
Did you not see to those who exercised hypocrisy, they say to their brothers those who disbelieved from The Books' people: "If (E) you were brought out, we will go out (E) with you. And we do not obey anyone in (from) you ever (E), and if you were fought/killed, We will give you victory/aid (E)." And God witnesses/testifies that they truly are liars/deniers/falsifiers (E).
If (E) they were brought/driven out, they do not get out with them, and if (E) they were fought/killed, they do not give them victory/aid, and if (E) they gave them victory/aid, they will turn away (E) (on) the backs/ends, then, they do not be given victory/aid.
You are (E) stronger terror/fright in their chests (innermosts) than God, that (is) with that they (are) a nation not understanding/knowing .
They do not fight/kill you all/all together, except in fortified/protected villages/urban cities, or from behind walls, their courage/power between them (is) strong (severe), you think/suppose them (to be) all/all together, and their hearts/minds (are) separate/different , that (is) with that they are a nation not reasoning/comprehending .
As/like (the) example/proverb, (of) those from before them near/close (shortly), they tasted/experienced their matters'/affair's severity/bad consequences , and for them (is) a painful torture.
As/like (the) example/proverb (of) the devil, when he said to the human/mankind: "Disbelieve." So when he (the human) disbelieved, he said: "I am innocent/renouncing from you, that I, I fear God, the creations all together's/(universes') Lord."
So their (B)'s end (result) was that they (B) (are) in the fire immortally/eternally in it, and that (is) the unjust's/oppressive's reimbursement.
You, you those who believed, fear and obey God, and a self should watch/consider what it advanced/presented for tomorrow/(the) future, and fear and obey God, that truly God (is) expert/experienced, with what you make/do .
And do not be as/like those who forgot God, so He made them forget themselves, those, they are the debauchers .
The fire's owners/company/friends and the treed garden's/paradise's owners/company/friends, do not become equal/alike, the treed garden's/paradise's owners/company/friends, they are the successful/triumphant .
If We descended this the Koran on (a) mountain you would have seen/understood it humble/submissive splitting/cracking from God's fear, and those are the examples/proverbs We give it for the people, maybe/perhaps they think.
He is God, He whom (there is) no God except Him, knower (of) the unseen/invisible/ supernatural and the testimony/presence , He is the merciful, the most merciful . 
He is God, which (there is) no God except Him, the king/owner/possessor , the holy/sanctimonious/ glorified , the safety/security/peace , the confirmer/believer , the guardian/protector , the glorious/mighty , the almighty/tremendous , the greatened/proud/arrogant , God's praise/glory from what they share/make partners (with Him).
He is God, the creator , the creator , the shaper/former/image maker , for Him (are) the names the good/most beautiful , what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, praise/glorify to Him, and He is the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious. 
You, you those who believed, do not take My enemy and your enemy (as) guardians/allies , you throw to them with the love/affection, and they had disbelieved with what came to you from the truth , they drive/bring out the messenger and you, (because) that (E) you believe with (in) God your Lord, if you had gotten out/appeared struggling/defending for the faith in My way/path , and wishing/desiring My acceptances/approvals , you keep secret to them with the love/affection, and I am more knowledgeable with what you hid, and what you declared/publicized , and who makes/does it from you, so he had been misguided/lost (from) the way's/path's straightness/middle .
If they defeat/overcome you they be for you enemies, and they extend/spread their hands and their tongues to you with the bad/evil/harm, and they wished/loved if you disbelieve.
Your relations and nor your children will never/not benefit you (on) the Resurrection Day, He separates/judges/decides between you, and God (is) with what you make/do seeing/knowing
A good example/model (to follow) had been for you in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their nation: "We are innocent/separating from you, and from what you worship from other than God, we disbelieved with you, and the animosity and the intense hatred appeared between us and between you (for) ever (E), until you believe with (in) God alone." Except Abraham's word/statement to his father: "I will ask for forgiveness for you, and I do not own/possess for you from God from a thing, our Lord, on You we relied depended (on) , and to You we returned/repented , and to You (is) the end/destination."
Our Lord do not make/put us (as) a test/allurement to those who disbelieved, and forgive for us, our Lord, that You truly are, You are, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious .
A good example/model (to follow) had been for you in them, to who was hoping/expecting God, and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day; and who turns away, so then God, He is the rich, the praiseworthy/commendable.
Maybe/perhaps that (E) God makes/puts between you, and between those whom you made animosity with, from them, love/affection/friendship, and God (is) capable/able , and God (is) forgiving, merciful.
God does not forbid/prevent you from those who did not fight/kill you in the religion, and they did not bring/drive you out from your houses/countries , that (E) you be righteous/charitable/truthful to them, and be just/equitable to them, that truly God loves/likes the just/equitable.
But God forbids/prevents you from those who fought/killed you in the religion, and they brought/drove you out from your houses/countries , and they cooperated/supported on forcing/driving you out , that (E) you follow them, and who follows them, so those, they are the unjust/oppressive.
You, you those who believed, if the believing females came to you emigrating , so test/examine them (F) , God (is) more knowing with their faith/belief, so if you knew them (F) (to be) believers (F), so do not return them to the disbelievers, they (F) are not permitted/allowed for them, and nor they (the disbelievers) be permitted/allowed for them (F), and give them what they spent, and (there is) no offense/sin that (E) youmarry them (F) if you gave them (F) their rewards (dowries) , and do not hold fast/grasp/seize with the (insisting) disbelievers' ties/bonds (discontinue marriage to disbelieving women), and ask (for) what you spent, and they should ask (for) what they spent, that (is) God's judgment/rule, He judges/rules between you, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
And if a thing passed you from your spouses to the disbelievers, (so if you lost some of your possessions to disbelieving wives that left you) so you punished , so bring those whom their spouses went/took away (reimburse spouses of disbelievers) similar/equal (to) what they spent, and fear and obey God, whom you are with (in) Him believing.
You, you the prophet, if the believers (F) came to you, they (F) pledge/swear to you loyalty on that (E) they (F) not share/make partners with God a thing, and nor they (F) steal/rob, and nor they (F) commit adultery/fornication , and nor they (F) kill their (F) children, and nor they (F) do/commit with falsehood/slander (that) they (F) fabricate it between their (F) hands and their (F) feet, and nor they (F) disobey you in known/generosity , so pledge/swear to them (F) loyalty, and ask for forgiveness (P) for them (F) (from) God, that truly God (is) forgiving, merciful.
You, you those who believed, do not follow a nation God became angry/angered on them, they had despaired/become hopeless from the end (other life), as/like the disbelievers despair/become hopeless from the graves'/burial place's owners  
What (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth praise/glorify to God, and He is the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
You, you those believed, why/for what (do) you say what you do not make/do ?
Abhorrence/hatred became big at God that (E) you say what you do not make/do .
That truly God loves/likes those who fight in His way/path (in) a row/line as if they are (a) sticking together and (a) well arranged building/structure.
And when Moses said to his nation: "You my nation, why/for what (do) you harm mildly/harm me, and you have known that I am God's messenger to you?" So when they deviated/turned away, God deviated/turned away their hearts/minds , and God does not guide the nation, the debauchers .
And when Jesus Mary's son said: "You Israel's sons and daughters, that I am God's messenger to you, confirming to what (is) between my hands from the Torah, and an announcer of good news with a messenger (that) comes from after me, his name (is) Ahmad ." So when he came to them with the evidences, they said: "That (is) clear/evident magic/sorcery."
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated/cut and split the lies/falsehood , and He is being called to the Islam/submission/surrender to God? And God does not guide the nation, the unjust/oppressive.
They want/intend to extinguish/put out God's light with their mouths, and God (is) completing His light, and even if the disbelievers hated (it).
He is who sent His messenger with the guidance, and the truth's religion, to make it visible/overcome on the religion all of it, and even if the sharers/takers of partners (with God) hated (it).
You, you those who believed, do I guide/lead you on (to) commercial trade/buying and selling (that) saves/rescues you from a painful torture?
You believe with (in) God and His messenger, and you struggle/exert in God's way/path with your possessions/wealths and your selves, that (is) best for you if you were knowing .
He forgives for you your crimes, and He enters you treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, and good/beautiful residences in treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, that (is) the winning/success , the great.
And another (others) you love/like it, victory/aid from God and a near/close opening/victory , and announce good news (to) the believers.
You, you those who believed, be God's supporters , as/like Jesus Mary's son said to the faithful and pure friends/deciples : "Who (are) my victoriors/supporters to God?" The faithful and pure friends/deciples said: "We are God's victoriors/supporters ." So a group of people from Israel's sons and daughters believed, and a group of people disbelieved, so We supported those who believed over their enemy, so they became conquering/defeating
What (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth praise/glorify to God, the king/owner/possessor, the Holy/Sanctimonious/Glorified , the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
He is who sent in the illiterates/belongers to a nation a messenger from them, he reads/recites on them His verses/evidences , and he purifies them , and he teaches/instructs them The Book , and the wisdom , and (even) if, they were from before in (E) clear/evident , misguidance.
And others from them did not (E) catch up/join (E) with them, and He is the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious.
That (is) God's grace/favour/blessing, He gives/brings it (to) whom He wills/intends , and God (is) (owner) of the grace/favour/blessing, the great.
(The) example/proverb (of) those who were made to carry/endure the Torah then they did not carry/endue it (are) as/like (the) example/proverb (of) the donkey, (it) carries/endures portions of the Torah , how bad (is the) example/proverb (of) the nation those who denied/falsified with God's verses/evidences? And God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive.
Say: "You, you those who repented/guided/Jews, if you claimed/purorted that you are followers/ supporters/allies to God from other than the people, so wish/desire the death/ lifelessness if you were truthful."
And they do not wish/desire it ever (E) because (of) what their hands advanced/presented, and God (is) knowledgeable with the unjust/oppressors.
Say: "That truly the death/lifelessness which you run away/flee from it, so that it truly is meeting/finding you , then you be returned to knower (of) the unseen/hidden/super natural and the testimony/presence , so He informs you with what you were making/doing ."
You, you those who believed, if (it) was called to the prayers from the Friday's/gathering's day/time, so hasten/move quickly to God's reminder/mention, and leave the selling/trading, that (is) best for you, if you were knowing.
So if the prayers were accomplished/ended , so spread/spread out in the Earth/land , and ask/wish/desire from God's grace/favour/blessing, and mention/remember/praise/ glorify God much, maybe/perhaps you succeed/win.
And if they saw/understood commercial trade/buying and selling or play things/amusement , they scattered/separated to it, and they left you standing , say: "What (is) at God (is) better than the play things/amusement and from the commercial trade/buying and selling, and God (is) best (of) the providers."
If/when the hypocrites came to you, they said: "We testify/witness, that you are God's messenger (E)." And God knows that you are His messenger (E), and God witnesses/testifies that truly the hypocrites (are) liars/deniers/ falsifiers (E).
They took their rights/oaths (as) a cover (shield) so they prevented/obstructed from God's way/path , that they truly are bad/evil/harmful what they were making/doing .
That (is) because they (E) believed, then they disbelieved, so (it) was stamped/sealed on their hearts/minds , so they do not understand/learn .
And if you saw them , their bodies pleases/marvels you, and if they say (talk), you hear/listen to their statement/word as if they are supported wood (logs), they think/suppose each/ every loud strong cry/torture raid is on (against) them, they are the enemy, so be warned/cautious (of) them , God fought them , (so) where/how (do) they be turned away ?
And when/if (it) was said to them: "Come, God's messenger asks for forgiveness for you." They twisted/turned/ bent their heads, and you saw them preventing/obstructing , and they are arrogant.
(It is) equal/alike on (for) them (if) you asked for forgiveness for them, or you did not ask for forgiveness for them, God will never/not forgive for them, that truly God does not guide the nation, the debauchers .
They are those who say: "Do not spend on whom (is) at God's messenger, until they scatter/separate And to God (are) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's safes/storages (treasures), and but the hypocrites do not understand/learn .
They say: "If (E) we returned to the city/town, the more dignified/honoured will bring out (exile) the most humiliated/weakest ." And to God (is) the glory/might/power , and to His messenger, and to the believers, and but the hypocrites do not know.
You, you those who believed, (let) not your properties/possessions/wealths and nor your children distract/preoccupy you from mentioning/remembering God, and who makes/does that, so those, they are the losers/misguided .
And spend from what We provided for you, from before that the death/lifelessness comes (to) one of you, so he says: "My Lord, if only You delayed me to a near/close term/time, so I will give charity and I will be from correct, righteous."
And God will never/not delay a self if its term/time came, and God (is) expert/experienced with what you make/do
What (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth praise/glorify to God, for Him (is) the ownership/kingdom , and for Him (is) the praise/gratitude , and He is on every thing capable/able .
He is who created you, so from you (is) a disbeliever, and from you (is) a believer, and God (is) with what you make/do seeing/knowing .
He created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth , and He pictured/shaped/formed you, so He did good (in) your pictures/shapes/forms, and to Him (is) the end/destination.
He knows what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He knows what you keep secret, and what you declare/publicize , and God (is) knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts).
Did not news/information come to you (of) those who disbelieved from before? So they tasted/experienced their matter's/affair's severity/bad consequences , and for them (is) a painful torture.
That (is) because that their messengers were coming to them with evidences, so they said: "Are humans guiding us?" So they disbelieved, and they turned away, and God sufficed (was not in need), and God (is) rich, praiseworthy/commendable.
Those who disbelieved claimed/purported , that (E) they will never/not be resurrected/revived , say: "Yes/certainly, and by my Lord, you will be resurrected/revived (E) , then you will be informed (E) with what you made/did , and that (is) on God easy/little ."
So believe with (in) God and His messenger and the light which We descended, and God (is) with what you make/do expert/experienced.
A day/time He gathers/collects you to the Gathering Day/Resurrection Day, that (is) Day of the Forgetfulness/Cheating (the day people feel cheated by the short worldly life) and who believed with (in) God and makes/does correct/righteous deeds, He covers/substitutes from him his sins/crimes, and He makes him enter treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, immortally/eternally in it (for) ever (E), that (is) the winning/success, the great.
And those who disbelieved and lied/denied with Our evidences/verses , those are the fire's owners/company/friends (they are) immortally/eternally in it, and how bad (is) the end/destination?
None from a disaster struck/hit except with God's permission , and who believes with (in) God, He guides his heart/mind , and God (is) with every thing knowledgeable.
And obey God, and obey the messenger, so if you turned away, so but on Our messenger (is only) the information/communication , the clear/evident .
God, (there is) no God except Him, and on God so should rely/depend the believers.
You, you those who believed, that truly from your spouses and your children (is) an enemy for you, so be warned/cautious of them , and if you forgive/pardon and you forgive/pardon , and you forgive , so then God (is) forgiving, merciful.
But/truly your properties/possessions and your children, (are) a test/seduction and God, at Him (is) a great reward .
So fear and obey God, as long as you were able, and hear/listen and obey and spend goodness for yourselves, and who is protected (against) his self's miserliness/stinginess (who tamed his self's love towards accumulating money etc.), so those, they are the successful/winners.
If you lend/advance God a good/beautiful loan/advance, He doubles/multiplies it for you, and He forgives for you, and God (is) thankful/grateful, clement .
Knower (of) the unseen/supernatural (future), and the testimony/presence , the glorious/mighty ,the wise/judicious. 
You, you the prophet, if you divorced the women, so divorce them (F) to their term (F), and count/calculate the menstrual cycle/term and fear and obey God, your Lord, do not bring them out from their (F) houses/homes, and they (F) do not get out except that they do/commit with an evident enormous/atrocious deed , and those are God's limits/boundaries/orders, and who transgresses/violates God's limits/boundaries/orders, so he had caused injustice/oppression (to) his self, you do not know, maybe/perhaps God initiates/causes after that a matter/affair (event) .
So if they (F) reached (completed) their term/time, so hold/grasp them (F) with kindness/generosity or separate from them (F) with kindness/generosity , and call a witness (two owners) (B) of justice/equality from you, and keep up/take care of the testimony/certification to God, that is being preached/advised/warned with it who was believing with (in) God, and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day; and who fears and obeys God, He makes/puts for him a way out/exit.
And He provides for him from where/when he does not think/suppose, and who relies/depends on God, so He is enough for him, that truly God (is) delivering/accomplishing His order/command , God had made/put to every thing a predestiny/quantity/value.
And those (F) who became infertile/despaired from the menstruation from your women, if you became doubtful/suspicious, so their term/count (is) three months, and those (F) who did not menstruate, and (those) of the pregnant , their term/time (is) that (E) they (F) give birth/drop their (F) off spring/loads/pregnancies , and who fears and obeys God, He makes/puts from his matter/affair ease/flexibility.
That (is) God's order/command, He descended it to you, and who fears and obeys God, He covers/substitutes from him his sins/crimes and He magnifies for him a reward .
Reside/make them (F) live from where you resided from your wealth/capability , and do not harm them (F) to tighten/strain on them (F), and if they (F) were of pregnancy so spend on them until they give birth/drop their loads/off spring/pregnancy , so if they (F) breast fed for you (wet nursed), so give/bring them their (F) rewards , and consult each other, between you with kindness/generosity , and if you had difficulty/hardship , so another will breast feed (wet nurse) for him.
(The owner) of a wealth/abundance (is) to spend from his wealth/abundance, and whom his provision was tightened/strained on him, so he should spend from what God gave him, God does not burden/impose (on) a self except what He gave it, God will make/create after difficulty/hardship , ease/flexibility.
And how many from a village/urban city (that) disobeyed from its Lord's order/command and His messengers, so We counted/calculated (with) it (a) strong (severe) account/calculation, and We tortured it (an) awful/severe torture?
So it tasted/experienced its matter's/affair's severity/consequences , and its matter's/affair's end/turn (result) was a loss/misguidance and perishment.
God prepared for them a strong (severe) torture, so fear and obey God you (owners) of the pure minds/hearts , those who believed, God had descended to you a reminder/remembrance.
A messenger, he reads/recites on you God's evident verses/evidences , to bring/drive out those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds from the darknesses to the light, and who believes with (in) God and makes/does correct/righteous deeds, He enters him (into) treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, immortally/eternally in it (for) ever (E), God had bettered for him a provision .
God is who created seven skies/space(s), and from the earth/Planet Earth equal/similar to them (F), the command/matter descends between them, to know that (E) God (is) on every thing capable/able , and that (E) God had comprehended/enveloped with every thing knowledge. 
You, you the prophet, why/for what (do) you forbid/prohibit what God permitted/allowed for you, you wish/desire your wives' approvals/satisfactions , and God (is) forgiving, merciful.
God had commanded/made a duty for you, expiation/oath dissolution dues (of) your oaths , and God is your ally/master , and He is the knowledgeable, the wise/judicious.
And when the prophet confided to some (of) his wives an information/speech, so when she informed with it (others) and God made it apparent/visible on (to) him, he made some of it known and he opposed from some, so when he informed her with it, she said: "Who informed you (of) this?" He said: "The knowledgeable, the expert/experienced informed me."
If you (B) repent to God, so your (B)'s hearts/minds had inclined/listened, and if they (B) cooperated/supported each other on (against) him, so then God, He is his guardian/ally , and Gabriel, and (the) correct/righteous (of) the believers, and the angels after that (are) a supporter/helper.
Maybe/perhaps his Lord if he divorced you (F) that He exchanges/replaces for him wives better than you, Moslems/submitters , believers, worshipping humbly, , repentant, worshipping , fasting and secluded in mosques (devout) , divorced/widowed/non-virgin , and first borns/virgins .
You, you those who believed, protect your selves and your families/people (from) a fire, its fuel (is) the people and the stones, on it (are) angels hard/rough , strong (severe), they do not disobey God what He ordered/commanded them, and they make/do what they are ordered/commanded.
You, you those who disbelieved, do not apologize/excuse yourselves the day/today, but/truly you are being reimbursed what you were making/doing .
You, you those who believed, repent to God, a sincere/honest (E) repentance, maybe/perhaps your Lord that He covers/substitutes from you your sins/crimes, and He makes you enter treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, a day/time God does not shame/scandalize (disappoint) the prophet and those who believed with Him, their light strives/moves quickly between their hands, and at their rights , they say: "Our Lord complete for us our light, and forgive for us, that You are on every thing capable/able ."
You, you the prophet, do your utmost/struggle (against) the disbelievers and the hypocrites , and be hard/strong on them, and their shelter/refuge (is) Hell , and how bad (is) the end/destination?
God gave an example/proverb to those who disbelieved, Noah's woman (wife), and Lot's woman (wife), they (B) were under (at) two worshippers (B) from Our worshippers (the) correct/righteous, so they (B) betrayed/were unfaithful to them (B), so they (B) did not enrich/avail from them (B) from God a thing, and (it was) said: "Enter (B) the fire with the entering."
And God gave an example/proverb to those who believed, Pharaoh's woman (wife) when she said: "My Lord build/construct for me at You a house/home in the Paradise and save/rescue me from Pharaoh and his deed, and save/rescue me from the nation the unjust/oppressive ."
And Mary Amran's daughter who remained chaste (protected) her genital parts between her legs, so We blew in it from Our Soul/Spirit , and she confirmed/was truthful with her Lord's words/expressions, and His Books , and she was from the worshipping humbly  
Blessed who with His hand (is) the ownership/kingdom , and He is on every thing capable/able.
Who created the death/lifelessness and the life to test you which of you (is) better (in) deeds, and He is the glorious/mighty , the forgiving.
Who created seven skies/space(s) (in) stages/layers , you do not see in the merciful's creation from discrepancy/inconsistency , so return the eyesight do you see from splits/cracks/cleaves?
Then return the eyesight two times/repetitions , the eyesight returns to you diminished/humiliated and it is grieving/uncovered .
And We had decorated/beautified, the sky/space (of) the present world with lights/stars , and We made it meteorites/shooting stars for the devils, and We prepared/made ready for them the/blazing/inflamed (inferno) torture.
And for those who disbelieved with (in) their Lord, Hell's torture, and how bad (is) the end/destination?
When they were thrown in it, they heard for it loud inhalation/loud noise and it, it boils with anger.
It is about to/almost distinguish/separate from the anger/rage, when ever (a) group/band/crowd were thrown in it, its safe-keepers asked them: "Did not a warner/giver of notice come to you?"
They said: "Yes/certainly, a warner/giver of notice had come to us, so we lied/denied/falsified, and we said: 'God did not descend from a thing, that truly you are except in big/great misguidance.'"
And they said: "If we were hearing/listening or reasoning/comprehending we would not have been in (between) the blazing's/inflamed's (inferno's) owners/company/friends."
So they confessed/acknowledged with their crime, so distance/remoteness , to the blazing's/inflamed's (inferno's) owners/company/friends.
That truly those who fear their Lord with the unseen/supernatural , for them (is) a forgiveness and a large/great reward .
And keep your opinion and belief/statement secret, or you publicize/declare with it, that He truly is knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts).
Does he not know whom He created? And He is the most kind/gracious , the expert/ experienced.
He is who made/put for you the earth/Planet Earth manipulated/eased , so walk in its directions/elevations , and eat from His provision, and to him (is) the revival/resurrection.
Did you become safe/secure (trust) whom (are) in the sky/space that (E) He sinks down with you the earth/Planet Earth, so then it agitates/sways ?
Or did you become safe/secure (trust) whom (are) in the sky/space that (E) He sends on you a violent wind carrying pebbles and hail/hail laden clouds? So you will know how was My warning/notice.
And those from before them had (E) lied/denied/falsified, so how was My severity (anger) ?
Do they not see to the birds above them expanded and motionless wings in a row, and they stretch and shrink/speed ? None holds/grasps them except the merciful, that He truly is with every thing seeing/understanding .
Or who (is) that who he is soldiers/warriors for you (and who are your allies that) give you victory/aid from other than the merciful? That truly the disbelievers (are) except in deceit/temptation.
Or who (is) that who provides for you if He held (back)/seized His provision? But they persisted, excessed and insisted in arrogance/disobedience and hastening with aversion .
Is who walks up-side-down/facing down on his face/front more guided? Or who walks straight/upright on a straight/direct road/way?
Say: "He is who created/originated you , and made for you the hearing/listening , and the eyesights/knowledge, and the hearts , little (is) what you thank/be grateful."
Say: "He is who created/seeded you in the earth/Planet Earth and to Him you are being gathered."
And they say: "When/at what time (is) that the promise if you were truthful?"
Say: "But/truly the knowledge (is) at God, and but/truly I am a clear/evident warner/giver of notice."
So when they saw it in close proximity/close , those who disbelieved's faces/fronts became bad/evil/harmful, and (it) was said: "That (is) what you were with it calling (hastening)."
Say: "Did you see if God punished/destroyed me and who (is) with me? Or had mercy upon us? So who protects/defends the disbelievers from a painful torture?"
Say: "He is the merciful, we believed with (in) Him and on Him we relied/depended , so you will know who He is in clear/evident misguidance."
Say: "Did you see/understand if your water became/became in the morning deeply sunk/bottomed ? So who comes/brings to you with water flowing easily and plentifully?" 
N and the writing utensil/pen and what they write/inscribe/draft.
you are not with your Lord's blessing/goodness with mad/insane.
And that truly for you (is) a reward (E) not interrupted/weakened (continuous).
And that you are on (E) great nature/character.
So you will see/look/understand, and they (will) see/look/understand.
With which of you (is) the insane.
That truly your Lord He is more knowing with who misguided from His way/path , and He is more knowing with the guided.
So do not obey the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
They wished/desired if you grease/flatter with hypocrisy , so they grease/flatter with hypocrisy .
And do not obey every/each habitual swearer despised/humiliated .
Backbiter/urger , walking gossiper with slander/malice .
Miser/often preventing to the good/generosity , transgressor/violator , sinner/criminal.
Rough/rude , after that a known mean low or evil person .
That (E) he was (owner) of property/wealth and sons and daughters.
If Our verses/evidences are read/recited on him, he said: "The first's/beginner's myths ."
We will brand him by fire/mark him on the nose/trunk/snout (usually used for elephants).
We (E) tested them as/like We tested the treed garden's owners/friends/company when they swore/made oath (that) they will cut it off (E) (will harvest it) by the morning/day break.
And nor they exempt/make exception.
So a circler/walker (twister/tornado) circled/walked on them, and (while) they are sleeping/quiet/ still .
So it became/became in the morning as/like the harvested land/isolated sandy area .
So they called each other in the morning/daybreak:
That (E) go early on (to) your cultivation/plantation if you were cutting/shearing off (harvesting).
So they left/set out , and they are conversing quietly:
That (E) no poor oppressed enters it (E) on you today/the day.
And they went early on anger/prevention , capable/able .
So when they saw it, they said: "That we are misguided (E)."
But we are deprived.
Their most honoured/moderate said: "Did I not say to you if only you praise/glorify?"
They said: "Our Lord's praise/glory, we were unjust/oppressive."
So some/part of them approached/came on (to) some (each other) blaming/reprimanding each other.
They said: "Oh, our calamity , we (E), we were tyrannizing/arrogant ."
Maybe/perhaps that (E) our Lord exchanges/substitutes (for) us better than it, that we are to our Lord desiring/wishing.
As/like that (is) the torture, and the end's (other life's) torture (E) (is) greater if they were knowing.
That truly to the fearing and obeying at their Lord (are) the blessed treed gardens/paradises.
Do We make the Moslems/submitters as the criminals/sinners?
What/why (is it) for you, how you judge/rule?
Or for you (is) a Book in it you study/read ?
That for you in it (is) what (E) you prefer choose.
Or for you (are) rights/oaths on Us reaching to the Resurrection Day, that for you then (is) what (E) you judge/rule.
Ask/question them which of them (is) with that a leader/grantor?
Or for them (are) partners (with God)? So they should come with their partners (with God) if they were truthful.
A day/time being uncovered/(relieved) of (a) shin/leg, and they be/are being called repeatedly to the prostration, so they are not able.
Their eyesights/understanding (are) humble/submissive , humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses them , and they had become being called repeatedly to the prostration and they are safe/secure.
So leave Me and who lies/denies/falsifies with this the information/speech, We will lead them gradually from where/when they do not know.
And I extend for them in time/life , that truly My plotting/conspiring (is) solid/strong .
Or (do) you ask/question them (for) a wage/fee so they are heavy/loaded/burdened from (a) burdensome debt?
Or at them (is) the unseen/absent/(future) , so they are writing/dictating/ordering?
So be patient for your Lord's judgment/rule, and do not be as the large fish's/whale's owner/friend/company when he called/cried and he is held/quietened/suppressed.
Had it not been for a blessing/goodness from his Lord, (that) caught up (to)/reached him , he would have been discarded/cast off at the open/space, and he is blamed/defamed .
So his Lord chose/purified him, so He made him from the correct/righteous.
And if those who disbelieved were about/almost to make you stumble/slip (E) with their eyesights when they heard/listened (to) the remembrance/reminder (the Koran), and they say: "That he truly is mad/insane (E) ".
And he/it is not except a reminder to the creations all together/(universes). 
The disaster/catastrophe/reality .
What is the disaster/catastrophe/reality ?
And what makes you know what (is) the disaster/catastrophe/reality ?
Thamud and Aad lied/denied/falsified with the Resurrection/disaster/calamity .
So but (for) Thamud , so they were made to die/destroyed with a wind blowing/frosty (and) violent .
And but (for) Aad , so they were made to die/destroyed by a violent blowing/frosty wind .
He manipulated/subjugated it on them seven nights and eight days ominously/severing goodness (uprooting), so you see the nation in it lying flat/mad, as if they are palm tree's fallen/destroyed ends.
So do you see for them from a remainder/remnant?
And Pharaoh came, and who (is) before him, and the overturned/destroyed cities with the sin .
So they disobeyed their Lord's messenger, so He punished them an increased spellbinding (devastating) punishment .
We (E) when the water became elevated (over flowed)/violent , We carried/lifted you in the ship/flowing .
To make/put it for you (as) a reminder, and comprehending/perceiving ears accept/understand it .
So when (it) was blown in the horn/bugle/instrument, one blow.
And the earth/Planet Earth and the mountains were carried/lifted , so they (B) were leveled/flattened one crunch/destruction .
So that day, the Resurrection/Event landed/happened .
And the sky/space split away/cut open , so it is (on) that day cracked/weak .
And the angels (are) on its boundaries/vastness , and that day eight carries/lifts your Lord's throne above them .
That day, you are being exhibited/displayed , not a hidden (thing) hides from you.
So but who was given/brought his book/judgment with his right (hand), so he says: "Take (here take this) read my Book/judgment ."
That I, I thought/assumed that I am receiving/meeting my account/calculation (punishment).
So he is in (an) acceptable/approved life/quality of life.
In an elevated/dignified treed garden/paradise.
Its fruit harvests (are) near.
Eat and drink pleasurable/wholesome/tasty because (of) what you advanced in the days/times, the past/expired .
And but who was given/brought his Book/judgment with his left (hand), so he says: "I wish I would have not been given my book/judgment ."
And I did not know what my account/calculation (is).
Oh,. if only it was the end/death.
My property/possession/wealth did not enrich/suffice (help) from (for) me.
My authority/power perished from me.
Take/punish him , so chain/tie him.
Then (in) the Hell roast/burn him .
Then in a chain its measure (length is) seventy arm/ells/cubit , so enter/pass/thread/(tie) him.
That he truly was not believing with (in) God, the great.
And nor urges/insights/influences on feeding the poorest of poor/poor oppressed.
So here, here (a) concerned (relative/friend) is not for him the day/today.
And nor food except from ghesleen (could be Hell's occupants' flesh, skin and blood) .
None eat it except the mistaken/erroneous .
So I do not swear/make oath with what you see .
And what you do not see .
That it truly is an honoured/noble messenger's word/saying (E) .
And it is not with a poet's word/saying , little (is) what you believe.
And nor with a fortune teller's/altar priests word/saying , little (is) what you mention/remember .
Descent from the creations all together's/(universe's) Lord.
And if (the messenger) made false statements on Us (on Our behalf) some (of) the sayings/beliefs .
We would have punished/taken from him by the right (hand).
Then We would have severed/cut off from him the aorta/heart's main artery.
So (there) is not from anyone from you preventing/hindering from (for) him.
And that it truly is a reminder for the fearing and obeying.
And We (E), We know (E) that (E) from you (are) liars/deniers/falsifiers.
And that it truly is grief/sadness (E) , on the disbelievers.
And that it truly is true/real (E) the assurance/certainty.
So praise/glorify with your Lord's name the great. 
(An) asker/questioner asked/questioned with (about) a falling/landing torture.
To the disbelievers (there) is not for it (a) repeller/pusher.
From God, (owner) of the methods of ascent .
The angels and the Soul/Spirit ascend/climb to Him in a day/time its value/estimation/ measure was/is fifty thousand years.
So be patient, beautiful/graceful patience.
That they truly, they see/understand it a distant/far.
And We see/understand it near/close.
A day/time the sky/space becomes as the dead's puss/melted metal .
And the mountains become like the wool/dyed wool.
And nor (a) concerned (relative/friend) asks/questions (about a) concerned (relative/friend).
They make them see/understand; the criminal/sinner wishes/loves if he ransoms/compensates (sacrifices) with his sons from that day's torture (to save himself).
And his wife/companion/friend and his brother.
And his closest tribe/relations which shelters him/gives him refuge.
And whom (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all/all together, then (He) saves/rescues him.
No, but that it is blazing/flaming .
Pulling away/removing to the extremities/outer layer of skin .
It calls who gave his back and turned away .
And gathered/collected , so he comprehended/accepted .
That truly the human/mankind was created worrisome/frightened .
If the bad/evil/harm touched him, (he is) worrying/grievous and impatient.
And if the goodness touched him, (he is) often preventing/prohibiting .
Except the praying.
Those who (are) on their prayers continuing/lasting.
And those who in their properties/possessions (is) a known right/share .
For the asker/beggar and the deprived.
And those who believe/confirm with the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day .
And those whom they are from their Lord's torture, are afraid/guarding/cautious .
That truly their Lord's torture (is) not trusted/safe .
And those who to their genital parts (they are) protecting/guarding .
Except on (for) their spouses and what their rights owned/possessed (i.e.: care-givers of the sick, elderly and disabled under contract), so then they are not blameworthy/blamed.
So who desired/wished beyond that, so those, they are the transgressors/violators .
And those who, to their deposits/securities and their promise/contracts , (they are) protecting/observing .
And those who, they are with their testimonies (they are) taking care of .
And those who, they are on their prayers (they are) protecting/observing .
Those are in treed gardens/paradises honoured.
So why (is it) those who disbelieved (are) coming, rushing in fear towards/in front of you ?
Groups of people/relations from the right (side), and from the left (side).
Does every/each human from them wish/covet that (E) he enters a treed garden/paradise (of) comfort and ease ?
No but that We created them from what they know .
So I do not swear/make oath with the sun rises'/easts' , and the sunsets'/wests' Lord, that We are capable/able (E) .
On that (E) We exchange/replace better than them, and We are not with being raced/preceded .
So leave them plunge into/engage in conversation and play/amuse until they meet/find their day/time which they are being promised .
A day/time they appear/emerge from the graves quickening/rushing as if they are to monuments/slaughter places running/hurrying .
Their eyesights/understanding (are) humble/submissive , humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses them ,that (is) the day/time which they were being promised. 
That We sent Noah to his nation, that (E) warn/give notice (to) your nation from before that (E) a painful torture comes to them.
He said: "My nation, that I am for you a clear/evident warner/giver of notice."
That (E) worship God and fear and obey Him, and obey me.
He forgives for you from your crimes, and He delays you to a named/identified (specified) term/time, that truly God's term/time if (it) came (it) does not be delayed, if you were knowing .
He said: "My Lord, that I , I called my nation at night/nightly and day time."
So my call did not increase them except escape/fleeing .
And that I, whenever I called them (for You) to forgive for them, they made/put their fingers in their ears, and they covered/darkened themselves (with) their clothes/garments , and they persisted/insisted, and they became arrogant, arrogantly.
Then, that I, I called them publicly .
Then, that I, I declared/publicized for them, and I confided for them secretly.
So I said: 'Ask for forgiveness (from) your Lord, that He truly was/is a forgiver/often, forgiving.'
'He sends the sky/space on you flowing/pouring abundantly.'
'And He extends/spreads you with properties/possessions , and sons and daughters, and He makes/puts for you treed gardens/paradises, and He makes/puts for you rivers/waterways.'
'Why for you, you do not hope/expect for God a glory/respect ?'
'And He had created you (in) parallels/varieties/stages .'
'Do you not see, understand how God created seven skies/space(s) (in) stages/layers/plates ?'
'And He made/put the moon in them (as) a light, and He made/put the sun (as) a lamp .'
'And God sprouted/grew you from the earth/Planet Earth (as) plants/growth.'
Then He returns/repeats you in it, and He brings you out bringing out .'"
'And God made/put for you the earth/Planet Earth outstretched/widened .'
To pass/thread from it wide mountain paths roads/paths ."'
Noah said: "My Lord, that they truly disobeyed me, and they followed who his properties/possessions , and his children/child did not increase him except loss ."
And they cheated/deceived , a great/magnified cheatery/deceit .
And they said: "Do not leave (E) your gods, and do not leave (E) Waddan (could be an idol god), and nor Sowa'an (a female idol god, worshipped by Hothail tribe of Arabs in pre-Islam), and nor Yaghootha (an idol god), and Yaooka (an idol god), and Nasran (an idol god)."
And they had misguided many, and (my Lord), do not increase the unjust/oppressive except misguidance.
From what their sins/wrongs they were drowned/sunken, so they were made to enter fire , so they did not find for them from other than God victoriors/saviors .
And Noah said: "My Lord, do not leave on the earth/Planet Earth from the disbelievers a resident/inhabitant."
That You, if You leave them, they misguide Your worshippers/servants , and they do not give birth except (to a) debaucher/corrupter, disbeliever.
My Lord forgive for me and to my parents, and to who entered my house/home believing, and to the believers (M), and the believers (F), and do not increase the unjust/oppressive except destruction/ruin
Say: (It) was inspired/transmitted to me that it is a group (  -  ) from the Jinn heard/ listened, so they said: 'We (E) heard/listened (to) an astonishing/amazing/marvelous Koran .'"
'It guides to the correct/right guidance, so we believed with it, and we will never/not share/make partners with our Lord anyone.'
'And that He truly is our Lord, high, mighty exalted and dignified (owner of) majestic greatness, (He) did not take a wife/companion/friend and nor a child/children.'
'And that he, our ignorant/stupid/foolish was saying on (about) God excess of the limit .'
'And that we, we thought/assumed that (E) the human/mankind and the Jinns will never/not say on (about) God lies/denials/falsifications .'
'And that it was men from the human/mankind they seek protection with men from the Jinns , so they increased them oppression/sin/foolishness .'
'And that they thought/assumed as/like you thought/assumed , that (E) God will never/not send/resurrect/revive anyone.'
'And that we, we touched the sky/space, so we found it filled (with) strong guards, and all lights from a fire source/stars/planets (shooting stars) .'
'And that we, we were sitting/remaining (in position) from it (in) seats/sitting places (positions) for the hearing/listening, so who hears/listens now finds for him a light from a fire source/star/flame (shooting star) watching/observing (ambushing) (him).'
'And that we, we do not know is (it) bad/evil/harmful (is) wanted/intended with who (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, or their Lord wanted/intended correct/right guidance with (for) them .'
'And that we from us (are) the correct/righteous, and from us (are) other than that, we were stages/layers fragments/pieces.'
'And that we, we thought/assumed that (E) we will never/not disable/frustrate God in the earth/Planet Earth, and we will never/not disable/frustrate Him (by) escaping/fleeing .'
'And that we, when we heard/listened (to) the guidance, we believed with (in) it, so who believes with (in) his Lord, so (he) does not fear reduction/injustice , and nor oppression/burden .'
'And that we, from us (are) the Moslems/submitters , and from us (are) the deviators/ hardened , so who submitted/surrendered , so those searched/pursued correct/right guidance.'
'And but the deviators/hardened , so they were/are to/for Hell fire wood/fuel .'
'And that if they became straight/direct on the way/path , we would have given them drink (from) water plentifully/abundantly.'
'To test them in it, and who opposes/turns away from his Lord's reminder , He enters/passes him a severe torture.'
'And that (E) the mosques (are) to God, so do not call anyone with God.'
'And that he when God's worshipper/servant stood/started calling Him, they were about to/almost to be interlocked/plenty on (with) him .'
Say: "Truly I call my Lord, and I do not share/make partners with Him anyone."
Say: "That I do not own/possess harm, and nor correct/right guidance for you."
Say: "That I, anyone will never/not protect/defend me from God, and I will never/not find from other than Him a shelter/refuge."
Except an information/communication from God and His messenger, so who disobeys God and His messenger, so then Hell's fire (is) for him, immortally/eternally in it (for) ever (E).
Until when they saw/understood what they are being promised, so they will know who (is) a weaker victorior/savior and less numerous.
Say: "I do not know what you are being promised, (if it) is nearer/closer or my Lord makes/puts for it (extended) time."
Knower (of) the unseen/absent , so He does not reveal (to) anyone on His unseen/supernatural (secret) .
Except whom He accepted from a messenger so that He truly, He enters/passes from between his hands (present) and from behind him (past), watching/observing observation.
(It is for God) to know that (E) they had communicated/informed their Lord's messages, and He surrounded/enveloped with what (is) at them, and He counted/controlled every thing numerous. 
You, you the hiding/wrapped in clothes.
Stand the night except little .
Its half/middle or reduce/decrease from it little .
Or increase on it, and read or recite slowly, distinctly and clearly the Koran, slow distinct and clear reading or recitation .
That We, We will throw (a) heavy saying/word/declaration on you.
That truly the night's first hours it is stronger pressure and more just (in) a saying/word/declaration .
That truly for you in the daytime (is) long tending to the livelihood/sleeping and resting .
And remember/mention your Lord's name and devote your life to Him devotion of your life (to God).
The sun rises'/easts' and the sun set's/west's Lord, (there is) no God except Him, so take Him (as) a guardian/ally
And be patient on what they say, and desert/abandon them beautiful/graceful desertion/abandonment .
And leave Me and the liars/deniers/falsifiers (owners) of the blessing/goodness , and delay them (a) little .
That truly shackles and Hell (is) at Us.
And food of lumping in the throat and a painful torture.
A day/time the earth/Planet Earth and the mountains trembles and shakes , and the mountains were a heap of sand dumped sand or dust .
That We, We sent a messenger to you, a witness/testifier on you, as/like We sent a messenger to Pharaoh.
So Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We punished/took him (a) severe/detrimental punishing .
So how (do) you fear and obey (avoid), if you disbelieved (in) a day it makes the children/new borns white or gray haired (old)?
The sky/space is split/cleaved with (by) it, His promise was/is made/done.
That truly this (is) a reminder, so who wanted took/received a way/path to his Lord.
That truly your Lord knows that you, you stand/call (for) prayer nearer (than) from two-thirds (of) the night and its half/middle, and its third, and a group of people from those with you, and God predestines/evaluates the night and the daytime, He knew that you (will) not count/compute it so He forgave on you, so read what eased/became flexible (what you can) from the Koran, He knew that (E) sick/diseased will be from you, and others moving (traveling) in the land/Earth wishing/desiring from God's grace/favour/blessing, and others fighting in God's way/path , so read what eased/became flexible from it (what you can), and keep up the prayers, and give/bring the charity/purification, and lend/advance God a good/ beautifulloan/advance, and what you advance/produce for yourselves from goodness/ generosity you find it at God, it is better and greater (in) a reward , and ask God for forgiveness, that truly God (is) forgiving, merciful. 
You, you the wrapped/covered for warmth in a robe.
Stand , so warn/give notice.
And your Lord, so magnify/exalt/revere .
And your clothes/garments , so purify/clean .
And the paganism/idol worship/sin , so abandon.
And do not do a favour and remind of it doing much (repeatedly) .
And to your Lord, so be patient.
So if the horn/bugle/trumpet was blown in.
So that, that day (is) a difficult/distressing day/time.
On the disbelievers (it is)not easy .
Leave Me and whom I created alone.
And I made/put for him extended/spread possessions/property .
And sons and daughters present/testifying .
And I prepared for him preparation .
Then he wishes/covets that I increase.
No, but he was to Our verses/evidences stubborn/obstinate.
I will burden him (with) severity/hardship.
That he truly thought, and he evaluated/estimated .
So how he evaluated/estimated was killed (punished).
Then was killed (punished) how he evaluated/estimated.
Then he looked .
Then he frowned , and he frowned/became gloomy .
Then he gave his back and he became arrogant.
So he said: "That truly that (is) except magic/sorcery to be traced (followed/copied) ."
That truly that (is) except the human's word/opinion and belief .
I will roast/make him suffer Hell .
And what makes you know what Hell (is)?
(It) does not protect/have mercy , and nor it leaves.
Shrinking/dehydrating due to fire to the human/skin.
On it (are) nineteen.
And We did not make the fire's owners/company (guards) except angels, and We did not make their number/count except (as) a test to those who disbelieved, who were given/brought The Book (Jews and Christians) to be sure/certain, and (for) those who believed (to) increase faith/belief; and (for) those who weregiven The Book (Jews/Christians), and the believers do not become doubtful/suspicious, and (for) those whom in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease (doubt), and the disbelievers to say: "What (has) God wanted/intended with that (as) an example/proverb?" As/like that God misguides whom He wills/wants ,and He guides whom He wills/wants, and none know your Lord's soldiers/warriors except Him, and it is not except a reminder to the human.
No but and/by the moon.
And/by the night when it ended/passed.
And/by morning/day break when it appeared/lit/shined .
That it truly is one (E) (of) the greatest .
A warning/notice to the human.
For who from you wanted that to advance/precede or delay/lag behind.
Every/each self with what (it) earned/gained/acquired (is) accountable .
Except the right (side's) owners .
In treed gardens/paradises (are) asking/questioning each other.
About the criminals/sinners:
What made you enter/follow in Hell ?
They said: "We were not from praying."
And we were not feeding the poorest of poor/poor oppressed.
And we were engaging in conversation with the engaging in conversation .
And we were denying with the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day .
Until the assurance/certainty (death) came to us.
So the mediators' mediation does not benefit them.
So what (is) for them (they are) from the reminder opposing/objecting .
As if they are frightened/running away donkeys.
It escaped/fled from cruelty/a lion .
But every/each human from them wants/intends that he be given/brought written sheets/pages (books/scriptures) spread/publicized .
No but they do not fear the end (other life).
No, but that it (the Koran) truly is a reminder.
So who wanted/intended remembered it .
And they do not mention/remember except that God wills/wants , He is worthy/relation (owner of) the fear and obedience, and (He is) worthy/relation (owner of) the forgiveness. 
I do not swear/make oath with the Resurrection Day
And nor I swear/make oath with the self , the often blaming/reprimanding.
Does the human/mankind think/suppose that We (will) not gather/unite his bones?
Yes/certainly We are capable/able on that (E) We straighten (recreate) his fingertip (finger print) .
Rather the human/mankind wants to debauch/corrupt in front of him.
He asks/questions: "When (is) the Resurrection Day?"
So if/when the eye sight/vision glared/gleamed/confused and astonished .
And the moon punctured/eclipsed .
And the sun and the moon were gathered/collected.
The human/mankind that day says: "Where (is) the escape/escape to (shelter)?"
No but (there is) no shelter .
To your Lord that day (is) the settlement .
The human/mankind (will) be informed that day with what he advanced/preceded and he delayed.
Rather the human/mankind (is) on him self (an) evidence/witness .
And even if he threw (gave) his apologies/excuses.
Do not move with it your tongue to hurry/hasten/rush with it.
That truly on Us (is) gathering/accumulating it , and its reading/recitation .
So when/if We read it, so follow its reading/recitation .
Then that truly on Us (is) its clarification/explanation.
No, but you love/like the worldly life/present.
And you leave the end (other life).
Faces/fronts, that day (are) beautiful and good (bright/blooming).
To its Lord looking .
And faces/fronts, that day (are) frowning/gloomy .
(They) think/suppose that a disaster/calamity will be made/done with it.
No, but when/if the collar bones/verge of death reached.
And (it) was said: "Who (is) ascended/elevated (being saved)?"
And (he) thought/assumed that it is the separation.
And the shin/leg coiled/wrapped with the shin/leg.
To your Lord (on) that day (is) the drive (destination).
So he did not give charity and nor he prayed.
And but lied/denied and turned away.
Then he went to his people walking stretched with his arms moving in a conceited manner (marching arrogantly).
Woe/warning/threat (Hell) for you, so woe/warning/threat (Hell for you).
Then woe/warning/threat (Hell) for you, so woe/warning/threat (Hell for you).
Does the human/mankind think/suppose that (E) he be left unattended to/disregarded (uncounted with)?
Did he not be a drop/male's or female's secretion from sperm/semen , semen being ejaculated/ discharged ?
Then (he) was/became a blood clot , so He created (it), so He straightened/perfected (it).
So He made/created from it the couples/pairs , the male and the female.
Is not that with capable/able on that He revives/makes alive the deads? 
Did (it) come on the human/mankind (a) period of time from the long time he was not a mentioned/remembered thing?
That We, We created the human/mankind from a drop/male's or female's secretion mixtures (of secretions), We test him, so We made/created him hearing/listening, seeing/knowing .
That We, We guided him the way/path , either (he is) thankful/grateful and either (an insistent) disbeliever.
That We prepared/made ready for the disbelievers chains/successions, and leather or iron collars or handcuffs and blazing/inflaming (punishment).
That truly the righteous/charitable drink from a cup its mixture/blend was camphor .
A water well/spring God's worshippers/slaves drink by it, they cause it to flow bursting/flowing .
They fulfill/complete with the vow/duty (on oneself) , and they fear a day/time its evil/harm was spread and scattered .
And they feed the food on (inspite of) its love/like (to it to) a poorest of poor/poor oppressed and an orphan ,and a captive/prisoner.
(They say): "Truly we feed you for God's sake , we do not want from you a reward/reimbursement ,and nor thankfulness/gratefulness.
We (E), fear from our Lord a severe (gloomy) difficult/evil day/time."
So God protected/preserved them (from) that the day's/time's bad/evil/harm, and He made them meet/find beauty and goodness and delight/happiness.
And He rewarded/reimbursed them because (of) what they were patient (by) treed gardens/paradises and silk.
Resting/reclining in it on the luxurious beds/couches, they do not see in it sun and nor severe cold/anger.
And its shades/shadows (are) near on them, and its fruit harvests was manipulated/dangled low dangling/manipulating.
And (they are) being circled around on them with drinking cups from silver and cups (that) were/are clear glass/mirrors .
Clear glass/mirrors from silver, they predestined/evaluated it predestination/evaluation.
And they be given drink in it (in) a cup its mixture/blend was ginger/wine.
A water spring/well in it, it is named Salsbeelan/fresh, smooth and pleasant water fountain.
And immortal/eternal children/new borns circle/walk around them, if you saw/understood them you thought/supposed them (that) they (are) scattered/sprinkled pearls.
And if you saw/understood, then you saw/understood comfort and ease/blessing and a great ownership/kingdom .
Their tops (covers them) clothes/garments (from) green sarcenet (certain type of silk or brocade) and brocade (silk and gold fabric), and they were bejeweled/ornamented (with) bracelets from silver, and their Lord gave/made them drink a pure/clear drink.
That truly that was for you a reward/reimbursement , and your striving/endeavor was/is thanked.
That We, We descended on you the Koran descent.
So be patient for your Lord's judgment/rule, and do not obey a sinner/criminal (insistent) disbeliever from them.
And remember/mention your Lord (at) daybreaks/early mornings and (at) evening to sunset .
And from the night, so prostrate to Him, and praise/glorify Him at night/nightly long.
That truly those love/like the worldly life/present, and they leave behind them a heavy day/time.
We, We created them and We strengthened/supported their bone structure/ties and joints/(strengths) , and if We willed/wanted/intended We exchanged/replaced their equivalent (by) an exchange/replacement .
That truly this (is) a reminder, so who wanted took/received a way/path to his Lord.
And you do not will/want except that (E) God wills/wants/intends, that truly God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious.
He enters whom He wills/wants in His mercy, and the unjust/oppressive, He prepared for them a painful torture. 
And/by the messengers/sent/angles (F) , successively/sand dunes/elevated points .
So the stormy/turbulent winds , violently/turbulently.
And/by the spreading/extending/winds (for clouds) , spreading out/extending.
So the separated clouds/separators of right and wrong , separating.
So the throwing/throwing away a reminder/remembrance (delivering messages).
An excuse/fault or sins or (a) warning/notice.
That truly what you are being promised (is) happening (E) .
So when/if the stars/planets were eliminated/effaced .
And when/if the sky/space opened/split open .
And when/if the mountains were uprooted and dispersed/exploded .
And when/if the messengers were appointed a time.
To which day/time it was delayed.
To the Judgment Day/Separation Day/Resurrection Day .
And what makes you know what the Judgment Day/Separation Day/Resurrection Day (is)?
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers .
Did We not destroy the first/beginners?
Then We make them followed (by) the lasts/others .
As/like that We make/do with the criminals/sinners.
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
Did We not create you from despised/humiliated (discarded) water?
So We made/put it in a highly positioned/established settlement/affixation .
To a known predestiny/estimation .
So We evaluated and measured precisely, so blessed/praised (are) the capable/able .
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
Did We not make the earth/Planet Earth encompassing/containing internally and externally ?
Alive and deads.
And We made/put in it anchors/mountains high/towering , and We gave you drink (from) very sweet/fresh water.
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
Leave/go/set out to what you were with it lying/denying/falsifying.
Leave/go/set out to shade of three branches/three off shoots .
Not shading and nor enriches/suffices (protects) from the flame of a smokeless fire.
That it truly throws with sparks as (big) as the castle/palace .
As though it (is) camels yellow .
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
That (is) a day/time they do not speak.
And nor (it) be permitted/allowed for them so (that) they apologize/excuse themselves .
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
That (is) the Judgment Day/Separation Day/Resurrection Day We gathered/collected you and the first/beginners.
So if (there) was for you (a) plot/conspiracy , so plot/conspire against Me .
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
That truly the fearing and obeying (are) in shades and water springs/wells.
And fruits from what they desire/crave .
Eat and drink pleasurable/wholesome because (of) what you were making/doing .
That truly like that We reimburse the good doers.
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
Eat and enjoy little that you truly are criminals/sinners.
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
And when/if (it) was said to them: "Bow ." They do not bow .
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
So with which information/speech after it (do) they believe (in it)? 
About what (do) they ask/question each other?
About the information/news the great.
Which they are in it differing/disagreeing .
No, but they will know.
Then no but they will know.
Did We not make the earth/Planet Earth prepared/spread ?
And the mountains (as) stakes/hooks (anchors) .
And We created you pairs/couples/kinds .
And We made your sleep rest/tranquil .
And We made the night a cover .
And We made the daytime (for) livelihood/sustenance .
And We built/constructed above you seven strong.
And We made a lamp glowing/illuminating .
And We descended from the raining clouds strongly flowing/pouring water.
To bring out with it seeds/grains and plants/growth.
And interwoven/encircled treed gardens/paradises.
That truly the Judgment Day/Separation Day/Resurrection Day was an appointed time .
A day/time the horn/bugle/instrument be blown in, so you come (in) groups/crowds
And the sky/space was opened, so it was/became doors/entrances.
And the mountains were made to move , so it was/became a mirage.
That truly Hell was/is an observatory/ambuscade .
For the tyrants a return.
Remaining/waiting in it long periods of time/centuries .
They do not taste/experience in it cold/cool and nor a drink .
Except hot water/sweat and decayed/rotten .
A suiting/fitting reimbursement .
That, they truly were not hoping/expecting counting/calculation .
And they lied/denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences lying/denying/falsifying.
And every thing We counted/computed it (in) a Book/judgment .
So taste/experience, so We will never/not increase you except torture.
That truly to the fearing and obeying (is) a success/triumph .
Fenced gardens and grapes .
And full grown breasts and same age/not aging .
And a cup filled to the rim .
They do not hear/listen in it nonsense/senseless talk and nor lying .
Reimbursement from your Lord a gift/grant account .
The skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's and what (is) between them (B)'s Lord, the merciful, they do not own/possess from Him an address/conversation (they can not talk to Him).
A day/time the Soul/Spirit and the angels stand (in) a row/arranged , they do not speak/talk ,except who the merciful permitted/allowed for him, and he said right/correct.
That (is) the day/time, the real/true/just , so who willed/wanted took/received to his Lord a return.
We (E), We warned/gave you notice of (a) near/close torture, a day/time the human/man looks (to) what his two hands advanced/undertook , and the disbeliever says: "Oh, if only I was dust/earth." 
And/by the strangers/life extractors , exaggerating/absorbing (violently) .
And/by the active/pullers , actively/pulling .
And/by the ships/stars/fast (could be angels), tending to the livelihood/floating .
So the racing/surpassing/preceding, racing/surpassing/preceding.
So the regulators/arrangers/planners (of) a matter/affair/order/command.
A day/time the first blow of the horn trembles and shakes/agitates .
The followed closely behind follows it.
Hearts (on) that day (are) palpitating/pounding .
Its eyesight/understanding (is) humble/submissive .
They say: "Are we returning (E) in the first creation ?"
Is (it that) if we were decayed/decomposed bones.
They said: "That is then a loosing repetition ."
So but it is one deterrent/cry to drive out .
So then they are at the Earth's surface .
Did Moses' information/speech come to you?
When His Lord called him at the Valley the Holy/Sanctified Tuwan/concealed/folded within :
Go to Pharaoh, that he truly exceeded the limit/tyrannized .
So say: 'Is there for you that (E) you purify/become righteous ?'
'And I guide you to your Lord so you fear.'
So he showed him/made him understand the verse/evidence/sign, the greatest/biggest .
So he denied/falsified , and he disobeyed.
Then he gave his back/ended/passed hastening .
So he gathered, so he called.
So he said: "I am your lord the highest/mightiest ."
So God punished/took him (the) severe exemplary punishment (of) the end (other life) and the first/beginning.
That truly in that (is) an example/warning (E) to who fears.
Are you (a) stronger creation or the sky/space (which) He built/constructed it?
He raised its height/thickness, so He straightened it.
And He darkened its night, and He brought out its day break .
And the earth/Planet Earth after that He blew and stretched/spread it.
He brought out from it its water and its pasture.
And the mountains , He anchored it/fixed it firmly.
Enjoyment for you and for your camels/livestock.
So if/when the Calamity/Greatest Disaster/Resurrection Day the greatest came.
A day/time the human/mankind remembers/recites what he strived/endeavored .
And the Hell was made to emerge to who sees/understands.
So but who exceeded the limit/tyrannized/became arrogant.
And preferred/chose the life the present/worldly life.
So then the Hell , it is the shelter/refuge.
And but who feared his Lord's position/status and he forbid/prevented the self from the self attraction for desire .
So then the Paradise/treed garden, it is the shelter/refuge.
They ask/question you about the Hour/Resurrection when (is) its landing ?
In what you are from mentioning/remembering it (what do you know about it or its time)?
To your Lord (is) its ultimate/absolute end.
Truly/but you are a warner/giver of notice (to) who fears it.
As if they are, a day/time they see it, they did not stay/remain/wait (in their graves) except an evening or its daybreak/forenoon  
He frowned/knit or contracted his brows and he turned away .
That (E) the blind (man) came to him.
And what makes you know/informs you maybe/perhaps he, he purifies/corrects (himself).
Or He mentions/remembers , so the remembrance/reminder benefits him .
But/as for who availed/sufficed (rejected) .
So you are for him paying attention/being concerned with .
And it (is) not on you that he not purifies/corrects (himself).
And but/as for who came to you striving/hastening .
And he fears.
So you are from him distracted/preoccupied .
No, but that it truly is a reminder.
So who wanted/willed remembered/mentioned Him .
In honoured written pages/sheets (scriptures) .
Raised, purified .
By messengers'/scribes'/writers' hands.
Honoured/generous , righteous/obedient .
Killed ('woe') the human/mankind what made him more disbelieving (an expression)?
From what thing He created him?
From a drop/male's or female's secretion He created him, so He predestined/evaluated/estimated him.
Then (to) the road/path He eased him.
Then He made him die, so He caused him to be buried in a grave .
Then when/if He willed/wanted/intended He revived/resurrected him .
No/but he did not (E) accomplish/execute what He ordered/commanded him.
So the human/mankind should look/watch to his food.
We (E), We poured/flowed the water pouring/flowing.
Then We split/cracked the earth/Planet Earth splitting/cracking .
So We sprouted/grew in it seeds/grains.
And grapes and all trees and vegetation when it regrows for animal consumption i.e.) clover.
And olives and palm trees.
And dense/luxurious fenced gardens.
And fruits and grass/hay/herbs.
Enjoyment for you and for your camels/livestock.
So when the Deafening Noise/Resurrection Day came.
A day/time the human/man escapes/flees from his brother.
And his mother, and his father.
And his wife/companion/friend, and his sons and daughters.
To every/each human/man from them (on) that day (is) a matter/affair (that) suffices him (worries and keeps him busy).
Faces/fronts (on) that day, lit and shining .
Laughing, cheerful/rejoiced .
And faces/fronts (on) that day, on it (is) dust.
Smoke/dust burdens/depresses/oppresses it.
Those, they are the disbelievers, the debauchers/corrupters. 
When/if the sun's light rolled/rotated .
And when/if the stars/planets became dispersed/dulled .
And when/if the mountains were made to move .
And when/if the female camels and other livestock over ten months pregnant were abandoned/left unsupervised (miscarried) .
And when/if the wild beasts were gathered.
And when/if the seas/oceans filled and over flowed.
And when/if the selves were made in pairs/couples .
And when/if the buried alive was asked/questioned:
With (because of) which crime it was killed?
And when/if the written pages (scriptures) were spread/publicized .
And when/if the sky/space was skimmed/scraped off/uncovered.
And when/if the Hell was ignited/blazed .
And when/if the Paradise was advanced/brought near.
A self knew what it presented/brought.
So I do not swear/make oath by the planets .
The flowing/orbiting , the orbiting/sweeping planets/stars.
And the night when/if (it) passed/lightened .
And the morning/daybreak when/if (it) breathed in or out (began).
That it truly is an honored/generous messenger's word/statement/declaration (E).
(Owner) of power at (owner) of the throne highly positioned/distinguished .
Obeyed there at the same time or place, faithful/loyal .
And your companion/friend is not with mad/insane.
And he/He had seen/understood him/Him at the horizon/direction, the clear/evident .
And he is not on the unseen/supernatural (future) with withholding/clinging .
And it is not with a cursed/expelled devil's saying/statement .
So where (do) you go ?
That truly it is except a reminder to the creations all together/(universes).
To who willed/wanted from you that (E) to be straight/direct.
And you do not want/will/intend except that (E) (if) God wants/wills/intends, the creations all together's/(universe's) Lord.
When/if the sky/space split/cracked/cleaved.
And when/if the stars/planets scattered/spread .
And when/if the seas/oceans burst/over flowed.
And when/if the graves/burial places are scattered/over thrown .
A self knew what it advanced/preceded and delayed.
You, you the human/mankind, what has deceived/tempted you with (from) your Lord, the honoured/generous ?
Who created you, so He straightened you, so He balanced/adjusted you .
In any shape/picture what He willed/intended He assembled/composed you .
No but, rather you lie/deny/falsify with the religion.
And that truly (We are) on you protectors/observers (E) .
Honoured/generous , writing/ordering .
They (the angels) know what you make/do .
That truly the righteous/charitable (are) in (E) blessing/goodness .
And that truly the debauchers/corrupters (are) in (E) Hell .
They roast/suffer (from) it (in) the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day .
And they are not from it with (being) absent/hidden .
And what made you know/informed you what (is) the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day ?
Then what made you know/informed you what the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day (is)?
A day/time a self does not own/possess to a self a thing, and the matter/affair/order/command (on) that day (is) to God.
Calamity/scandal to the ones giving insufficient or deficient measures .
Those who if they took by measure or weight for themselves on (from) the people, they fulfill/complete (the measure or weight).
And if they measured/weighed for them or they weighed/measured for them , they reduce/decrease (cheat).
Do those not think/assume that they are being resurrected/revived?
To a great day/time?
A day/time the people stand to the creations all together's/(universes') Lord.
No but that truly the debauchers'/corrupters' Book/judgment (is) in (E) Sijjin .
And what made you know/informed you what (is) Sijjin ?
A written/branded/inscribed Book .
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers.
Those who lie/deny/falsify with the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day .
And none lies/denies/falsifiers with it except every/each transgressor/violator , sinner/criminal.
When/if Our verses/evidences are read/recited on him he said: "The first's/beginner's myths/baseless stories ."
No but, rather (it) dominated/overwhelmed on their hearts/minds , what they were gaining/acquiring .
No but, that they truly are from their Lord (on) that day being prevented (E).
Then that they truly are entering into the fire/roasting (E) the Hell .
Then (it) will be said: "That (is) what you were with it lying/denying/falsifying."
No but, that truly the righteous'/charitable' Book/judgment (is) in (E) Eley'yeen/height/elevation.
And what made you know/informed you what (is) Eley'yoon/highest places ?
A written/branded/inscribed Book .
The neared/closer witness it.
That truly the righteous/charitable (are) in (E) blessing/goodness .
On the luxurious beds/couches they look/watch .
You know in their faces/fronts the blessing's/goodness' beauty and goodness (brightness).
They are being given water/drink from sealed/completed pure nectar .
Its end/conclusion (is) musk/fragrance, and in (for) that so the competitors/rivals should compete/rival.
And its mixture/blend (is) from paradises' valuable water.
A water spring/well, the neared/closer drink by (near) it .
That truly those who committed crimes/sins were laughing/wondering from (about) those who believed.
And when/if they passed by them, they signal/wink to each other.
And when/if they returned to their people/family , they returned enjoying/humorous .
And when/if they saw them they said: "That truly, those are misguided (E)."
And they were not sent on them protecting/observing .
So the day/today those who believed are laughing/wondering from (about) the disbelievers.
On the luxurious beds/couches they (are) looking/watching .
Did the disbelievers become rewarded/replaced what they were making/doing ? 
When/if the sky/space split/cracked .
And listened/heard (obeyed) to its Lord, and became certain/fact/deserved .
And when/if the earth/Planet Earth was extended/spread.
And it threw what (is) in it, and became free.
And listened/heard (obeyed) to its Lord and became certain/fact/deserved .
You, you the human/mankind, that you truly are exerting/labouring/toiling to your Lord exertion/labour/toil, so you (are) receiving/meeting Him .
So but who was given/brought his Book/judgment with his right (hand).
So he will be counted/calculated (with an) easy account/calculation .
And he returns to his family/people delighted/happy.
And but who was given/brought his Book/judgment behind his back .
So he will call (for) destruction and grief .
And he suffers/burns blazing/inflaming (punishment).
That he truly was in his family/people delighted/happy.
That he truly thought/assumed that (E) he will never/not return.
Yes/certainly, that truly his Lord was seeing/knowing with (of) him.
So I do not swear/make oath with the twilight .
And the night, and what carried/gathered/loaded.
And the moon when/if it organized/evened/gathered .
You will ride/embark (E) a stage/layer/cover from/of/on a stage/layer/cover (they move from one state to another i.e. birth to death).
So why (is it) for them, they do not believe?
And when/if the Koran is read on them they, they do not prostrate?
But those who disbelieved they lie/deny/falsify.
And God (is) more knowing with what they comprehend/perceive/accept .
So announce good news to them with (of) a painful torture.
Except those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them (is) a reward not obligated/interrupted
And/by the sky/space that of the constellations .
And/by the Day the Promised/Resurrection Day.
And/by a witness/testifier and a witnessed (against).
The geological rift's-fault line's owners/company/friends were killed.
The fire , that of the fuel.
When they are on it sitting/remaining.
And they are on what they are making/doing with (to) the believers witnessing/testifying.
And they did not revenge/punish from them except (because) that (E) they believe with (in) God, the glorious/mighty , the praiseworthy/commendable.
Who for Him (is) the skies'/space's and the earth's/Planet Earth's ownership/kingdom , and God (is) on every thing witnessing .
That truly those who tortured/betrayed/allured the believers (M) and the believers (F), then they did not repent, so for them (is) Hell's torture, and for them (is) the burning's torture.
That truly those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them (are) treed gardens/paradises the rivers/waterways flow from below it, that is the winning/success , the great .
That truly your Lord's violent attack/destruction (is) strong (E) (severe).
That He truly creates/initiates , and returns/repeats .
And He is the forgiving, the loving/affectionate.
(Owner) of the throne , the most glorious/exacted .
Maker/doer to what He wills/wants/intends.
Did the soldiers'/warriors' information/news come to you?
Pharaoh and Thamud .
But those who disbelieved (are) in lying/denial/falsification.
And God is from behind them surrounding/comprehending .
But it is a glorious/exalted Koran .
In a protected/guarded tablet/sheet
And/by the sky/space, and/by the Night Comer/star (Morning Star).
And what made you know/informed you what the Night Comer/star (Morning Star is)?
The star/planet, the lit/penetrating .
That truly every/each self (is) except on it a protector/safe keeper .
So the human/mankind should look/see from what he was created.
He was created from water pouring/flowing forcefully.
It emerges/appears from between the spine and the rib bones.
That He truly (is) on returning him capable/able (E) .
A day/time the secrets/intentions be tested.
So (there is) no strength/power, and nor victorior/savior for him.
And the sky/space that of the rain after rain/benefit .
And the earth/Planet Earth that of the split/separation/geological rift-fault line .
That it truly is a word/statement (of) judgment/partition (decisive).
And it is not with (of) the joke/fun .
That they truly plot/conspire a plot/conspiracy .
And I plot/conspire a plot/conspiracy .
So delay/give time (to) the disbelievers, delay them/give them time slowly/gently.
Praise/glorify your Lord's name the highest/mightiest .
Who created, so He straightened.
And who predestined/evaluated , so He guided.
And who brought out/made (to) emerge the pasture.
So He made/created it rotten/spoiled (thin and dry) green/red with blackness.
We will make you read, so do not forget.
Except what God willed/wanted/intended, that He truly knows the declared/publicized and what hides.
And We ease you to the ease/prosperity.
So remind if the remembrance/reminder benefited.
Who fears will remember/praise/glorify .
And the most miserable/unhappy avoids/distances himself from it.
Who roasts/suffers the fire , the greatest .
Then he does not die in it and nor live.
Who purified/corrected had succeeded/won.
And mentioned/remembered his Lord's name, so he prayed.
But you prefer/choose the life the present/worldly life.
And the end (other life is) better and more lasting (everlasting).
That truly that (is) in (E) the written pages (Books/Scriptures) the first/beginning.
Abraham's and Moses' written pages (Books/Scriptures).
Did the disaster's/pericardium's/Resurrection's information/news come to you ?
Faces/fronts (on) that day (are) humble/submissive .
Making/doing/working, fatigued/exhausted.
It roasts/suffers a hot fire .
Being given drink/being watered from (a) present/near water well/spring.
Food/feeding is not for them except from Dareigh/gland (excretion) .
(It) does not fatten (nourish), and nor enriches/suffices from starvation/hunger.
Faces/fronts (on) that day (are) comfortable and eased/happy/smooth .
Accepting/approving for its striving/endeavor .
In an elevated/dignified treed garden/paradise.
You do not hear/listen (to) nonsense/senseless talk in it.
In it (is a) flowing/running water well/spring .
In it (are) raised royal beds/sofas.
And laid/raised cups .
And lined/arranged small pillows/cushions.
And scattered/distributed carpets/rugs.
Do they not look/wonder about to the camels how it was created?
And to the sky/space how it was raised?
And to the mountains how it was erected and raised/affixed?
And to the earth/Planet Earth how it was outspread/surfaced ?
So remind, truly you are a reminder.
You are not on them with dominating/controlling.
Except who turned away and disbelieved.
So God tortures him the torture, the greatest .
That truly to Us (is) their return.
Then that truly on Us (is) their account/calculation.
And/by the dawn
And/by ten nights.
And/by the double/even number, and the odd/singular/uneven.
And/by the night when (it) goes/departs.
Is in that an oath to (those) of (E) a mind?
Did you not see/understand how your Lord made/did with Aad?
Iram that of the pillars/posts ?
Which was not created similar/equal to it in the countries/cities ?
And Thamud who pierced/penetrated the rock/rock terrain at the valley?
And Pharaoh that of the stakes/pegs/nails ?
Those who tyrannized/exceeded the limit in the countries/cities .
So they increased (made too much) in it the corruption .
So your Lord poured on them (the) torture's intensity/severity .
That truly your Lord (is) at the watch/observation/ambuscade (E) .
So but the human/mankind when as long as his Lord tested him, so he honoured him and He blessed/comforted and eased him , so he says: "My Lord honored me."
And but when as long as He tested him, so He tightened/strained on him His/his provision, so he says: "My Lord humiliated/disgraced/degraded me."
No but, you do not honour/be kind/generous (to) the orphan .
And nor you urge/insight/influence on feeding the poorest of poor/poor oppressed.
And you eat the inheritance accumulatively/collectively gluttony .
And you love/like the property/possession/wealth lovingly excessively .
No but, when/if the earth/Planet Earth was hammered down/crushed , crushingly/destroyingly ,crushingly/destroyingly .
And your Lord came and the angels (in) a row/arranged (after) a row/arranged.
And came (on) that day with Hell ; that day the human/mankind remembers/mentions , and from where (is) for him the remembrance/reminder?
He says: "Oh if only I advanced/presented/preceded for my life."
So (on) that day no one tortures His torture.
And no one ties/chains/affirms His tying/chaining (restraining).
You, you the self, the assured/tranquil .
Return to your Lord accepting/approving, accepted/approved.
So enter in (among) My worshippers/servants .
And enter My treed garden/paradise. 
I do not swear/make oath with that, the country/land .
And you are placed in/occupying (residing) at this , the country/land.
And a father and what he gave birth (to)/procreated.
We had created the human/mankind in hardship .
Does he think/suppose that no one is capable/over powering on (over) him?
He says: "I destroyed/wasted plenty property/possession/wealth."
Does he think/suppose that (E) no one sees him?
Did We not make/create for him two eyes?
And a tongue , and two lips?
And We guided him (to) the two paths/good or bad ?
So he did not rush/force (himself) into the high mountain path/road ?
And what made you know/informed you what the high mountain path/road (is) ?
Releasing/freeing a neck/person/slave.
Or feeding in a day/time of hunger/starvation/famine.
An orphan of a relation/near/close.
Or a poorest of poor/poor oppressed of poverty.
Then he was from those who believed and directed/commanded each other with the patience, and directed/commanded each other with the mercy/compassion .
Those are the blessings'/right's (side's/hand's) owners/friends/company.
And those who disbelieved with Our verses/evidences , they are the bad omen's/left side's owners/friends/company.
Stationary/residing fire (is) on them.
And/by the sun and its sunrise/day light .
And/by the moon when/if it followed it.
And/by the daytime when/if it shined/revealed it .
And/by the night when/if it covers/darkens it .
And/by the sky/space and who built/constructed it.
And/by the earth/Planet Earth and who spread and extended it .
And/by a self and who straightened it.
So He inspired/transmitted (to) it its debauchery/corruption, and its fear and obedience of God.
Who purified/corrected it had succeeded/won.
And who buried it/plotted against it (corrupted it) had failed/despaired .
Thamud had lied/denied/falsified with its own tyranny/excess of the limit .
When/if its most miserable/unhappy stirred up/urged .
So God's messenger said to them: "God's female camel, and its drink/drinking (water)."
So they denied him , so they wounded it/slaughtered it/made it infertile, so their Lord became angry/destroyed on them because of their crime, so He straightened it.
And He does not fear its end/turn (result).
And/by the night when/if it covers/darkens .
And/by the daytime when/if it uncovered/shined .
And/by what (who) created the male and the female.
That truly your striving/endeavor (is) separate/different (E) .
So but who gave/granted and feared and obeyed.
And gave charity/confirmed with the best/most beautiful .
So We will ease him to the ease/prosperity.
And but who was stingy/miser and sufficed/availed .
And lied/denied/falsified with the best/most beautiful .
So We will ease him to the difficulty/hardship .
And his property/possession/wealth does not enrich/suffice (replace) from him if he fell/was destroyed .
That truly on Us (is) the guidance (E).
And that truly for Us (is) the end (other life) (E), and the first/beginning.
And so I warned you/gave you notice (of) a fire blazing/burning/inflaming.
None roasts/suffers it except the most miserable/unhappy.
Who lied/denied/falsified and turned away.
And the most fearing and obeying will be made to avoid it/be distanced from it.
Who gives/brings his property/possession/wealth (and) purifies/corrects (himself).
And (there) is not to anyone at Him from a blessing/goodness to be rewarded/reimbursed .
Except wishing/desiring his Lord's the highest's/mightiest's/most dignified's face/front (path).
And he/He will/shall (E) accept/approve.
And/by the sunrise/daybreak .
And/by the night when/if it quietened/became covered .
Your Lord did not leave/desert you , and nor hate/hit (you) on the head.
And the end (other life) (E) (is) better for you than the first/beginning.
And your Lord will/shall (E) give/grant you , so you accept/approve .
Did He not find you an orphan , so he sheltered (you)?
And He found you misguided so He guided (you)?
And He found you having dependents/poor , so He enriched/satisfied (you)?
So as for the orphan , so do not humiliate/compel .
And as for the asker/questioner/beggar , so do not yell at/drive away .
And as for with your Lord's blessing/goodness , so tell/inform.
Did We not delight/expand your chest (innermost)?
And We raised from you your sin/load/burden .
Which weighed heavily (on)/burdened your back.
And We raised for you your memory/reputation .
So that truly with the difficulty/hardship (is) ease/flexibility.
That truly with the difficulty/hardship (is) ease/flexibility.
So when/if you finished/ended/completed , so work hard/fatigue.
And to your Lord, so wish/desire.
And/by the figs and the olives.
And/by Seneen Mountain.
And/by this the country/land/city , the faithful/secure .
We had (E) created the human/mankind in best chronometry/cartography (methods of calculating maps and charts)/straightness (formation).
Then We returned him (to) lowest/more lowly/more mean lowly/mean (lowliest) .
Except those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so for them (is) a not interrupted/weakened reward .
So what makes you lie/deny/falsify after with the religion?
Is God not with (the) most judicious (of) the judges/rulers?
Read by your Lord's name who created.
He created the human/mankind from blood clots/sperm .
Read and/by your Lord, the most honoured/generous .
Who taught/instructed by the pen/writing utensil.
He taught/instructed the human/mankind what he did not know.
No but that truly the human/mankind tyrannizes/exceeds the limit (E).
That (E) he saw/understood him(self), he enriched/sufficed (himself).
That truly to your Lord (is) the return.
Did you see/understand who forbids/prevents?
A worshipper/servant/slave when/if he prayed ?
Did you see/understand if he was on the guidance?
Or he ordered/commanded with the fear and obedience of God?
Did you see/understand if he lied/denied/falsified and he turned away?
Does he not know with that (E) God sees/understands?
No but if (E) he does not end/terminate/stop, We will pull and strike (E) by the forehead/forehead's hair.
A lying/denying/falsifying, sinning/erring/wronging forehead/forehead's hair.
So he should call his caller.
We will call the strong ones/patrol force/Elzabaneya angels.
No but do not obey him, and prostrate and near/approach (to Me).
We (E) descended it in the predestined/destiny night . 
And what made you know/informed you what the predestined/destiny night (is)?
The predestined/destiny night (is) better than one thousand month (lunar months).
The angels descend and the Soul/Spirit in it, by their Lord's permission/pardon from every matter/affair.
Security/peace it is until the dawn's ascent/rising .
Those who disbelieved from the Book's people and the sharers/takers of partners (with God) were not broken to pieces/separated until the evidence comes to them.
A messenger from God, he reads/recites/follows purified/cleaned written pages (scriptures) .
In it (are) straight/valuable Books .
And those who were given/brought the Book did not separate except from after what came to them (from) the evidence.
And they were not ordered/commanded except to worship God faithful/loyal/devoted to Him (in) the religion (as) submitters/Unifiers of God , and they keep up the prayers, and they give/bring the charity/purification , and that (is) the straight/valuable religion.
That truly those who disbelieved from the Book's people and the sharers/takers of partners (with God are) in Hell's fire immortally/eternally in it, those, they are the creation's worst.
That truly those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, those, they are the creation's best.
Their reimbursement (is) at their Lord, treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, immortally/eternally in it (for) ever (E), God accepted/approved on them, and they accepted/approved on Him, that (is) to who feared his Lord.
When/if the earth/Planet Earth shook/trembled its shaking/trembling/earthquake.
And the earth/Planet Earth brought out its loads/weights .
And the human/mankind said: "What (is) for it (what is wrong with it)?"
That day it tells/informs (about) its news/information/knowledge.
With that your Lord inspired/transmitted to it.
That day, the people proceed/arise separately to see their deeds.
So who makes/does a smallest particle of anything (smaller than an atom's) weight (of) good sees it.
And who makes/does a smallest particle of anything (smaller than an atom's) weight (of) bad/evil sees it. 
And/by the panting/changing colour , attacking forces/horses.

To Koreish's unification/familiarity .
Their unification/familiarization (with) the winter's and the summer's travel/journey .
So they should worship this, the House's/Home's Lord.
