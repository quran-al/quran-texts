Lord; the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
Thank you Lord, the Creator of the entire universe
You are the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful
We acknowledge You as the Master of the Day of Judgment
You (and no body else) are the One that we worship and You (and no one else) are the One that we ask for help
Guide us to the straight path
The path paved by those who received your blessings and not the ones who (deserved) your anger and lost (forever) in darkness .
ALM. 
This book [which in its entirety is <u>the</u> word of God] without any doubt, is the guidance for God-fearing people. 
[God fearing people are] Those Who believe in the existence of the unseen [beings and phenomena that man can not perceive with his senses such as microbes, atoms, angles, etc.], worship God [five times a day as established by Islamic laws] and give to charity a part of their income/ provisions [which God has provided for them at first place.] 
The above mentioned people are those who believe in this book (Qur’an) that I (God) have revealed to you (Mohammad) as well as the (original) Books that I had revealed to the prophets before you [which do not exist any more as they have been tampered with or partially/ totally lost] and firmly believe in the (existence of) Hereafter. 
The above mentioned people are on the right course (as shown by God) and are [”the real”] successful ones. 
As far as the disbelievers are concerned, in spite of your (Mohammad’s) warning, they do not care at all and they will never believe [in submission to the will of God.] 
(In account of their disobedience and disbelief) God seals their minds, their hearing and their eyes and they will be subject to a great punishment. 
There are (a third group of people known as hypocrites) who (verbally and not from the bottom of their hearts) proclaim that they believe in God and the day of judgment; but they are not true believers. 
They (hypocrites) think that by a simple declaration (of submitting themselves to the will of God) they can deceive God and the believers; in fact they do not deceive anyone but themselves and simply do not get it. 
These hypocrites have a disease in their hearts and [as they are not looking for a cure] God intensifies their disease and there is painful doom for them in store in account of their lies (attitude.)
And when they are told, “Do not to make mischief on the earth,” they reply: “[Our actions are meant with the best intentions]/ we are indeed the righteous ones.” 
The fact of the matter is: they are corrupt, but they do not realize it. 
And when they are told: “Believe as the people believe”, they say : “You are asking us to believe like those fools?” In fact it is they who are fools, but they do not realize it. 
And when they meet the believers, they say: “We believe,” but when they get together with their devil peers, they say: “We are indeed with you; we were just kidding.” 
God will pay them back their mockery and let them wonder like blinds (for a while.) 
These hypocrites buy the “darkness” paying the “light for it”; what a bargain! They have indeed lost the right path and God will not give them any guidance at all. 
Their case may be compared to the case of those who started a fire in the darkness. As soon as they started to see around themselves, God [in account of their mockery] took their light away and left them in absolute darkness; unable to see. 
Now they are deaf, dumb, blind and without guidance; naturally they can not find their way back to the right path. 
Their case may also be compared to the case of the people caught up in a frightening thunder storm. Whenever they see/ hear a thunder, their only reaction to overcome the fear of death is to put their fingers in their ears! Indeed unbelievers are overpowered by God. 
The lightening makes them almost blind but provides them with a few second of insight so that they take a few steps forward. If God decides to deprive them even of this favor (a few second of light), he can make them completely deaf and blind as he is capable of doing anything that he wishes. 
O mankind, worship no one but your Lord. The one who created you and people who lived before you; so that you may become righteous and get salvation.
Lord is the one who has made the earth habitable for you. He has created the sky as a canopy [a thin ozone layer covering the earth’s atmosphere like a canopy, without which we all die almost immediately]. He sends down from the sky water which causes the vegetations to grow [and create a food chain] as your provision. Do not then set up idols [in different forms and shapes] to rival God while you know that he is the only creator.
And if you have any (sincere) doubt about the source of this book that I (God) have revealed to My servant (Mohammad), I challenge you to get together with whoever you wish and do your best to compose a chapter like one of the chapters of Qur’an
But if you fail—and there is no doubt that you will fail--, then beware of the Hell fire which is being fueled by (guilty) men and burning stones prepared for the unbelievers. 
And give good news to those who believe and do good deeds that they will live in gardens in which rivers flow. Anytime they are served with fruits (and other provisions), they will say: “These are similar [though superior in quality] to what God was providing for us in earth”. The believers will have pure spouses and live in paradise forever. 
God is definitely not ashamed to refer to a tiny mosquito—or a bigger creature of his own—as an example to make a point. The believers get the message from the example; the unbelievers (on the other hand) will say: “What does God mean by these stupid examples?” Many are misled and many are lead by these examples to the right path; only the wicked ones are misled [as they do not get the message in account of their attitude.] 
Those who break a covenant that they have made with God, break apart what God has ordered to be joined and commit evil on earth, they are the losers. 
How can you reject the faith in God, knowing that you were dead and he brought you to life? Then He puts you to death and then He brings you back to life; and again to Him ultimately you will return. 
God is the one Who created for you everything on earth. Then He directed His attention to the heaven and perfected seven universes therein; and He is fully aware of everything. 
Your Lord said to the angles: “I am going to place man as my representative on earth.” They said: “Will you place on earth the one who will make mischief and shed blood? You know that we sing Your praises and glorify You [would you kindly explain the rational behind this decision of yours?]
[Once God created Adam, in order to answer the Angles’ question,] He taught Adam every possible subject and then asked questions about those subjects from the angles [making his points that in spite of the man’s shortcoming, he is given a higher level of learning capacity than the angles (who do not shed blood or make mischief) do not possess] 
The angles replied: “Glory being worthy of You, we do not know nothing more than what You have taught us. You are the one who knows everything and You are the Wise.” 
Then God said: “ O Adam, answer the questions that I asked the angles”. When Adam answered those questions, God said: “Did I not tell you That I know the secrets of heaven and earth as well as what you disclose and what you hide.” [Do you now realize why I want to put such a mischief making creature as my representative on earth in spite of all his shortcomings?] 
And I (God) said to the angles: “Fall prostrate before Adam,” which they did except Satan who refused; he was too arrogant of a disobedient. 
Then God said: “O Adam, live with your wife in Paradise and eat freely every fruit and enjoy every provision but do not approach this given tree (as a test of your obedience.”)
But [as it was expected] Adam and Eve fell prey to Satan’s temptation and [lost their as they disobeyed God and thus committed the first sin of the human being.] Then God said: “Go down to earth as enemies [a curse and punishment for disobedience.] You will stay there for a while with an appointed provision.” 
[Out of mercy] Adam received from his Lord some words of supplication. [Once he returned to his Lord with those words of supplication,] God forgave Adam as He is the most forgiving and merciful. 
Then I (God) said: “Get out all of you from the paradise. There will come guidance to you from me. Those who follow my guidance, will have no fear and no grief. 
“But those who disbelieve and reject My revelations, they will be dwellers of Hell living therein forever.” 
O’ Children of Israel! Remember how I showered you with My blessings; then fulfill your part of our covenant, that I fulfill My part of it, and respect none with awe but Me. 
Believe in what I have revealed in Qur’an which confirms the Divine source of your own Scriptures. Do not be the first who reject Qur’anic revelations. Do not trade away my revelations for small profits and be at awe with none but Me. 
And do not mix up the truth with lies; nor hide the truth knowingly. 
Worship Me on regular basis, devote a part of your income to charity, and join those who worship Me by bowing down before me. 
How is that you invite others to follow the Right path, while forgetting to follow it yourself? And this (hypocrisy) in spite of the fact that you read the Scriptures in which you are ordered to practice the righteousness! [Why are not you consistent?] 
God’s help and salvation is achieved through patience and worship. They are surely difficult tasks but not for those who respect God with an awe. 
The latter are those who firmly believe that at last they will meet with their Lord and that eventually they will return to Him. 
O’ Children of Israel, remember how I showered you with my blessings and appointed you above all the peoples of the world. 
Beware of the day that no one can be of help to anyone else, no intercession will be accepted, no ransom can be paid for the guilty one nor is any help available. 
And remember that We saved you from the slavery of Pharaoh’s people who subjected you to the worse persecution. They were killing your sons; sparing your daughters (for their pleasures.) That persecution was the most difficult test imposed upon you by your Lord [so that you may learn valuable lessons through hardship.] 
And remember that we saved you by opening the (red) sea and let you pass safely through it while we drowned Pharaoh’s army [who were charging after you] before your very own eyes. 
Also remember the shameful incidence of the time that you took advantage of days’ absence of Moses [while Torah was being revealed to him in Mat. Sinai] and started to worship the statue of a cow as your creator! How unjust of you. 
In spite of committing such a shameful sin I [God] forgave you so that you may become thankful.
Also remember My favor to you as I gave Moses Scripture and the Criterion [to distinguish between right and wrong] so that you may be guided [to the right path]. 
Also remember that when Moses [returned from Mt. Sinai] said to his people: “O my people, you have betrayed your souls by worshiping the statue of a cow. Ask your Creator to forgive you and slay the guilty ones among you.” Then God forgave you as He is the one Who accepts repentance and is the most merciful. 
Then [having an argumentative attitude] you said: “You know Moses’ we will not believe you unless God directly appears and talk to us!” At that very moment a thunderbolt struck you all and you died. 
Then I [God] brought you back to life so that you might become grateful for this favor.
Remember also when we sent the cloud to cast shadow over you and fed you with <i>manna</i> [falling on the ground like dew-drops] and <i>salva</i> [flying in thousands like quails], saying: “Eat of these clean and pure provisions.” All their rebellions did not hurt Us but harmed their own souls.
Remember also when I said: “[Fight with the unjust habitants of Jerusalem, conquer and] Enter into the town [Jerusalem] where you will find as many provisions as you want. Enter the gate (of the town) bowing down with humility invoking God’s name and granting general amnesty (to the inhabitants after the conquest.) Then I will forgive your sins and reward you generously .” [They replied: “Moses, you and your God go fight for us and once you conquer the town we will join you!]”
But the unjust among them did not obey God’s commands. Due to their disobedience, We sent down upon them a sever punishment from the sky. 
I (God) would like to remind you of the occasion when Moses prayed for water for his (thirsty) people. I answered his prayer saying: “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then springs gushed from the rock; the people of every tribe knew their drinking place.” [Then God said:] “Eat and drink of what God has provided for you and do no evil nor mischief on the earth.
Remember [instead of being grateful for receiving <i>mann</i> and <i>salva</i> from heaven] you grumbled: “O Moses, we can not stand this monotonous food ask “your” Lord to give us a variety of earthly 11crops such herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, onions [etc]. Moses said: “Do you wish to substitute the worse for the best? Then follow the order of God and go conquer the town [Jerusalem] wherein God will give you whatever you want. [In account of this ungrateful attitude], little by little, God sent upon them his wrath, humiliation and misery. That was the consequence of their disobedience, rejecting God’s revelations and killing God’s Messengers for no good reason.
[God’s wrath is sent upon unjust people.] Rest assured that any Muslim, Jew, Christian or Sabean who believes in God, the Day of Judgment, and does good things will not have fear, grief or sorrow. 
[O’ Children of Israel;] I would like to remind you more: When I raised Mt. Sinai on top of your head and (while you were at awe) you promised Me that you will carry my order: “Hold up to the book that I have revealed to you and make it a part of your daily life and refer to it frequently” so that you may become successful. 
After that [and in spite of such an impress event] you broke your promise! Nevertheless, I did not deprive you of My grace and mercy. Had I done so, you would have certainly been included among the losers.
You know well how some of you disobeyed God’s Sabbatical law (Exodus,12-17); I told them: “Be apes, resented by all.”
In this manner, I made them an example for God respecting people of their time, as well as for the generations to come 
[In another incident,] Moses asked his people to [follow the order of God and to] sacrifice a cow [to put its flesh upon a slaughtered man to bring him to life so that he introduce his killer]. Their response was: “You are kidding!” Moses said: “I seek refuge in God from these ignorant people.”
They [jokingly] said: “Ask <u>your</u> Lord what kind of cow it should be.” Moses responded: “God says that a middle aged cow is good enough. Now that you have your response, follow the Lord’s order.”
They [continued sporting and] said: “Ask <u>your</u> Lord about its color.” Moses said: “God says that it should be a bright and jazzy yellow colored cow .”
They [continued their jokes and] said: “Ask <u>your</u> Lord to be more specific as there are so many cows with these characteristics! then <u>God willing</u>, we will find it.”
Moses said: “God says that this cow has never been used for plowing the land or watering the crops; an absolutely healthy cow.” Finally they [realized that they are playing with the fire and] said: “Now we know exactly which cow it is.” Then they sacrificed the cow though still not convinced! 
Remember when you killed a person and then started to accuse each other. It was the will of God to reveal what you were trying to hide. 
I ordered to strike [the victim’s corps] with the flesh of the sacrificed cow. Thus God performed another miracle by bringing a dead person to life so that you may realize [His power and that the resurrection is a fact.] 
In spite of seeing all these miracles [with your own eyes], your heart became as hard as a rock. Your heart became even harder than a rock; after all, there are rocks that are pierced by water and become the source of a spring, being split so that a river pass through and even melt down when they feel the presence of the Lord. Know that [such awesome] God is not unaware of what you are doing. 
How do you expect these people to join you in belief? These are the same people who listened to the revelations of God, got the message and then, some of them, knowingly altered the words of God [to fit their purposes.] 
When they (Jews) meet with the believers they say: “We believe [in what you believe.]” When they get together in private, they say: “Do you not have any sense when you reveal to them what Got has revealed to us? They may present the same proofs against us in front of God.” 
Do they not realize that God is fully aware of what they hide and what they reveal? 
Then some of them, who are illiterate and have not studied the Scriptures, rely upon false rumors and fabrications [thinking that what they say is written in the Scriptures.] 
Shame and pity on the learned ones of them who fabricate some verses and then say: “These are the words of God.” They do so in order to make some money. They do not realize that they are digging their own grave with those hands [who fabricate lies against the Lord] and that what their earnings in this manner will lead to their ruins.
They say: “If the Fire of Hell has to touch us, it will be for a short period of time!” Ask them: “Has God promised this to you? God never breaks His promise.” Know that their sayings are baseless. 
Indeed the one who commits sins and is surrounded by wrongdoings will find himself in the Hell and has to stay there forever. 
Those who believe and do good deeds, will end up in the heaven and live there forever. 
I (God) took a pledge from (you) the children of Israel to worship none but God, be good to your parents, near ones, the orphans and the poor, say good words to people, worship God on regular basis and be charitable. However, except a few, most of you broke your promises and became rebellious. 
I also took a solemn pledge from you that you should not shed your own people’s blood and deport each other from their land. You promised and bore witness. 
Now here you are: killing each other, driving your own brothers out of their homes and gang up against each other. Even if the other side surrenders, you demand ransom for them in spite of the fact that the aggression against them was wrong at first place. You believe in a part of your book and disregard the other! What other punishment such people deserve except a miserable life in this world and a sever punishment in Hereafter. God is not unaware of what you do. 
These are the people who have sold their [everlasting] Hereafter for [a small price of a few day of] this world. I will certainly not reduce their sentence and they will not find anyone to help them. 
I gave the Scriptures to Moses and send many prophets after him. I strengthened [the position of] Jesus, son of Mary [the last prophet sent to the Jews] by many miracles and supported him with the Holy Spirit. What a shame that when a prophet came to you, and relayed those Messages of Mine that you did not like, you showed arrogance; some of them you denied and some of them you killed! 
They say: “Our minds are made up (and nothing can change our beliefs.) The fact of the matter is they are cursed by God [in account of their disbelief] and only a few will [be blessed with the faculty of accepting the belief and] believe. 
Now that God has sent them this Book, which confirms their Scriptures, they deny it! Are these not the same people who were praying for a mean of victory over the disbelievers? Yet when it was sent to them, they recognized it and chose to disbelieve in it! The disbelievers are cursed by God.
What a shame when someone decides to sell his own soul by choosing to disbelieve in the guidance sent by God; and what for? That God has [not revealed it to whom they wished and that He has] revealed it to the one that He has chosen out of His Grace! In this way they have earned curse upon curse and there is an awful punishment in reserve for the disbelievers. 
When they are told: “Believe in what God has sent to you,” they reply: “We [choose to] believe only in what is revealed to us (the prophets of our own race) and deny any [additional] revelations.” This in spite of the fact that it is the truth; confirming what is with them. If it is so, ask them: “Then how come you killed the prophets of God who were chosen from among yourselves, if you consider yourselves as believers?” 
Moses came with such undeniable miracles (such as splitting the sea that you witnessed yourselves); then you chose to worship a cow! How unjust of you. 
I took a solemn pledge from you while raising the Mount Sinai over your heads: “Follow my revelations to the point and be obedient.” They promised to believe but they rebelled. They were such phonies that they worshipped a cow! Tell them (O Mohammad): “If yours is belief, it is indeed a strange belief that makes you to do such evil things.” 
Tell them [the Jews]: “If you sincerely believe that the Paradise of God is reserved only for you (who claim to be the chosen people), then ask for death (so that you go directly to the Paradise and get rid of this miserable earthly life.)” 
But they will never make such a prayer as they are well aware of their disobediences. God is well aware of what the evil doers are up to. 
You (Mohammad) will find them (the Jews), of all the people, the most in love with this worldly life. They are in love with this world even more than the idol worshippers are in love with. They all wish to be given a thousand years life. [What they do not realize is that] Even if their wish is granted, they can not escape the punishment of God as He observes what they are doing. 
Say: “Anyone who resents (makes fun of) Angel Gabriel should know that [this high ranked Angel has a unique position as] he is commissioned to reveal the words of God (Qur’an) to you. Qur’an confirms the (original) Scriptures, provides guidance and gives you the good news [of the continuation of life after death in Paradise] for the believers.
Those who show animosity toward God, His messengers, His Angels [in general] and Angel Gabriel and Angel Michael should know that God is their enemy. 
Indeed I (God) have revealed to you the most convincing verses. Only the low lives will oppose My revelations. 
It is amazing how, after having made a pledge (with God), most of them disregard it. [This clearly indicated that] Most of them are disbelievers [although they pretend to be the believers.] 
Now that a Messenger of God has come to them, who confirms what is with them (the original Scriptures), a group of the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) choose to deny him. By doing so, they deny their own Scriptures
These are the same people who used to practice black magic. The Satan had convinced them that the greatness of the Solomon’s kingdom was due to such practices! Solomon, in fact, was never involved in these types of activities as he was a believer. The Satan’s army [who practiced such things], however, belonged to the camp of the disbelievers. The tatters were enchanted by the knowledge of the two Angels known as Haroot and Maroot who were sent to the Babylon. These two, however, would always teach the art of the black magic with the following warning: “The possession of this trial is only meant for your trial (to see how you will use it.)” People, instead, used their knowledge to cast a spell between husbands and wives leading to their separation. The sorcerers, naturally, could not harm anyone without the permission of God [some miseries in life is meant by God to make man stronger.] What they learned, however, did not profit them. Besides, they knew well [before selling their souls to Satan] that the sorcery will ruin their Hereafter. If they knew what price they are paying for their fascination with magic.
Had they believed in God and adapted a God pleasing way of life, they would have received much better reward from the Lord. If they only knew it. 
O’ believers, do not call the Prophet by the names which may be misinterpreted. Know that the disbelievers have to face an awful punishment.
The idol worshippers, as well as the Christians and the Jews alike, resent (among other things, out of jealousy) to see that something good (Qur’an) is being sent to you (and not to them) from the Lord. The choice, however, is the Lord’s; He is the One Who decides to shed his grace upon whoever He chooses (naturally based upon the merit of the recipient.) 
If God abolish an existing law of His [perhaps in account of not serving the time and purpose any more], He will replace it with another one which is more appropriate for you. Do you not know that God has control over everything [and may change His own laws at will]? 
Do you not know that the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to the Lord and you do not have any master or helper beside Him? 
Why do you argue with your Prophet [instead of just obeying the Lord’s orders] the same way that Moses was being disputed (the best example being the incident of sacrificing a caw which this chapter is named after) in his time.? The believers who follow the disbelievers’ tradition, will end up in the wrong path. 
Many followers of the Scriptures (out of envy) want to turn you (Mohammad) back to the disbelief (by involving you in lengthy discussions, arguments and disputes), in spite of the fact that they know well how truthful you are. You should be patient with them and forgive them and leave them to God for judging them in an appropriate time. Know that God is capable of doing everything. 
Worship God on regular basis and engage in charity. You will find your good deeds being recorded by God for a reward in Hereafter. God is watching over whatever you do. 
They (the followers of the Scriptures) say: “Only the Jews and Christians will enter Paradise.” They simply dream on. Ask them: “On what basis do you make such a statement? Show us your proof, if you are truthful.” 
The fact of the matter is, whoever sincerely submits himself to the will of God and leads a righteous life will end up in Paradise. Such a person neither fears nor grieves (for the loss of their life in vain.) 
The Jews say: “The Christians do not know the truth.” The Christians say: “The Jews do not know the truth.” [The funny thing is that] both of them read the [same] Scripture. The others, too, make similar claims. All these dispute will be solved in the Day of Judgment when the Lord points them where they were wrong.
Who is more unjust that those (the idol worshippers of Mecca) who prevent the believers to mention the name of God in places devoted to His worship (like in Mecca which is built by Abraham for the purpose of worshipping the Lord.) such people do not deserve to enter there. If they enter there at all, they should not feel safe. There is nothing but misery for them in this world and an awful punishment is waiting for them in the Hereafter. 
East or West, all belongs to God. No matter where you turn your face, God is there (therefore do not engage in a dispute about why Mecca is appointed as the direction of prayer.) Know that God is present every where and is the most knowledgeable (so obey Him and say your prayers toward the oldest place designated to the worship of God, i.e. Mecca.) 
They say: “God has adopted a son.” Shame on them. God is above such things. As a matter of fact, everything in the heavens and earth belongs to him and are submissive to Him. (See John 5:18-that Jesus refutes the claim that he is equal to God. in 5-he says: I can do nothing of my own...) 
God is the originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decides something to be created, He simply says: “Be” and there it is. 
Those who are not aware [of their physical/ mental shortcomings] say: “Why God does not talk to us directly; why do we not get any revelation?” People before them, with the same kind of mentality, used to ask similar questions. The fact of the matter is, the Lord’s signs are already available to the believers (the best example of such signs is this Qur’an which is in front of you.) 
The fact of the matter is, you (Mohammad) have been chosen to relay the good news (that the death is not the end and rather the beginning of the real life) and to warn the people (that the failure in the school of life will ruin one’s real life in Hereafter.) You will certainly not be held responsible for the behavior of those who will end up in the Fire (as your only mission is to relay the message.) 
Know that the Jews and the Christian will not be satisfied with you unless you accept their system of beliefs. let them know that: “There is only one reliable guidance: the guidance of God.” If you (Mohammad or anybody) follow their way of life (after being exposed to the God pleasing way of life), then you will find no one in the entire universe to protect you from [the punishment of] the Lord.
When the people, to whom the Scripture is given, read the Qur’an (the way that it should be read [objectively with no pre-judgments]) they believe in it. Those who choose to disregard it should know that they are simply the losers. 
Now the children of Israel, remember my favor to you when I made you the most favored nation. 
Be mindful of a Day when no soul will care about the other soul, no ransom will be accepted from any one, no one’s intercession will be helpful and no one will find any help whatsoever. 
Recall when [your first leader] Abraham successfully passed My tests and I told him: “Now I will make you the leader of all nations.” Abraham asked: “Will my heirs inherit this favor?” I said: “Not those who choose to be unjust.” 
Recall when I made Mecca a secure city for the assembly of the believers and ordered them to worship God where Abraham was used to do so. I asked Abraham and Ishmael to keep that house of the worship pure for the pilgrims who would circle it, retire to it for the prayer and bow down and prostrate (to humble themselves toward the Lord) in worship. 
Then Abraham prayed: “O Lord, bless this city with peace and security and provide its citizens, who believe in God and the Hereafter, with every kind of fruit.” [Accepting his prayer] I said: “I will also be generous to its disbelievers in this world but I will drag them to the Hell in Hereafter; indeed a miserable place to end up in.” 
As Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundation of the Mosque, they prayed: “Our Lord, please accept this act of ours [which is meant to please you.] We bear witness that you hear everything [including this prayer] and you know about everything [including our sincerity in this act.] 
[Then they continued saying: ] “Our Lord, make us your Muslims (Submitters.) Also kindly extend this favor to our heirs of the generations to come. Show us the most pleasing to You way of worshipping You. Forgive our shortcomings as you are the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” 
“Our Lord, kindly appoint one of them as your messenger so that he relays your messages to them, teach them your book and wisdom and to purify them. O You, the Most High, the Most Wise. 
Who else of Abraham’s nation can choose an alternative way of life except the one who has reduced himself to the level of a fool or an ignorant? I (God) chose him to serve me in this world and he will be among the righteous ones in the Hereafter.
When Abraham’s Lord said to him: “Be a Muslim (submit yourself.)”, he replied: “I am now a Muslim (Submitter) to the Lord of the worlds.” 
Abraham invited his children (Ishmael and Isaac) to the same way of life. So did Jacob (his grand son.) Jacob’s last will to his children was: “God has chosen this way of life for you; therefore, do not die unless in the state of Islam (submission to God.) 
You (Mohammad/ Muslims) were not present at the death bead of Jacob when he asked his children: “Who will you worship after me? “ They replied : “We will worship none but your God; the Lord of our forefathers: Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. He is the only God and to Whom we submit ourselves [and trust.]” 
They were a people of another time, responsible for their deeds. You will be responsible for your deeds and be rewarded accordingly with no reference whatsoever to them. 
They (Jews & Christians) say: “Choose Judaism or Christianity and you will get the true guidance.” Say: “No way; we resent any alternative way except the way of Abraham who did not worship none but the Lord.” 
[O Muslims,] Say: “We believe in God and whatever He has revealed to us and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes (Patriarchs.) We believe in what was (and unfortunately is not available in its entirety) revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets. We do not discriminate among any of them. We have completely surrendered ourselves to God as Muslims (Submitters.) 
If they believe, the way you have believed, indeed they will be in the right path. If they turn away from (God pleasing way of life), then they are in opposition. Rest assured that the reliance upon God suffice for your protection against them; after all, God Hears everything [that they say] and knows everything [that they do or going to do.] 
Say: “Baptize yourself by emerging in the way of God. After all, what baptism can be better than baptism of God. As to us, we worship only God and submit to Him alone.” 
Say: “We are talking about the same God. Why then you dispute with us [instead of obeying Him?] We will be accountable for our deeds and you for yours; [knowing this,] we have chosen to sincerely submit ourselves to Him. 
Do you want to say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and their children were carrying the title of Jew or Christian? Ask them: “Do you want to say that you know more than God?” Come to think about it, who can be more unjust than [your theologians] who hides the words of God? Know that God is not unaware of what you are doing.
They were a people of another time, responsible for their deeds. You will be responsible for your deeds and be rewarded accordingly with no reference whatsoever to them. 
Foolish people will say: “How come they were praying towards Jerusalem and now suddenly they changed their direction towards Mecca? Let them know: “East or west belongs to God and He is the One Who shows the way to be followed to those who He is pleased with.” 
I (God) have shown you a way to make you a justly balanced nation so that you may become a frame of references for the entire humanity. As to your frame of reference, you have your Prophet to follow. My commandment to take the direction of Jerusalem for saying your prayer was simply a trial to see who will follow the Prophet and who will disregard him. It was indeed a hard test (for the Arabs not to pray towards Mecca) but of course not for the believers who have been guided by God. Rest assured that God will not let this faith of yours being unnoticed as God is the Most King to the mankind and the Most Forgiving. 
I have seen you turning your face towards the sky in praying. Now I command you to take the direction of Mecca, that you love so much, to offer your prayers. From now on, therefore, whoever you are, turn your face towards “Masjid-Al-Haram (the oldest place devoted to the worship of God; built by Abraham & Ishmael) in Mecca while offering a prayer. Those who believe in the Scripture know that this commandment comes from the Lord. God is not unaware of what they are doing (not respecting the Lord’s commandments.) 
Even if you perform the most convincing miracle, Jews and Christians will not [obey the Lord’s commandment and] say their prayers facing Mecca. You, naturally, will not follow their direction either. As a matter of fact, they will not compromise even among themselves. Therefore, now that you have received the commandment, you are obliged to follow it. If you disobey this commandment, you have chosen to join the unjust people.
Those who believe in Scripture, they do not have any doubt about it and recognize (that Mecca’s Mosque was built by Abraham years before Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem) it the same way that they recognize their own children. Some of them, however, try to hid the truth.
The above mentioned is a commandment from your Lord; do not entertain any doubt about it. 
To worship God, people turn their faces to different directions. [The direction, however is not that important; what is important is to] Compete in doing good deeds. Know that God will gather you one day together. Indeed God is capable of doing everything. 
Wherever you are, say your prayers towards Majid-Alharam (in Mecca.) This is an order from your Lord. Do not think that God does not know what you are doing. 
Wherever you go, and wherever you are, say your prayers towards Masjid-Alharam. There is no dispute about this commandment except among the wicked ones. Do not fear them; instead fear me so that I may complete my favor upon you and guide you towards the right path. 
An example of my blessing is choosing a Prophet from among yourselves who is reading my revelations to you, purifying you, teaching you the Scripture and wisdom as well as what you never knew. 
Therefore, keep me in your mind so that I keep you in mind; always be grateful and never cover the truth. 
O you who believe, deal with the difficulties of life with patience and prayers. Know that God is with the patient ones. 
Do not consider those who give up their [worldly] life to please God as “dead.” As a matter of fact, they are alive but your brain is not capable of understanding this concept. 
I will try you in fear, hunger, poverty, death (of your dear ones), and loss of wealth. Let the patient ones know what a reward is awaiting them. 
When the laters face a disaster (mostly in case of the death of their beloved ones), they face it calmly and say: “We are originated by God and to Him we return [so why worry about this incident?]” 
These are the people who are well guided. God sends His Salutation to them and will shower them with His Mercy. 
Walking (as a show of belief) between the hills of Safa & Marwa (near Mecca) is a God sanctioned ritual (instituted by Abraham) and a part of the pilgrimage to Mecca. This ritual is not a sin (in spite of the fact that it was practiced unknowing of its origin by the pagans in the past); after all, God knows what is in your heart (that this act of yours is to please God and not to glorify the idols of the past.)
God and people curse those (religious scholars who have made the religion a monopoly of their own and do not share their knowledge with the people) who hide the Lord’s teachings as revealed in the Scripture (and is meant to enlighten the public at large) 
But I will forgive those of them who repent, purify themselves and teach the public what they were hiding. I am very generous in accepting the repentance and showing mercy. 
Those who persist in covering the fact and die as a disbeliever, they will carry the curse of God, His angles and all humanity. 
Such disbelievers will end up “living” in the Hell, forgotten forever, without any pity. 
Know that your Lord is the only God. There is no God but Him; the Most Merciful, the Most Forgiving. 
The creation of the heavens and the earth, the difference between day and night (due to the rotation of the earth around its axle), the sailing of the [huge] ships over the waters [without sinking], the water that god sends down from the sky to give life to the dead land and to support all kind of creatures, blowing of the winds and the masses of the clouds between the earth and the sky are indeed miracles witnessing [the existence and the greatness of] God for those who [use their brain to] think. 
[In spite of all these clear signs,] There are people who worship [things, beings and concepts] lower than God and adore them the way only God should be adored. The believers, on the contrary, worship God wholeheartedly. May the disbelievers wake up before facing their punishment in the Day of Judgment and realize that the ultimate power and authority belongs to the Lord and that God is sever in punishment. 
When God passes His Judgment upon the disbelievers, the very leaders who were used to “guide” them will refuse to acknowledge them as their bonds will be cut off. 
The followers will then say: “It will be nice to have a second chance in order to disown our idols the same way that they disowned us today.” God will thus show them that the regret is the fruit of their deeds and they will never be able to come out of the Hellfire.
O’ people, enjoy eating what is lawful and clean and do not follow the footsteps of the Satan (disobedience of God) as he is your #1 enemy.
Satan invites you to commit vices and indecencies and pretends that such style of life is ordained by God. 
When the non-Muslims are asked to follow the Lord’s commandments, they will say: “We prefer to follow the religion of our forefathers!” What if their forefathers were wrong and that their religion did not make sense? 
Such people are like the herd of cattle that hear the voice of the shepherd but can not understand its meanings. For all purposes and intentions they are deaf, dumb, blind and not capable of understanding anything. 
Enjoy eating the clean food that I have provided for you, the believers, and be grateful, if you are the worshippers of God. 
God hereby forbids you the consumption of the flesh of an animal which has been dead of itself (not slaughtered), blood, pork and any animal slaughtered in dedication to other “deities” except God (one cannot go around and kill the living species which belong to God without asking His permission first.) In case of emergency, however, you may eat even these forbidden foods (as much as it is necessary for survival and not to overindulge.) 
Those who [monopolize the religion and do not share their religious knowledge with the others,] hide the revelations of God from the public and alter the words of God [to accommodate someone’s lust] for a little bit of money should know that in the Day of Judgment God will not talk to them, will not purify them and they will get nothing but fire in their bellies as food in the Hell; awful will be their punishment. 
Such people trade guidance for loss and God’s forgiveness for His punishment! How bold (stupid) of someone to race towards the Fire. 
Their behavior is due to the fact that they have lost the message of God in account of dispute over what God had clearly explained to them. How argumentative these stubborn people are. 
Turning your faces towards the east or the west [during the prayer] is not [a sign of piety or] a virtue [and does not have any importance with God.] The virtue is the belief in God, the last day, the existence of the angles, the Book [sent by God] and the prophets [sent by God], sharing wealth with beloved ones, nearest ones, orphans, poor people, stranded travelers and the beggars [in distress], the act of freeing the slaves, worshipping the Lord on regular basis, paying the minimum charity [as imposed by God upon your income], honoring your words and pledges and patience in hardship, affliction of a disaster and in despair. Such are the sincere ones and considered as pious by God.
The capital punishment is hereby declared as a law for you the believers. The man or the woman who has committed the murder, regardless of his/her social status, should face the death. The victim’s kin, however, may pardon the murderer. An appreciative response, in the form of blood money, will be then in order. This leniency (turning the criminal case into a civil case) indicates how merciful God is [the State, therefore, does not have any right to prosecute the murderer on criminal basis.] Once the blood money is paid, those who recourse to retaliation (the relatives, state or any interested party) should know that they are invoking God’s anger. 
The intellectuals should realize that the above mentioned divine law guarantees the sanctity of life [and not the abolition of the capital punishment and/or the State’s intervention]; therefore, submit yourself to this law of your Lord. 
Another obligation of a believer is the preparation of a will. The God fearing people should divide whatever they leave behind in an equitable manner between their parents and their relatives [the guidelines are revealed later in Ch. 4.] 
As to those who change the will after having heard it, they commit a big sin. Bear in mind that God hears and knows everything. 
It is not a sin for someone to restore a will to its original state, if he knows for sure that there has been a mistake in it. Bear in mind that God is forgiving and merciful. 
O’ you who believe, fasting is hereby prescribed to you as it was decreed upon the God worshippers before you; may fasting increase your devotion to the Lord. 
You have to fast only a few days of the year. Those who become sick or have to travel [during these fasting days] should make it up later. Those for whom fasting imposes a hardship, must feed at least a poor person. The more generosity you show, the better it will be for you. Of course it is much better to observe fasting; if you only knew [how good it is for you.] 
[The Islamic month of] Ramadan is the month on which this Qur’an was revealed: a guidance for mankind, with clear signs [indicating its divine source] and as a criterion to distinguish the right from the wrong [in absence of a divine standard for judgment, there is no such thing as right or wrong as everything is justifiable.] From now on, you must observe the fast in the month of Ramadan. Those who become sick or have to take a trip, must later make up for the lost fasting days. Let it be known that God wants to make it easy for you rather putting you through the hardship. Fasting [in the month of Ramadan] is a way of worship that God wants you to perform so that you may have the opportunity to Glorify God and to show your thanks and appreciation for His guidance.
When My servants ask you (Mohammad) about me, let them know that I am closer than what they think to themselves. I answer their prayers when they call upon me; they, too, should listen to my call as this is the only way to be guided to the right path. 
[Although Ramadan is an opportunity to get closer to God through forgetting the mundane necessities of life such as eating, drinking, etc.,] I do not mind the continuation of your marital relationship with your wives after the fasting is completed at night. Your wives are like garments for you and you are like garments to your wives. Your Lord knew very well that [in spite of the fact that the sexual relations with your wives had never been prohibited,] You had developed a sinful attitude towards it; God has already forgiven you for this presumptuous attitude. Now it is clearly declared that you have the permission to have intercourse and enjoy all that God has made lawful for you. Therefore, after having broken the fast, eat, drink [and continue your normal life] until you see the white streak of dawn replacing the blackness of night. Then start fasting [and abstain from eating, drinking, sex inhaling heavy particles such as smoking] until the night fall. If you decide to confine yourselves to the Mosque [during the last ten days of Ramadan], you should abstain from having sex. The above mentioned are the lines drawn by your Lord; do not even approach the line. See how the Lord makes His Revelations clear to mankind; may man choose to respect the Lord. 
Do not devour each others’ property illicitly neither bribe a judge to make an unjust decision in your favor; you know very well that it is wrong. 
People ask you about the significance of the phases of the moon. Let them know: “They are simply a part of the natural calendar so that people [keep track of time] and prepare themselves for [the religious rituals such as] the pilgrimage to Mecca.” [In this connection let them know that:] “The virtue is not [practicing a bunch of nonsense such as] entering your houses from the back [as it was practiced before the advent of Islam during the month of the pilgrimage.] The real virtue is to respect the Lord. So (do not act like the idiots and) enter your houses by their proper doors; respect the Lord so that you may be included among the successful ones.
[Today, finally, you are given the permission to] fight in the cause of God against those who wage a war against. However, [as a peaceful nation that you are supposed to be by your very title,] do not begin the hostilities, for God does not like the aggressors. 
Face your enemies anywhere they challenge you and take back your lost lands/ homes from them. [Although killing, which is inevitable in fight is bad,] persecution is worth than killing. Do not fight with your enemies in/ around Masjid-Al-Haram (the first site of worshipping God, built by Abraham in Mecca.) But if they attack you there, you may strike back to kill; they deserve to die for their disbelief. 
If the above mentioned trouble makers stop, cease the fight. [See how] God is forgiving and compassionate. 
Continue fighting with the disbelievers until you succeed in establishing the Lord’s laws on earth. If they stop trouble making, leave them alone. Only those among them who are guilty of cruelty and brutality should be brought to justice. 
Respect “no fight” tradition [of Arabs during the four given months of the year] as long as they themselves respect it. The general law is “just retribution”; always bear in mind and know that God always sides with the righteous ones. 
Be generous in charity to please God and do not let your own hand [by being stingy] lead you to your ruin. Perform your obligations in excellence [and not out of obligation]; know that God loves graceful people. 
Your intention in voluntary and mandatory pilgrimage to Mecca (as well as any act of worship) should be aimed to please God. If (for any reason) you fail to complete your pilgrimage, slaughter an animal as an offering to God. Do not cut your head or shave until the sacrifice is completed. If a pilgrim’s hair has to be shaved due to medical reason, he must either offer a sacrifice, fast or give to charity. Now if your problems are over (and you reach Mecca earlier), then perform (extra) voluntary rituals of the pilgrimage and offer a sacrifice. If (for some reason) you fail to sacrifice an animal, then fast three days during the pilgrimage and seven days after returning home. The above mentioned rules apply to those who live far from Mecca. Never fail to respect God (and His commandments); rest assured that the Lord is sever in punishment.
The months during which the pilgrimage is supposed to take place are well known to all of you. Once the pilgrimage is started, abstain from all kind of sexual activities (intercourse as well as any kind of sexual talk, thought, etc.), immoralities, the slightest act of aggression (such as a harsh talk to a servant.) Remember that God counts all good deeds of yours. When leaving for the pilgrimage, take the necessary provision; of course the best provision for the pilgrimage is the piety. Respect Me (God), if you are among those who get the message. 
There is no blame on you, if you do some business while performing the pilgrimage (earning what God has assigned for you as your worldly provision.) Then when you pour down from Mount Arafat, praise your Lord in the Sacred place (Muzdaliffa.) Remember your Lord; the One without His guidance you were lost. 
Then join other people leaving the place, asking God’s forgiveness. Your Lord is most surely the Most Forgiving. 
When you complete the rituals, praise your Lord; the same way that you were praising your fathers and even with more devotion. Some people will pray their Lord to give them the best in this world; they will have no share in Hereafter. 
Some will pray: “O Lord, please give us the best in this world as well as the best in Hereafter and spare us from the Fire of Hell.” 
Each of them, pretty soon, will receive what they have earned as God is the most efficient in judgment.
Worship your Lord for a few days in <i>Mena</i>. You may contemplate there only for two days or you may extend your stay as long as the aim is to increase your faith. Observe your Lord and remember that you have to return to Him.
You will encounter some individuals (like some politicians of our time) who pretend having devoted themselves to the betterment of mankind. They even take God as their witness. Yet they are the most ardent enemy of mankind (meaning the action is the criterion and not the words.) 
When such person finishes his speech, he goes back to his routine corrupting the world and even destroying properties and lives (like some leaders of powerful nations who do not mind to destroy the people of less powerful countries for silly reasons.) God does not like such corrupt people. 
When it is said to such person: “Fear God”, he shows more arrogance. Such person has no other place to end up than Hell; what a terrible place to live in.
On the other hand, there are people who do nothing but to please the Lord. God, naturally, will turn kindly to them. 
O’ you who have chosen to believe, submit yourselves wholeheartedly [to your Lord]; do not follow the footstep of the Satan as he is your worse enemy.
Now if you slip after being exposed to such undeniable signs, know that you are challenging the Most Powerful and the Most Wise. 
Do they (the people in doubt) expect that God Himself come down in a dense cloud accompanied with the Angles [so that they believe?] If and when this happens, the matter will already be settled (and it will be too late for the declaration of the belief.) In any case, eventually every thing will be presented before God for the judgment. 
[The history shows that the miracles do not penetrate the heart of the stubborn people.] Ask the children of Israel how many undeniable miracles I presented them [and then they worshiped the statue of a cow!] Rest assured that the one who disrespects the favor of the Lord (say by altering the words of God), will be severely punished by God. 
The life of this world seems so appealing to the disbelievers that they make fun of believers who are not enchanted with it. Let them know that God will rank the believers above the disbelievers on the day of judgment. Let them also know that God gives whatever He want to whomever He wants. 
At the beginning, there was only one nation. God sent to this nation, the prophets (messengers) to give them the good news (about the meaning of their lives as well as the continuation of their lives in Hereafter.) God also sent them the book to be used in the settlement of their disputes. However, whenever a new prophet came with undeniable miracles, the jealous ones did not follow him (thus mankind divided himself into different nations.) God (of course) guided the righteous ones (who belong to the nation of submitters;) God will guide whoever He wishes to the right path. 
Do you dreaming on entering to the Paradise without passing through the trials that people before you had to go through? They faced such hardships that even their prophets and the most believers cried: “Will God’s promise ever come true?” Rest assured that the Lord’s help will arrive very soon (after all, what is a few years earthly time of hardship compared to the eternal life of the human being?)
People ask you about the charity. Let them know that God is aware (and pleased of) of People’s charitable contributions. Therefore, be charitable to your parents, near ones, people in need and the travelers in distress. 
Fighting (for the cause of the Lord) is already imposed upon you as a duty. You may not like the idea of fighting; however, there are so many things that you resent them and they are good for you. On the contrary, there are many things that look good at first sight but are bad for you. God knows [what is good or bad for you] while you do not know. 
People ask you about fighting in the Sacred Months [during which the Arabs were supposed to perform their religious rituals such as the pilgrimage to Mecca in peace.] Say: “Fighting during these months is a great sin. However, turning the believers from the path of God, disbelieving the Lord, not respecting the holiness of Masjid-Al-Haram (the oldest place of worshipping God) and driving people out from it are far greater sins. As a matter of fact persecution/ oppression is worse than murder. Rest assured that The disbelievers will not stop fighting you till you join them in disbelief and whoever chooses the disbelief and die as a disbeliever, has nullified all his good deeds and will end up living in Hellfire forever. 
Those who chose to believe, those who suffered the exile and those who struggled for the sake of God, look forward to earn the Lord’s mercy; and God is the Most Merciful, the Most Forgiving. 
People ask you about drinking and gambling. Say: “There are some benefits and harms in them. Their harms, however, outweighs the benefits.” They also ask you how much they should contribute to the charity. Say: “Anything above your needs.” See how clearly God makes His points so that you may contemplate upon this life and Hereafter. 
They also ask you how to treat the orphans. Say: “Do sincerely what is best in their interest. If you decide to take them as your partner and mix their properties with your own, bear in mind that you have to treat them like your brothers. Indeed God knows who has a good intention and who is a wicked. If God wanted, He would have imposed the strictest orders in this domain making the life more difficult for you. [But] God [does not want to make the life difficult for you as] is Almighty, Wise. 
Do not marry the disbelieving women, if they do not choose to believe. As a matter of fact, a believing slave woman is much superior to a disbelieving woman, even though the latter charms you. For the same token, a believing woman should not marry to a disbelieving men until he choose to become a believer. A believing slave is superior to a disbelieving man, even though you fall in love with him. The latter takes you to the Hellfire while God invites you to the Paradise and promises His Mercy upon you at His will. The Lord, thus, makes His revelations clear to you so that you get it.
People ask you about menstruation. Say: “It is nothing but an illness; avoid sexual intercourse with women during their period until they are back to normal and purify themselves. Then you may have sex in them any way which is approved by the Lord. Truly God loves those who turn to Him and care for cleanliness.” 
Your wives are the bearers of your seed; so, approach them as you want. But take advantage of your life and do some good for your soul before the entertainment. Respect the Lord and bear in mind that pretty soon you have to stand in front of Him. Now give good news to mankind (that he may choose to live in Paradise forever.) 
Do not swear to God casually in order to gain the trust and the respect of the people. Be mindful of your duties to God and make peace between the people. Remember that God Hears everything and that He Knows everything. 
God does not hold you responsible for your unintentional oaths. However, He will question you about serious oaths (such as testifying under the oath in the court). God is indeed Patient and Forgiving. 
If a man swears by God that he will not sleep with his wife any more, he has four month of separation (cooling off) period to make reconciliation. If he decides to take his wife back, God [will not hold him responsible for his swearing as God] is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
And if they decide to go on with the divorce, God Hears and understands. 
A divorced woman should wait enough to go through three periods before marrying to another man. It is against the law of God for a woman to hide her pregnancy, if she believe in God and the Day of Judgment. The husband has the right to return back to his wife while she is waiting to go through three periods. Husbands and wives have similar marital rights & obligations. The man (as the head of the household), however, is placed a degree above woman; and above all is God, the Almighty, the Most Wise.
A man may divorce [and re-marry his wife] only twice. Let your divorced woman to live in the same house with honor or let her leave, if she wishes. It is against the Lord’s law for husband to take back what he has already given to his ex-wife unless the woman wants to buy her freedom back by offering what her husband has offered her [the man then looses the right to take her back as she has bought back her freedom.] These are the laws of your Lord; do not take them lightly. Then one who disregards the law of his Lord is an unjust person. 
If a man divorces his wife for the third time, he cannot re-marry her. But if his wife re-marries another man and gets divorce, they may re-marry again, if they feel that they can live together in a God pleasing manner. God thus explains His laws clearly for those who use their brain to think. 
When you divorce your wife, and she finishes her (three menstruation) waiting period, let her live in your place with honor and in a God pleasing manner. Do not make the life miserable for her as this does not please the Lord. The one who commits such a cruelty is unjust to his own soul. Do not take the Lord’s laws in vain; remember the Lord’s favor in revealing this book of wisdom to you and know that He is aware of everything. 
Once your ex-wife has finished her waiting period, do not prevent her re-marrying her (ex-) husband, if they would like to live in a mutually honorable manner. This instruction is meant for those of you who believe in God and the Day of Judgment. Respecting this law purifies you and leads you to righteousness. Remember that you do not know as much as God knows. 
The divorced mother should nurse her baby until the age of two, if asked by the father. During this period, the father has the responsibility of taking care of the mother. Of course, no soul is supposed to suffer above and beyond his abilities. Neither the mother, nor the father’s life should be ruined in account of the infant. If the father dies, his heirs should assume these responsibilities. The parents may decide to bring up the child by the formula or by hiring a wet nurse, who is fairly paid for her services. Whatever you do, bear in mind that God is watching over what you are doing. 
If a man dies, his wife should not re-marry for four months and ten days (the waiting period for a pregnant woman is till her delivery.) Once their waiting period is over, they should not be prevented to choose any God pleasing style of life. Do not forget that God is fully aware of what you are doing.
While a widowed woman is passing through her waiting period, you may indirectly [not directly] propose to her or wait till she is over her waiting period of sorrow as God knows the innermost thoughts of yours. However, do not make any secret engagement. Whatever you intend to do, do it in an honorable manner. In any case, the formal proposal or marriage engagement must be done after the waiting period. Know that God knows even the most hidden thoughts of yours; so fear Him. Also bear in mind that God is lenient and the Most Forgiving. 
It is no sin, if you divorce a woman before having touched her or fixed a dowry (a traditional pre-agreed sum to be paid to the woman before or after divorce) for her. Pay them something anyhow; the rich man according to his wish and the poor man according to his ability. A fair compensation is due upon the righteous man. 
If you have set a dowry (divorce insurance) for your wife and you divorce her before having touched her, then pay her half of the dower unless she, or the one who has a saying in the marriage (such as the parents of the girl) give it up. Of course it is more just and closer to the righteousness to forget about the half of the dower. you should be generous and friendly among yourselves as God knows what you are doing.
Take your daily prayers seriously, especially the noon prayer, and devote yourselves completely to the Lord.
If you are in a situation that cannot properly worship the Lord, say your prayers while walking or riding. Later, make up those lost prayers in a manner that God has taught you [the best way of worshipping the Lord] and you did not know it before. 
Make a will and provide at least one year financial support for your wife, if she decides to stays at your place. It is your widow’s right to stay less than a year at your household, if she decides to do something good with her life (re-marry, move with her parents, etc.) Remember that God is Almighty and the Most Wise.
It is also the duty of a God fearing man to provide a reasonable support for his ex-wife. 
[See how] God clearly explains His Revelations so that you understand them. 
Think about those Israelites who were afraid of “Exodus” God made them die and then brought them back to life to show them their baseless fear. God is really kind to mankind but not lot of people know that. 
Fight for the cause of your Lord and know that God hears everything and knows everything. 
Have you ever thought about those [Israelites] who fled their [God given] homes [and refused the order of God to fight against the Philistines and earn their homes] in spite of the fact that they were thousands [and had numerical superiority over the disbelievers]? God [was so disappointed at that that] said to them: “Die” [and they lived like dead people for forty years wondering in the desert.] Then God [out of mercy] gave them life [and appointed brave leaders such as David for them to defeat the disbelievers of Phalestines.] Indeed God showers people with His blessing but most of them do not realize it [and in consequence are not grateful.] 
Have you ever thought about the [attitude and the behavior of the] leaders of Israel after Moses? They asked their Prophet [Samuel, who had become old and not capable of fighting,] to beg the Lord to bless them with a king to lead them in fight in the cause of God. When their prophet asked about weather or not they will stick to their promise to fight they replied: “How could we refuse to fight when we are driven out of our land [by the Amalikites about 1,B.C.] and separated from our family?” However, when God gave them the permission to fight, the majority turned away. God is aware of what unjust people do. 
The Prophet of Israel said to them: “God has appointed Saul as your King.” They responded: “How can God appoint him as our king while any one of us is more qualified than him? He is not eve rich!” Their Prophet responded: “God has given him knowledge and physical power (which is more important than wealth that you use as the only criterion.) God will bless whoever He chooses; [do not question the wisdom of Almighty as] He is the Most Knowledgeable.
Their Prophet continued: “As a sign of the Lord’s approval, under Saul’s leadership you will get back the Arc which will be carried by the angles and contains what is left from Moses and Aaron (the fragments of the tablets given to Moses in Mt. Sinai, the original copy of the Torah, a bottle of Manna and probably the staff of Moses) to pacify and secure your hearts; may this sign increase your belief. 
When Saul started to march his army he said to his troop: “There will be a river in our passage. God will try your faith by the mean of this river. Those who drink from its water, except a sip perhaps, do not deserve to be a part of my troop. Most of them, however, failed the test and drank from the river. When they faced the enemy, they said: “We surely are incapable of beating Goliath and his mighty army.” The believers among them replied: “Throughout the history, many times a few believers, with the help of God, have defeated the mighty army of the disbelievers. God sides with those who are patient.” 
When they faced the army of Goliath, they prayed: “Lord, pour down upon us patience and give us the strength and give us victory over the disbelievers.” 
And God helped them to defeat the army of the disbelievers and David killed Goliath. Then God blessed David with kingship, knowledge and wisdom as He willed. If God does not help the believers in their struggle against the disbelievers, the world will be a chaotic place dominated by mischief makers. Fortunately, God loves His realm of creation. 
These verses are the word of God revealed to you (Mohammad.) Indeed you are a true Prophet of God. 
I have blessed My Prophets in different manners. One of them (Moses) I talked directly with. The others were elevated in ranks in other ways. I endowed Jesus, son of Mary, with undeniable miracles and supported him with the Holy Spirit. If God had wished, people would not be divided among themselves after the death of their Prophet. That is why they dispute among themselves [as a mean of test and trial so that] some choose to believe and some choose the disbelief. If God had willed, there would not be any fight among themselves but there is wisdom in the will of God. 
O you who believe, please God by spending in charity out of your income [which is given to you by the Lord at first place] before a day comes when no bargaining, kinship or intercession will be accepted. The disbelievers [who reject the Lord’s orders] are indeed the most unjust [to themselves.] 
There is no deity beside God. He is Alive and Eternal. He never sleeps nor takes a recess. Anything that exists in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him. No body has the power of intercession in His Court except with His permission. He knows what have people done in the past and what is awaiting them. No one is as knowledgeable as God and He gives as much knowledge as He wills to whoever He decides to bless him with. His Kingship is spread all over the universe and includes the earth and the heavens. Ruling over such vast realm of existence does not bother Him a bit as He is The Most High, the Great. 
There is no force in belief. The right and the wrong are clearly defined. The one who reject the idols (in any shape and form) and choose to believe in God has indeed hung to a strong rope of security that never breaks. God Hears and is Aware. 
God is the Lord of those who have chosen to believe; He takes them from the darkness to the light. He is as well the Lord of those who have chosen their idols (money, women, position, etc.) as their masters: The ones who have left the light and have taken refuge in the darkness. They are those who will abide in Hellfire forever. 
Have you ever given a thought to what Abraham told to the [arrogant] one that God has blessed him with the kingship. Abraham [invited him to the faith and] said: “The Lord is the One Who gives life and takes life away.” The king said: “I can do the same [freeing a prisoner and killing another one.]” Abraham put the king on his place saying: “Can you also make the sun to rise [so regularly, every day] in the east and set on the west?” God does not guide the unjust people [like the king in this story and let them slide deeper into their miserable destiny.] 
Think also [about the greatness of God by pondering] about the story of the man (probably Uzair) who passed by a ghost town and said: “How can God bring such dead people back to life?” Then the Lord took his soul for a hundred years and when He restored it back to him asked: “How long have you been sleeping?” The man replied: “A few hours or at most a day.” God said to him: “look at your food and drink; they are not spoiled in the least in spite of the fact that you have been dead for a hundred years. I performed this miracle as an example for your peers. Now [in order to impress you the most] look how the bones of your donkey will be reassembled and the meat cover them when I bring it back to life.” When the man saw such reality with his own eyes he said: “Indeed God is capable of doing anything He wills.”
Abraham, too, asked such a question from his Lord. God said to him “Do you doubt me?” He replied: “Not at all; I simply want to see it with my own eyes.” God said: “Take four birds and tame them with yourself. Then cut them into pieces and place a piece on each hill. Then call them and they will come running to you in one piece. Then know for sure that God is Almighty, All-Wise.” 
The return on the money that people spend on charity, is similar in size to the return on a simple grain, which once planted, produces seven spikes, each spike producing one hundred grains. God thus returns back many folded to whoever he wills. God is Ample-Giving and the Most knowledgeable. 
Those who sincerely spend their money in the cause of God, and do not make a big deal of it, will be generously rewarded by their Lord; they will not be sorry nor will they grieve 
Kind words and forgiving people’s faults is much better than a charitable action followed by a cutting remark. God is the wealthiest; He is not in need of any one and is the Most Tolerant. 
A believer should not spoil his charity by making a big deal of it up to the point that it hurts its receiver. Those who spend on charity in order to be seen in fact do not believe neither in God nor the Day of Resurrection. They are as barren as a rock with a little bit of soil on which looses its productive capacity once the rain washes the soil. They gain nothing from their charity as God does not guide the disbelievers. 
Those who spend on charity to sincerely please the Lord are like gardens on a high and fertile land. If heavy rains falls upon such land, it will increase its production (instead of ruining it.) Even if it does not rain heavily, light moisture suffice to keep it growing. Know that God sees what you are doing. 
Does anyone of you wishes to experience loosing his fertile garden of palm-dates and vines where the water flows abundantly to fire while he is old and has children not capable of taking care of themselves? (if not, then do not provoke the Almighty’s anger.) See how God clearly makes His points so that you mediate upon.
O’ you who believe; spend a part of your (God appointed) income that you have honestly earned to please God. Also give away a part of the agricultural products that your Lord has produced for you. Do not even think about giving as charity those rotten things of yours that you yourself will accept it with only closed eyes. Know that God is the wealthiest (and not in need of your charity) and the Most Praise-Worthy. 
The Satan frightens you with poverty (preventing you from charity) and invites you to commit indecencies (to make more money as a security cushion.) God, on the contrary, promises to forgive you and to increase your standard of living. God is Ample-Giving and Knows everything. 
God grants wisdom to whoever He wills. The one who is showered with wisdom is endowed with a great wealth. Only the intelligent people mediate about these matters. 
God knows anything that you spend on charity or any charitable pledge that you fulfill. As for the unjust people, they do not have any to help them. 
It is O.K. to spend openly on charity; however, it will be much better to help the needy people as an unknown person as it will washes more of your sins. God knows well what you are doing. 
It is not your job (O Mohammad) to make believers out of people. Only God will guide the ones who deserve to be guided. Anything you spend on charity is for your own good, if you do it to please the Lord. Whatever you spend on the cause of God will be paid back to you in full and you will not face any injustice. 
Those who are persecuted are entitled to charity. They are dignified people who give an appearance of being in no need to the ignorant people. They rarely ask for help; however, you can recognize them through certain signs. Any charitable expenditure by you is well known and appreciated by God. 
Those who spend their belongings on charity during the day or at night and publicly or secretly, have their reward with their Lord. They is no fear or grief for them. 
Those who charge interest for a loan are possessed by the devil that has convinced them that receiving interest is as legitimate as trade. [They do not realize that] God has forbidden charging interest [that is why Jesus, according to the Bible, attacked the money lenders in the temple] and has blessed the trade. Those who quit charging interest, after being exposed to this revelation, are God willing forgiven. Those who continue to practice charging interest, will end up living in Hellfire forever.
God frowns upon charging interest and blesses charity; He does not like the wicked that disobey Him. 
Know that those who choose to believe, do good, worship the Lord on regular basis and engage in charity have a reward reserved for them with God. They will not end up in sorrow and grief. 
If you have chosen the belief, fear God and immediately stop charging interest on the loans that you have already extended. 
Not giving up charging interest is like declaring war with God and His Prophet. If you give up charging interest, you may keep the capital. Be just and you will be treated justly. 
It will be nice of you to give extra time to someone who owes you money and faces financial difficulties in repaying his debt. If you write off such loan as charity, it will be much better for you, if you only knew. 
Fear the Day in which all of you have to stand in front of your Lord for the Judgment. On that Day every soul will receive what it has earned and non will be treated unjustly. 
When Muslims are involved in a transaction, they must write down the terms of the transaction. They may ask an impartial person to do the writing; this person may not refuse the request as, by doing so, he shows his gratefulness to the Lord who has thought him the knowledge of writing. The debtor will make the dictation and the writer has to fear God and not to cheat. If the debtor is mentally/ physically incapable, his guardians should take care of dictation. two just men should witness the transaction. If there are not two men available, one man and two women suffice for this purpose. That is because, if a woman changes her mind, the other one remind her. The witnesses may not refuse to testify, if called for later. Write down as in detail as possible and explain everything, including the time of re-payment of the debt. The above mentioned process pleases the Lord. If the transaction is on the spot, however, there is no need for being written down but it does not harm to have witnesses. It will be very wicked of you to harass a witness. God, thus, is teaching you; be mindful of the Most Knowledgeable. 
If you are traveling, and you can not find someone to write down the transaction, ask for collateral. Once the debt is paid back, the collateral must immediately be returned. Say the whole truth once asked to serve as a witness. Only those who have a disease in their heart commit the sin of not revealing the whole truth. Do not forget that God knows what you are doing.
To God belongs everything which is in the heavens and on the earth. God will hold you responsible for what you make public or the innermost secret of your thoughts. The Lord punishes whoever He wills [and deserves to be punishment] and forgives whoever He wills [and deserves to be forgiven.] He is Almighty.
The Prophet (Mohammad) has absolute belief in what is revealed to him. The believers also believe in the Lord’s revelations. They believe in God, His Angels and His Books. The believers do not discriminate against any Prophet of God. They say: “We heard and obey. We ask for Your forgiveness and know that to you is the end of all journeys.” 
God never tries someone with a difficulty beyond his capacity. You will be rewarded for what you earned and punished for your disobediences. [Therefore ask in your prayers:] “Lord please do not punish us for our sins and shortcomings. Lord; please do not try us with more difficult trials than the ones before us. Lord please do not make us go through the difficulties that we are not capable of standing them; pardon us and forgive us. You are our Lord; then help us [your soldiers] to overcome the disbelievers.”
ALM
God [the originator of the universe] is alive and eternal; in fact there is no God but He.
It is God who has sent down this book to you which has brought the Truth and confirms the [divine source] of the previous scriptures. 
Before that, God gave Torah (to Moses) and the Gospel (to Jesus) to serve as a guidance for mankind and revealed the criterion [to distinguish between right and wrong]. Those who disbelieve in God’s revelations will suffer a severe punishment as God is Almighty and avenger of wickedness. 
There is nothing hidden from God on earth nor in the heavens. 
He is the one Who in the wombs [or lab tubes, if it should be the case] as he wills. There is no divinity but He, the Almighty, the Wise. 
He is the One Who sent down this Book to you. There are two kinds of versus in this book: those [the majority of the versus] which are straight forward (and precise in meaning:) they are the essence of the Book. The remainder [few verses] are ambiguous. Those who have doubts in their hearts always go after the laters and try to interpret them arbitrarily and create mischief. In fact nobody except God knows their real meaning!17.Those who have faith, on the other hand, say: “We accept these versus [though we do not know their meaning yet] to be all words of God.” 
[The believers pray to God:] “Our Teacher & Guide, let not our hearts return back to ignorance now that You have guided us. Shower us with your mercy as you are the most generous.
Lord! You will surely gather all mankind together on a day that there is no doubt about it as God never breaks a promise.” 
Those who have chosen disbelief, [in the day of judgment] will be condemned to become the fuel for Hell; neither their wealth nor their children can save them from God. 
[The laters, like] the people of Pharaoh, and the disbelievers before them, rejected God’s revelations; consequently, God punished them for this sin of theirs. 
Say (O Mohammad), : “The time is approaching fast when you will be overpowered and thrown in Hell; and the hell is a horrible place to live [in forever.]” 
You recently witnessed how your troop [in the first battle of Islam] defeated the disbelievers in spite of the fact that as you saw with your own eyes they were twice as big as your troop! Indeed God strengthens with his aid whom he pleases. Here there is an important lesson for those who are open-minded thinkers. 
The worldly pleasures (such as love for women, children, gold and silver, nice horses, cattle and crops, etc.), that preoccupy people, are as short in nature as this life. The ever-lasting (and the best) place to live is with God (in Hereafter). 
Say: “Let me inform you of a better alternative. For those who lead a God pleasing life, the Lord has reserved the splendid gardens wherein the water flows underneath and they will live with their pure wives under the protection of God. [Therefore, watch out as] God is watching His servants.” 
Such place is reserved for those who pray: “Lord, We have chosen to believe in you. Please forgive our sins and protect us from the Hellfire.” 
Such people are patient, truthful, true worshippers of God, generous in charity and beg for the Lord’s forgiveness in the early hours of the morning. 
God hereby witnesses that there is no Lord beside Him. The Angels and the learned men too stay by their Lord’s word. God manages His kingdom of creation with justice. There is no other God beside the Almighty, the Most Wise. 
The only acceptable religion in the sight of God is Islam (as presented to Abraham and all other prophets including Moses, Jesus and Mohammad.) The followers of the former religions sinfully deviated [from this God pleasing way of life] after God revealed the Book to their prophets. Thus, those who disbelieve in the Lord’s revelations would find it that God is fast in punishing such a sin.
Therefore, if they (the followers of other man made religions) dispute with you, say to them: “My followers and I have submitted ourselves only to God {and call ourselves the Submitters (Muslim in Arabic)}” Then say to the Jews, Christian and those who are ignorant: “Are you also willing to submit yourself to the will of God?” If they say “yes”, they are guided. If they refuse, do not worry [or take it personally] as your only mission is to relay the words of the Lord; leave them to God as He watches over His servants. 
Let those who choose to disbelieve in the revelations of the Lord and wrongfully kill the Prophets of God (and slay those who promote justice), know that an awful punishment is waiting for them. 
Such are people who have nullified their good deeds and will not find any help in Hereafter. 
Can you believe the behavior of some of those who have inherited only a portion of the Divine Book? When you offer them the whole Book, so that they use as a mean of guidance in their lives, they simply turn away in challenging God’s wisdom! 
The reason for their carelessness is they are deceived by their fabrication that: “The punishment of the Hellfire will be only for a short period of time!” 
What a surprise they are for, when they are gathered together on the Day of Resurrection which, there is no doubt about it. On that Day, every soul will receive what it has earned and none will be dealt with unjustly. 
Say: “O Lord! Power is yours. You give power to whoever you decide and take power away from whoever you choose. You take whoever you desire to the highest rank and bring down whoever you choose to the lower rank [for a good reason.] All good is at your disposition and you are capable of doing whatever you will.” 
“You are the One Who [turn the earth around its axle and] make the day appear after the night and the night take over the day. You are the One Who brings forth living from dead and take away life from the living. You are the One showering whoever you decide with your limitless blessings.” 
The believers should never ally with the disbelievers, except to avoid persecution. Whoever does so, should not expect any help from the Lord. God, therefore, reminds you that you should respect Him and know that your journey ends in meeting with Him. 
Say: “Whatever you hide in your heart or make it public, God is aware of it. As a matter of fact, God knows everything which takes place in the heavens and on earth and is in absolute control.
On the Day that a soul has to face the evaluation of its deeds, it will wish that a vast distance would separate it from its misdeeds. God [out of His mercy] reminds you that you should respect Him; The Lord is indeed merciful towards those who obey Him. 
{O Mohammad,] Say: “If you love God, then follow me [who am relaying the will of God to you.] God will love you and forgive your sins as He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” 
Say : “Obey God and His Prophet. Beware that God does not love those who choose to reject His call.” 
Know that God has elevated Adam, Noah, the descendents of Abraham and the family of Imran [father of Moses] to a higher rank [of the prophet hood.] 
They all belonged to the same chain and were the offspring of one another. God is the Most Knowledgeable and Hears everything. 
A [pregnant] woman of Imran’s family [sincerely] turned to God and said: “O Lord, the Most Knowledgeable, Who hear everything; I offer my [unborn] child to you. May you give him a mission to accomplish [and earn your pleasure.]” 
When she gave birth to the child she [in a disappointed tone] said: “I delivered a girl.” Of course God knew that she gave birth to a girl. The lady continued: “The male is not [socially/ physically handicapped] like a female [and a male would have served the purpose for which I had dedicated my child better.] I am going to name Her Mary and trust you to protect her and her offspring from the rejected devil.” 
The Lord then accepted the nice gesture of the woman and let Mary to grow up and become a pure and beautiful woman under the custody of Zachariah. Anytime that Zachariah would enter her room, he would find food there. When he would ask who has offered you this food, Mary would answer: “It is from God. The One Who generously provides for whoever He wills.” 
[On his old days] Zachariah prayed: “O Lord; You Who Hear the prayers, grant me a righteous child please.” 
While standing in worship of the Lord in the sanctuary, the angles appeared to him saying: “We are here to give you the good news of the acceptance of your prayer. Your child will be John; a noble, moral and righteous Prophet blessed with receiving the revelations of God.”
Zachariah said: “Lord, how is it possible to have a child at this old age of mine with a sterile wife?” The answer was: “God is capable of doing whatever He wants to do.” 
Zachariah said: “Lord please assure me with a sign.” He was replied: “Your sign is that you will not be able to talk to the people, except in sign language, for three days. Go and praise your Lord’s name as much as you can and glorify Him in the evening and early in the morning.” 
The angles then appeared to Mary saying: “God has chosen and purified you. He has chosen you in preference to all the women of the world.” 
“O Mary, Obey your Lord; humble yourself in bowing down and falling in prostration while you join the worshippers of the Lord.” 
God is hereby informs you of the unseen. After all you were not there when [the priests] recourse to casting lots to choose a guardian among themselves for Mary [who was given by her mother to the temple] and started to dispute among themselves. 
The angels then appeared to Mary saying: “We have good news from God for you: The name of the child that you carry will be Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary. He will be highly honored in this world and will be among the closest ones to God in Hereafter.” 
“Jesus will talk to people in the cradle and in his old age and he will be among the righteous ones.” 
Mary said: “O Lord, how is it possible for me to have a child while none has touched me?” The Lord replied: “That is the way God creates. When He wants to create something, He simply says “be” and there it is created.” 
“And God is going to teach Jesus the Book, the wisdom, the Scripture and the Gospel (see Luke 4-18.)” 
And Jesus said: “I have been appointed as a Prophet to the Jewish nation. I am blessed by my Lord with the following miracles: I will make a bird out of clay; then I will blow into it and make it a real bird by the will of God (see John 8-28.) I will restore the vision to the blind, heal the leprous and bring dead back to life by the will of the Lord (se John 12-49.) I will tell you what you eat and what you have stored at the privacy of your home. All these miracles in order to convince those who believe in God (see John 3-2.)” 
“I (Jesus) proclaim that the Scripture and Torah are sent by God (see Luke 10-26). I am commissioned to revoke certain prohibitions imposed upon you. I have come to you with clear signs from the Lord; So, fear God and follow me.”
God is indeed your Lord and mine (see John 20-17). Obey Him (See Matthew 4-Luke 4-8); this is the right path to follow.” 
When Jesus felt public’s resentment, he said: “Who will support me in my Devine mission?” His disciples replied: “We consider ourselves helpers of God. We believe in God; we are Muslims (Muslim in Arabic means submitter to God.) 
[The disciples then prayed:] “Lord, we believe in what you have reveled to us. We will follow your Prophet. May you enroll us among those who witness [the truth.]” 
They (the corrupt Jews who were killing the Lord’s Prophets one after another for daring to guide them to the right path) devised a plan (seeking for his death sentence through the Romans) and God devised a plan of His Own (condemning the Jews to the misery till the Day of Resurrection.) None can atop the Lord’s plan. 
God then said: “O Jesus, I am recalling you from your mission (as these people do not deserve my favor) and summon you to myself and disinfect you from the attack of the disbelievers. I will give superiority to those who followed you (Christians) over those who rejected you (the Jews) until the Day of Resurrection. Then You will all return to me so that I judge about what you were disputing over.” 
As to those who chose the disbelief, they will be harshly punished in this world as well as in Hereafter for their attitude and they will not find anyone to help them. 
As to those who chose to belief and dedicate themselves to do good, their reward will not be spoiled. God does not love [only those who are] unjust people. 
These revelations are being recited to you as a wise reminder. 
The creation of Jesus (being born without the intervention of a male) is like the creation of Adam (who was created without any father.) I (God) created Adam’s body from the dirt and then said: “Be” and here he was. 
Whatever God reveals is the truth; never doubt the words of your Lord. 
Now that the truth has been revealed to you, you may challenge anyone who disputes with you and say: “Let us get together and bring your children and wives with you; then let us ask sincerely our Lord to put a curse on the one who lies.” 
The truth is: “There is no other god beside God and He is Almighty, the Most Wise.” 
Now if the disbelievers refuse such challenge, let it be known that God is fully aware of what the mischief makers are up to.
Say: “O the followers of the Scripture, let us establish a common ground: That we worship none but God; that we do not associate no partner with God, that we do not idolize any human being (whether such person is a Prophet, sport champion, actor, politician, etc.)” Now if they refuse this proposal, say: “Bear witness that we are Muslim (submitters to God.) 
O you the followers of the Scripture, Why do you argue about [the religion of ] Abraham [as to whether he was a Jew or a Christian?] Do you not realize that the Torah (being used to give birth to Judaism) and the Gospel (being used to create Christianity) were revealed long after him? (if Abraham was on the right path, then there is no need to follow “man-made” Judaism or Christianity to attain salvation.) Why do you forget about logic [in your discussions]? 
You have already disputed [and changed the nature of the truth] of what you had at least some knowledge about it. Why are you now disputing about what you do not have any knowledge about it? God knows and you do not know that: 
Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian. He was a Muslim (Arabic word for “submitter to God”), decisive in submission to God, and [unlike the Christian who make of Jesus a partner of God,] he never associated any partner with God. 
The people most worthy of associating with Abraham are those who followed Abraham, those who are following Mohammad (who has re-established the faith of Abraham) and those who believed in God. Let it be known that God is the protector of the believers. 
Some of the followers of the Scripture wish to convert you to their belief. They do not get it that [by being so fascinated with their own created faith] they are the ones who are unjust to their souls but do not realize it. 
O you the followers of the Scripture, why do you reject the undeniable miracles of God that is taking place in front of your own eyes? 
O you the followers of the Scripture, why do you falsify the truth and hide the truth that you are aware of it? 
Some of the followers of the Scripture [have recourse to a trick to dishearten the Muslims by] saying in the morning that they have believed and later in the day proclaiming that they are disgusted with Islam [for such and such reason.] 
[Their contention is:] “follow only the one who is of your own religion.” [In response to such statement] say to them: “The true guidance comes from God (and not necessarily from someone of your own religion) Now if they start disputing with you about the subject Say: “ Blessing someone with His revelation is at the discretion of God, the Generous, the knowledgeable [He may, therefore, bless whoever He wills with His revelations whether the person is a Jew or not.)”
God chooses for His favor whoever He wills and there is no limit for His Grace. 
[Not all the followers of the Scripture are alike.] Some of them can be trusted with a hoard of Gold. Some of them, on the contrary, cannot be trusted even with a coin as you have to beg them continuously so that they pay that back. They are the ones who say: “God will not hold us (the chosen people, loved by God) responsible for our dealing with the gentiles!” They falsify the word of God and they know it well (See Deuteronomy Ch. vs. as an example of such falsification.) 
No way; God loves only those who are men of their words and do not fall into the Satan’s trap. 
Those who trade away their belief and sell their covenant with the Lord for a small price, they have no share of Hereafter. God will not look at them, not talk to them nor purify them on the Day of Resurrection; indeed there is an awful punishment in reserve for them. 
Among the followers of the Scripture you will find some who twist the words out of context. They also pretend that the falsified verses of the Scripture is the word of God while it is not true. They lie and they know it very well. 
No man, to whom God gives the Book, wisdom and Prophet hood, would say to the people: “Worship me instead of God (as Christians attribute it to Christ.)” Such person (Jesus) will surely say: “Worship none but the Lord (Matthew 4-10.) Be sincere Rabbis in teaching the Scripture as you have learnt (and do not falsify it.)” 
Nor would he (Jesus) command you to take Angles (such as Holy Spirit/ Angle Gabriel) or Prophets (such as himself) as your Lords. Does it make sense to you that he would try to invite you to disbelief after having invited you to Islam (meaning submission to God in Arabic)? 
[Know that] God gathered all prophets and said: “I will give you the wisdom and the Scripture; then I will send a Prophet of Mine (as explained in Luke 22-Matthew 24-Malachi 1-who will confirm [the Divine source of] your Scriptures [and finish your teachings.] Do you agree to believe in him, help him [by laying the grounds for him] and carry the heavy responsibility of this covenant of yours with Me ?” They all said: “Yes.” God then said: “I take you all as witness to this event; I also bear witness with you.”
“Whoever (any Prophet or his followers, who have been exposed to this covenant) turns away from this covenant is, therefore, of evil nature.” 
Are they looking for other than God’s religion knowing that everything in the heavens and the earth (willingly or unwillingly) submit themselves to God [this phrase in Arabic is expressed in one word: Islam] and will [eventually] be returned to Him [for the evaluation of their performance.]? 
Say: “We (Muslims) believe in God and whatever He has revealed to us as well as whatever He has revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Patriarchs, Moses, Jesus and all other Prophets. We do not prefer none of them over the others [and respect them equally]; and we submit ourselves to God [in Arabic it will be expressed: We are Muslims.]” 
If someone chooses any other religion than Islam (Submission to God), he will be considered as disbelievers and will find himself among the losers in the Hereafter. 
Do you really expect that God should guide those people who have rejected the faith, after being exposed to so many undeniable miracles, knowing that their Prophet is a true one? No way; God does not guide such wicked people. 
Such wicked people’s earning is nothing but the curse of God, the Angles and all other people. 
They will stay in the Hell forever. Their punishment will not be reduced and God will not look at them. 
The exceptions are those who [sincerely] repent now and choose righteousness; indeed God is the Most Forgiving and Merciful. 
As to those who reject the faith after the belief, then plunge deeper into disbelief, their [eventual] repentance will not be accepted from them. They are indeed unjust [to themselves.] 
As to those who return back to disbelief and die in the state of disbelief, they have earned an awful punishment. Even if they offer an earth full of gold, their offering will not be accepted and they will find themselves without any helper. 
you cannot attain the righteousness without sacrificing the things that you love the most [to please the Lord.] and God is aware of whatever you sacrifice [for the sake of His pleasure.] 
All lawful food [in Islam] was also lawful for the children of Israel (Jacob) but Israel prohibited some of them for himself [and this tradition lasted] until the revelation of Torah [to Moses clarifying what is lawful and what is not lawful as far as God is concerned.] Tell them to study their laws first [before arguing about why such and such food which is unlawful in Judaism has been made lawful in Islam.]
Now those who fabricate something [in support of their argument], and say that it is the word of God, they are indeed the most unjust [to their own soul.] 
Say: “God speaks the truth; follow the religion of Abraham (Islam); he was consistent in faith and never worshipped any other [false] deity. 
The first house dedicated to the worship of God [by Abraham] is [still standing] in Mecca; a blessed place [by God] for the guidance of people at large. 
In Mecca there are clear signs [of the Lord’s will to keep this cite as the center of His worship.] You will find there a spot where Abraham used to worship. God has made Mecca a sanctuary; whoever enters there, will find safety and security (even during the dark ages of ignorance no body dared to disturb the peace of Mecca and any attack was dismantled even before being started.) Know that it is your obligation to God to visit this place for His worship, if you have the economic mean to travel there. The one who disobeys this commandment should know that God is self sufficient and not in need of anybody’s obedience [and disobedience of God is the person’s loss.] 
Say to those who believe in the Scripture: “Why do you choose to disbelieve in these revelations of your Lord [which is in accordance with your belief]? Do you not realize that God sees whatever you do [and hold you responsible for your disbelief]?” 
Say to those who believe in the Scripture: “Why do you stand in the way of the people who seek [the truth in] the revelations of God and want them to follow your crooked way while you know the truth (about the authenticity of Qur’an and the fabrication of the existing Scriptures)? Know that God is never unaware of what you are doing. 
A warning to the believers: Know that your following some of the people of Scripture, will lead you to unbelief. 
Why should you then turn into disbelief when God’s revelations has been recited to you and that His Prophet is among you? The one who puts his trust in God will definitely be guided to the Right Way. 
O you who have chosen to believe; respect the Lord the way He deserves to be respected (with the utmost respect;) and do not die unless your are a Muslim (in Arabic meaning: In the state of submission to God.) 
Hold fast to the rope [that God has sent you as a mean of rescue] and do not be divided [adhering yourselves to such an such sect, nationality, culture, etc.] Be grateful to God who put the feeling of brotherhood in your heart while you were enemies and saved you while you were at the brink of Hellfire. See how clearly God make his revelations to you; may you [choose to] be guided.
Let there arise out of you a nation who invite each other to good deeds and remind each other of the consequences of wickedness. Such nation alone will attain the success. 
Do not be like previous nations who divided among themselves after having received the clear revelations of God (ordering unity among themselves); indeed they deserve a severe punishment awaiting them. 
On the Day that some faces will be bright (and glowing with joy) and some faces dark (out of sorrow), the laters will be said: “Do you remember to have chosen the disbelief after the belief? Suffer then the punishment of your choice.” 
[On the contrary,] Those whose face will be lit up, they will be in the [kingdom of] God’s mercy and will live there forever. 
These are the words of God revealed to you in truth; God does not mean any injustice to none of His creatures. 
Whatever there is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God and eventually they will all return to Him. 
You (Mohammad and his followers) are the best community ever appeared among the mankind as you invite people to do good, forbid them of evil deeds and believe in God. If the people of the Scripture would also believe in God, it would be good for them. Some of them believe but most of them are the sinners. 
They can never seriously harm you. At most they may harm you a little bit. If the war is declared between you, they will turn away and flee. Rest assured that they are helpless (lions made of the straw.) 
For the simple reason that they have turned their backs to the revelations of God, and have gone so far as to kill the Lord’s Prophets, they are cursed by God. Consequently, they will be disgraced and humiliated whenever they face you unless they uphold God’s covenant as well as respect their peace treaty with you. A little bit security that they may enjoy is not earned by them but has been the result of the help and kindness of others (American help in case of Israel, for instance.) 
Not all of the followers of the Scripture are alike. Among them there are righteous ones who devote their sleeping time at night to the recitation of the Scripture and worship the Lord in prostration.
The latter believe in God and the Day of the Resurrection. They invite people to do good, forbid them of evil deeds and rush to participate in good deeds. Such people are indeed the righteous ones. 
All their good deeds will be accepted by God. God is fully aware of (and rewards) the righteous. 
Those who choose the disbelief, on the contrary, will not find their wealth and children of any help in the court of God. They will end up in the Hellfire and have to bear it for the eternity. 
Their accomplishments in this world will be wiped out like a harvest scattered by a strong windstorm. God never means to harm them; it is them who are unjust to their own souls. 
The believers should not take as intimate friend those who do not think like themselves. The tongue of these outsiders have already declared their hatred towards your style of life (refer to the interviews of their leaders openly published in the Western media); imagine how stronger of hate they keep in their heart towards your belief. God is thus clearly warning you; may you use your brain. 
You extend your love towards them out of your belief in their (original/ lost) Scripture. They , on the contrary, seek a common ground with you at your presence and bite their fingers out of rage at your absence [as they cannot beat you in argument]! Say to them: “Die in your rage.” [They can not hide their wicked attitude from the Lord as] God is aware of the most innermost thoughts of every one. 
When something good happens to you, they become jealous and when you are in trouble they rejoice. If you continue your righteous way of life, their schemes cannot hurt you as God is aware of what they do [and will protect you accordingly.] 
Recall when you (Mohammad) left your household early in the morning and began to assign to the Muslims their positions on the battlefield. Indeed God hears everything and knows everything. 
Two troops of yours (the one of Banu Salmah & Banu Harithah) were about to show cowardice (when Abdulllah bin Ubayy, the hypocrite, and his troop left the battlefield) not believing that God is present to help them. [This was a lesson so that] The believers should always put their trust in God [even though the odds seems against them.]
Already God saved you in the [previous] battle of Badre when you were in absolute desperation [ill prepared men versus a well prepared army of 3000]; therefore, be grateful and have the utmost respect to God. 
Remember when you [tried to lift their moral by saying:] “[Why do you worry?] Does 3,angels that God is going to send to help you is not enough?” 
Yes; if you show patience and remember the Lord (and obey Him) in whatever you do, God will help you [not with 3,but] with 5,angels with certain marks [so that you may recognize them.] 
God has told you this in order to make you happy and secure. Know that the help does not come but from God; the Most Great, the Most Wise. 
[God will help you] so that He may destroy a group of the disbelievers or to expose them and leave them alone, disappointed in their disgrace. 
You (Mohammad) are not in charge of anything. It is up to God alone to decide to either forgive them or punish them for them so unjust. 
To God belongs everything that exists in the heavens and on earth. He may forgive whoever He decides and punish whoever He wishes; and God is Forgiving and Merciful. 
O believers; give up the devouring of interest and increasing your money in that way. Fear God [and obey Him in this matter] so that you may succeed. 
And fear the Hellfire which is prepared for the disbelievers (those who disobey God.) 
And obey God and His Prophet; may you will be shown mercy. 
Rush towards the path which will lead to your Lord’s forgiveness and to the Gardens of Paradise which is as vast as the heavens and the earth and has been prepared for those who respect (and obey) their Lord. 
The latter are those who spend generously on charitable causes, no matter how rich or poor they are, control their anger and forgive the shortcomings of the others. Indeed God loves such graceful people. 
As to those who have committed indecencies or have been unjust to their own soul, they better immediately recourse to God and ask forgiveness for their sins and unintentional persistence in their wrongdoings. Who else but God can forgive the sins?
Such people’s reward will be God’s forgiveness and the Gardens beneath which water flow. They will stay there forever; how wonderful is the reward of those who do good deeds. 
As to those who turned their back [to the revelations of God and chose the disobedience] you may see their miserable end for yourselves by traveling on earth [and passing through their ruins.] 
These verses are being mentioned to be an admonition and a guidance for those who have the utmost respect for God. 
Do not loose faith and do not be depressed [in hardships]; if you be true believers, you will surely gain the upper hand [over your enemies.] 
[Do not forget that] If you are wounded [in the battle of Ohud], the enemy has got wounds too. Know that God alternates the days of victory and defeat in order to see who the true believers are. God also blesses some with martyrdom. God does not like the unjust people. 
God [through hardship] separates true believers from the disbelievers. 
Do you really think that you will go to the Paradise without [passing successfully through the hardship and] proving to the Lord that you are firm (patient in dealing with difficulties) and devoted to the cause of God? 
You were wishing for the death (martyrdom) and now you saw it with your own eyes [in this battle and realize that it is not an easy honor to earn.] 
Mohammad is only a [human being chosen to be a] Prophet [of God]: many prophets have already passed before him. Should he die or be killed [in the battlefield,] would you desert your ranks? Anyone who turns back does not hurt God in the least. God rewards only those who are thankful [that their Lord has guided them to the right path and show their gratefulness by action.] 
No one will die without the Lord’s permission and it is [pre-determined and] written in a book. Those who ask for the vanities of this world will get it and those who ask for the rewards of the Hereafter will be blessed therein. I reward those who are thankful. 
Many Prophets and their followers fought with a firm belief for the cause of God. They never hesitated or became discouraged. God loves such believers who stand firm and never give up. 
Their only prayer was: “Lord, forgive our sins and shortcomings, give us firmness and help us to defeat the disbelievers.”
God [heard them and] gave them the best in this world and a reward in Hereafter. Indeed God loves the graceful people. 
The believer should know that if they obey the disbelievers, the latter will tempt them to retreat and end up losers. 
Know that God is your Lord and He is the best of Helpers. 
Pretty soon I (God) will cast terror in the heart of those who reject the truth, in account of their elevating the others to the level of God for no reason. Their destiny is Hell. What a miserable place for the unjust people to end up in. 
God indeed fulfilled His promise to give you victory [in the battle of ohud), giving you the upper hand at the beginning. It was you who disobeyed [the order of Commander Mohammad] and started a dispute among yourselves [and left your positions in order to secure your share of the confiscated materials.] Among you, there are those who are in love with this materialistic world and those who care about their Hereafter. Thus you were tried [to find out for yourself who fights for the acquisition of wealth and who fights for the cause of God.] That is how you lost and had to retreat. The Lord, however, forgave you as He is the most gracious to the believers. 
You were so afraid that your only concern was to flee, by climbing the mountain, without paying any attention to the Prophet who was calling you back. God then made you to worry about so many things [such as the possibility of your town being destroyed by the victorious army (outnumbering the population of the town), the loss of your fighting companions, the rumor of the death of the Prophet, etc.] so that you may learn a lesson and not to grieve for a loss in the future. Know that God is fully aware of what you are doing. 
After the ordeal, God blessed some of you (who had shown courage) with such peace that made you drowsy. The others (who did not deserve peace) started to entertain the evil thoughts of the days of ignorance, asking why they do not have any saying in their destiny. Let them know that it is God who determines people’s destiny. In their privacy they think: “If it was up to us, none of us would have died.” Let them know that [a person’s death is not due to the fact that he has been present in the battle ground and that] they would have met the death in their bed, if they had been destined to die. God thus puts you to the test to show you how strong your faith is. God is fully aware of the innermost thoughts of yours. 
Those among you who fled the battle ground were let to be possessed by Satan in account of some of their misdeeds. God, however, forgave them as He is the most forgiving, the Most Tolerant.
O you who have believed; do not adopt the disbelievers’ attitude. The latter say to their kinsmen (who prepare themselves to go on battle grounds): “If they (the previous wars’ martyrs) had stayed with us, they would not have been killed” God will make it a disappointment for them [that their “advice” is not being listened] Know that life and death is at the disposition of God and He sees everything that you do. 
If you get killed or die in the cause of God, you will receive God’s forgiveness and reward which is much better than the disbelievers’ materialistic earnings in this world. 
If you get killed or die in the cause of God, what a pleasure better than being escorted to the presence of the Lord Almighty? 
It is a blessing of God that you (Mohammad) are a gentleman. If you were a harsh commander, your followers would have abandoned you. So, forgive their shortcomings and consult with them in the State’s affair. When you all come to a decision, stick with it and put your trust in God. God loves those who put their trust in Him. 
If God supports you, none can defeat you. If God [for some reason] abandons you, who else can help you? Therefore, in God the believers should trust. 
Even the Prophet of God may not abuse what he is being trusted with [and take more than his fair share of the confiscated materials in the war.] Those who act unfaithfully have to answer their Lord on the Day of resurrection; the Day on which every soul will receive what it has earned and none will be dealt unjustly. 
Is the man who seeks the pleasure of the Lord equal to the one who provokes the anger of God? The latter destiny. What an evil destination. 
There are different degrees [of grace and evil] that people earn. God sees everything [and rank people accordingly.] 
Indeed God has blessed the believers by appointing a Prophet from among themselves to recite His revelations, purify them and teach them the Scripture and wisdom; they were in absolute ignorance. 
Now that you have suffered a set back you wonder why? Did you not make the enemy suffer twice as much (in the previous battle of Badr the Muslims killed disbelievers and got prisoners; in this battle of Ohud they suffered casualties)? Let them know that their failure is their own fault [who did not obey the order of Commander Mohammad; it is not the fault of God as] God is the Most Powerful.
What happened to you in [the confusion of] the clash between two armies [which led to your defeat in the battle of Ohud] was with the permission of God, and as a trial, in order to expose the hypocrites [Muslim by name.] 
When the hypocrites were told: “Come fight in the way of God or [at least] for your defense,” they replied: “We would have joined you, if we knew how to fight!” They were much closer to disbelief than belief on that day. Their lip service does not reveal their belief; indeed God knows what they hide inside. 
When they talk about their [martyr] kinsmen, they say: “If they had listened to us and stayed behind, they would not have been killed.” Tell them (Mohammad): “If you are so smart [and know how to prevent the death,] then avoid your own death.” 
Never consider the martyrs as dead; they are indeed alive and get [a non-interrupting provision and] reward from their Lord. 
They are enjoying the audience of their Lord and they would like to inform their comrades [who did not achieve the martyrdom in the cause of God] that they should fear nothing and that they should never let depression overcome them. 
They are enjoying God’s blessings and grace. Know that God never fails to reward the [good deeds] of the believers. 
As to those who responded to the call of God and His Prophet and showed courage, in spite of their wounds [in the battle of Ohud,] and continue to be righteous and respect their Lord, there is a great reward for them in reserve. 
When [the 5th column tried to frighten them and] they were told that: “A mighty army is gathering against you,” they replied: “God is enough for us as protector and we put our trust in His Most Excellency”; thus, [in account of their attitude] they attained a higher level of the belief. 
They returned gracefully back with no harm. God was pleased with them and God’s bounty is limitless. 
It is the devil who wants you to fear his allies. Do not fear them. Fear only Me (God), if you are a true believer. 
Never let those who conveniently choose the disbelief to put you down. They can not harm the Lord the least. It is the intention of God to give them nothing good in the Hereafter and submit them to a miserable punishment. 
Those who trade off their belief for disbelief, are indeed buying the Lord’s painful punishment. 
The disbelievers are wrong in thinking that I have left them alone for their own good. On the contrary, they are left alone [and deprived of guidance] so that they increasingly engage in sins and deserve their terrible punishment.
God will not take you to a higher level until you go through your trials and the good is separated from the wicked. Also, God will not reveal the secrets of the world of unseen except to those of His Messenger that He decides to give such knowledge. If you believe in God and His Prophet, do good deeds and avoid the evil, yours will be a great reward. 
It is not very smart of those who [passionately] hold on to what God has [generously] given them [and do not spend nothing out of it on charity.] On the Day of Judgment, they have to carry the heavy burden of what they hoard around their neck. God is the One Who will eventually take back whatever is in the heavens and on earth and He is totally aware of what you are doing. 
God indeed heard those [Jews] who jokingly said: “God is poor and we are rich.” I have recorded their saying and their [evil deeds such as] killing My Prophet for the simple reason that they were defending the truth. [In the Day of Judgment,] I will tell them: “Taste the punishment of the Fire.” 
“This is what you have earned.” God will never show any injustice to those who serve him. 
They (the Jews) also say: “God has asked us not to believe in any Prophet unless his sacrifice is being struck with a thunder from the heaven.” Tell them: “If it is so, then why did you kill the previous Prophets who performed such a miracle (refer to the case of Prophet Elijah in I Kings, 18-19)?” 
Never mind, If they (those who adhere to Scripture) reject you; they rejected many Prophets before you who came with undeniable miracles and brought Psalm and enlightening Scriptures. 
Every soul will taste the death. It is only on the Day of Resurrection that you will get your reward (the real life in Paradise.) Only those who are saved from the Fire and admitted to the Gardens of Paradise, have attained the main objective of life. As to this worldly life, it is nothing but an illusion and deceptive vanities. 
You will be tried through your wealth and your life. You will be called names by the followers of the previous Scriptures as well as idol worshippers. But if you stand firm and lead a righteous life, you have used the means for success. 
Recall that God took a covenant from the followers of the Scripture that they should not hide the truth and that they should spread it [Deuteronomy (4:2), (6:7-9). Unfortunately they broke their promise [up to the point that years after Moses they did not know that there was such book known as Torah (see II Kings, 22:8-13)] and traded their faith for a hand full of money. What a loss their deal was.
Those who pretend that they are engaged in good deeds and like to be praised for what they have not done [refer to the above mentioned covenant] will not escape the punishment. . The fact is that a terrible punishment is waiting for them. 
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and He is capable of doing whatever He desires. 
Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alteration of night and day there are many thought provoking issues for those who use their brains. 
[At awe with cosmos,] They talk to God standing, sitting and lying down and say: “Lord, you have not created this awesome universe in vain; praise the Lord. May you save us from the torment of the Hellfire.” 
“Lord, you surely have humiliated the one whom you cast into the Hellfire; indeed those who have been unjust to their soul have no one to help them.” 
“Lord, we heard someone inviting us to choose the faith. We accepted his invitation. Now; kindly forgive our sins, cover our wrong deeds and include us among the righteous people.” 
“Lord, grant us what you promised to your Prophets and do not put us to the shame on the Day of Resurrection; you never renege your promise.” 
The response of their lord [to such prayers] was: “ I never let go to waste any good deed of yours, male or female alike; you are all equal in My Sight as human beings. I will, therefore forgive the shortcomings of those who were expelled from their homes, left their homes for my sake or were persecuted [in account of their belief.] I will admit them to the Gardens where canals flow underneath.” Such is the Lord’s reward and none can reward as generously as God. 
Do not be impressed with the apparent success of the disbelievers. 
Their success is short in nature and their destiny is Hell which is a horrible place to end in. 
As to those who have the utmost respect for their Lord, they will end up in the Gardens where water flows underneath. They will live there forever. Such is the hospitality of God and what God grants is the best. 
Among the followers of the Scripture there are some who believe in God, the previous revelations and what is revealed to you. They have the utmost respect for the Lord and do not trade his revelations for a hand full of money. They will also have their reward as God’s judgment will come pretty soon. 
O’ you who have chosen to believe, stand firm, be patient, be ready [to carry out your Godly mission] and have the utmost respect towards your Lord; may you be successful. 

Hand over to the orphans their inheritance. Do not exchange your lower quality commodities with their belongings and do not devour their properties; this is certainly a great crime. 
An if your common properties are mixed up in such a way that it is difficult to distinguish what belongs to who, then you may marry them (or their mothers) up to four woman at a time, if such an arrangement reduces your financial burden. 
Give your wives their dowries, as well as whatever you have promised them at the moment of wedding. If they want to make it (or a part of it) a gift for you, enjoy it and be thankful to them. 
Do not give immature (and crazy) orphans their properties which God has entrusted with you as guardians; feed and cloth them from it and treat them kindly to please your Lord. 
When the orphans (to whom you are appointed as a guardian) reach puberty, see if they have a sound sense of judgment. If they pass your test, give them back their inheritance. If you have to use the orphans’ properties for their maintenance, do not be extravagant. The rich guardians (in order to please God) should not charge any wage for their upbringing; the poor guardians, however, may charge a just wage. When it is time to hand over their inheritance, take God as a witness for the accomplishment of your duty; God is, indeed, the best witness. 
Inheritance is not just for men. Women also have a right to inheritance no matter how large or small their relatives have left behind for them. 
When the inheritance is being distributed, give something to the relatives, orphans and the needy ones who are present and be nice to them.
If you are concerned about what will happen to your own children after your death, have the same concern about those whom you are appointed as guardian too. Be mindful of God and be equitable for his sake. 
The guardians who “eat up” an orphan’s property, will eat nothing but fire in Hell. 
Good, hereby, decrees the best way of distributing the inheritance: First the deceased debts should be paid. Then the deceased will (limited up to 1/3rd of the inheritance) should be fulfilled. The sons will inherit twice as much as the daughters. If there is only one daughter (no son) left, she will receive half of the inheritance. If there are more than one daughter (and no son) they will receive 2/3rd of the inheritance together. The parents of the deceased will get each 1/6th of what the deceased one has left behind (if there is a child); if there is no children involved and the parents are the only inheritors, the mother of the deceased will inherit 1/3rd of what is left behind, if the deceased dos not have a brother. If there is a brother involved, the mother then will get 1/6th.You can not decide who is dearer to you: your children or your parents. God is his Wisdom has decided the inheritance being divided in this way. This is God’s law, He is the Most Knowledgeable and Wise. 
If a woman dies, her debt should be paid and her wishes (up to 1/3rd of what she leaves behind) should be honored. The husband, then will inherit half of what the wife leaves behind, if she does not have any children. If she has any children, the husband then will get 1/4th of the inheritance. The wife will get 1/4th of what man leaves behind, if there is no children. If there are children involved, the wives will get 1/8th of what is left behind. If a man or woman leaves a property to be inherited, by neither parents nor off springs, and he/she has a brother or sister, each will receive 1/6ht but if there are more than two brothers or sisters, they will share 1/3rd. This is God’s law; God is indeed the Most Knowledgeable and Generous. 
The above mentioned are the laws of God. Whoever obeys God and His messenger will end up in paradise where rivers flow in its gardens. This is indeed “real” achievement. 
Those who disobey God and his messenger [including those who write the “modern” laws which do not correspond to God’s laws] will end up in Hell to live in (forever) and be punished by its fire. This is indeed the worse painful punishment. 
If any of your women have committed the adultery, you have to gather four witness to testify against them. If they do bear witness, then you should keep them under house arrest [not only as a punishment but to prevent them to see the other people and spread indecency in the society] for lifetime; or until God out of him mercy purify them.
As far as two among you [man &amp; man or man &amp; woman or woman &amp; woman] found guilty of indecency, punish them. If they repent, leave them alone as God is the Most Merciful and He accepts people’s repentance.
Bear in mind that God accepts repentance only from those who have committed indecencies out of ignorance and are sincere in promising not to repeat it as God is Knowing and Wise. 
Repentance is not accepted from those who persist in committing sins and use their last breath asking for forgiveness [like Pharaoh who said I submit myself to God while he was being drowned in the Red Sea]. Repentance is not accepted of those who die while not believing in God; I God) have prepared a painful punishment for the latter.
O you believers, do not take your women’s inheritance (and their belongings) from them. Unless your women have committed a big sin, it is forbidden for you to treat them badly so that they give up and sign up their wealth to you. Treat your women kindly and try not to dislike them; you may grow to dislike a woman [because her appearance is not like a TV model] while God may have showered her with so much beauty inside. 
But if you fail to love your existing wife and have decided to marry another one instead, then do not take back anything that you have given her even though it is a big fortune. Do not recourse to slander or harshness to take your wife’s belonging. 
How can you even think about doing such a wrong thing when you offered her (whatever you offered as gift) with the most strong promise during the wedding? 
It is a sin to marry your father’s ex-wife (a shameful and disgusting tradition of the days of ignorance) unless it has happened before the revelation of this law. 
The following women are to close for you to marry them: your mothers, daughters, sisters, father’s sister, mother’s sister, brother’s daughter, sister’s daughter, foster mother (who breast fed you) and their daughter, mother in law, step daughter (under your guardianship), step daughters (unless you divorced their mother before having sex with them), ex-wife of your biological sons. It is also forbidden for you to marry two sisters at the same time unless it has happened before the revelation of this law as God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
It is also against God’s law to marry married women, unless they have fled the tyranny of their disbeliever husbands who are at war with you. Apart from the above mentioned ones, you may engage in marriage (and not consenting adult sex) contract, with any other woman as long as you mutually agree upon a gift (or a sum) upon the wedding; if you mutually decide later to renegotiate this sum, you may do so as God is the Knowing and the Wise.
Those who do not have the mean to marry properly, may, then, marry a believing woman whom his right hand possess (a slave woman or the one who does not have materialistic concerns) as you are all equal in God’s eyes. Wed the latter with the consent of their owners/ guardians promising them a “reasonable” sum. They should behave accordingly and avoid adultery or taking secret lovers. If they commit an indecency, their punishment shall be half of the one prescribed for a free woman. Marrying to a slave woman is the last resort and patience is better for you. God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
It is God’s desire to explain the things for you by referring to its precedents; thus guide you to the way of those before you who were on the right path as God accepted their repentance. God is Knowledgeable and the Most Wise. 
God’s wishes to free you from the consequences of your ignorance. Those who follow their lust and vain desires, on the contrary, wish to turn you far away from God; far away. 
God wants to give you a brake in account of your weaknesses in creation 
O you who chosen to believe, do not spend your resources in an extravagant manner to impress each other; use it instead for promoting businesses by mutual good-will. [While talking about extravagances and going to the extreme measures,] do not kill each other: How Merciful is God to you [who takes time to explain all these things]. 
Whoever commits these sins will be condemned to live in Hell and this is easy for God to fulfill His promise 
If you avoid the great sins, I will forgive your violating my laws and command I will admit you into paradise; the most honorable admission. 
You should not be jealous of each one’s faculties [and engage in power games]. Men are given certain faculties, women are given certain faculties. Instead of envies pray God for His blessings; God has knowledge over everything. 
For everyone your Lord has precisely specified a share out of what your near one leave after death. Obey God and let everyone who is entitled get his/ her fair share. God is watching.
Men are put in charge of women; that is because, God has simply decided to provide them with faculties which facilitate this task of them and also that they spend out of their resources for their wives’ maintenance. The righteous women would gladly accept this division of the task as it is God’s commandment. They will therefore keep vigilance on their husband’s honor and belonging in their absence. As far as those women who rebel this commandment of their Lord, first try to reason with them and advise them of the consequence of rebelling against their Creator. If they do not submit them, punish them by separating your bedroom. As a last resort, you may beat them [not in a violent manner]. If they come to their senses, be nice to them; God is the Highest and the Greatest 
If you reach to the point that separation is eminent, chose a referee from the man’s part and a referee from the woman’s part so that they negotiate the ways that the marriage may be saved. If they both desire [at the bottom of their heart] a reconciliation, God will bring them together as God is Knowing and Aware. 
And worship none but God and raise none to His Divine level. Show kindness to and help your parents, the relatives, the orphans, the needy ones, the neighbors (related or non related to you, the stranded traveler and your slaves. Know that God does not like the arrogant show-offs who are stingy, reproach people for being charitable and hoard what God has blessed them out of His kindness. 
Indeed God has an awful punishment for such people who try to cover the truth. 
Such people have chosen the worst friend for themselves, i.e. Satan. They do not believe in God and the day of judgment and their participation in charity is just a show-off. 
What harm would have come upon them, if they had chosen to believe in God and the Last Day and spent in charity out of what God had given them [at first place]? Do they not understand that God is totally aware of what they do? 
God does not do an atom weight’s of injustice to nobody. On the contrary, He raises your good deeds to heaven and rewards you generously. 
When the Day [of Judgment] comes, I (God) will summon a person from each nation to serve as a witness (for what they were doing) and will summon you (Mohammad) to be a witness for [the behavior] these people. 
On that Day, those who chose the [convenience of] disbelief and disobeyed the Prophet of God, will [be so ashamed that they will] wish they were level with earth as all their [shameful] words [and action] will be publicly displayed.
O’ you who believe, do not worship God while you are intoxicated [this is the first out of four verses that gradually prohibited the intoxication] so that you know what you are saying. Nor after sexual contact without bathing. If you are sick [and can not take a bath], traveling, have relieved yourself [have urinated, passed gas or defecated] and had sex with a woman and cannot find water, then touch clean soil and wipe of your hands and face; surely God [understands, makes it easy for your and] forgives and pardons [your shortcomings.] 
Have you ever noticed how those who have received only a portion of the Lord’s Book have chosen the darkness [at the cost of giving up a God pleasing way of life] and wish you were following them too? {This verse clearly applies to our modern time where the Western societies have tossed the Scriptures away, chosen a “secular” way of life and wish the Muslim follow them too.} 
God is fully aware of their hostile intentions. If you put your trust in God, You have chosen the Best Help [against your enemies’ ill intentions.] 
Among those who (have changed their name from “Submitters” [in Arabic = Islam] long after Prophet Abraham and ) call themselves “Jews”, there are some who twist the Arabic words and quote them out of their context [to change their true meanings] in order to make fun. If they had said “We hear and obey” instead of “We hear and do not obey”, “We hear you” instead of “Your words are falling over our deaf ears” or “Watch over us” instead of “Be our shepherd”, it would have been much proper and constructive for them. However, as they have earned God’s disenchantment, there is less hope for them to be guided toward the belief. 
God, hereby, is calling upon the people of the Scriptures to believe in this Book, sent down now, which confirms [the divine source of the existing] Scriptures. They better do so, before God changes the faces and the fames of some of them beyond all recognition or lay a curse on them the same way that He dealt with those who did not obey His Law of the Sabbath. Know that the decision of God must be carried out. 
God will never forgives the one who raises someone or something to His Divine level. Apart from this sin, God may forgive whoever He wants. The one who worships the idols [in any form or shape] has committed the worse possible sin.
Have you ever noticed how some people speak very highly of their own purity? Do they not realize that only God purifies those whom He decides to? They deserve it (to be purified or not to be purified) as God does not commit the least injustice. 
See how they fabricate lies about God (by saying that they are chosen and blessed by God). This sine is enough to show what kind of sinners they are. 
Have you noticed how those who have got only a portion of the Divine Book believe in sorcery and magic? Such people then declare that disbelievers are better than the believers (The Jewish rabies had declared that the idol worshippers of the time were better than the Muslims!) 
[Just for making such an unjust statement,] they have indeed earned the condemnation of God and those who are cursed by God can never find any one to help them. 
Have they have any share in the Kingdom? [Indeed not for the simple reason that:] If they had any, they would have not shared an atom weight of it with the others. 
Why are they so jealous that God has showered other people (Mohammad and the Muslims) with His blessings [thus showing their racist attitude]? Did not God bless [them] the descendants of Abraham with the Scripture, wisdom and a great kingdom? 
Some of them have believed [in God’s revelations in Qur’an] and the rest turned their back. The Hellfire is enough of a punishment for the latter. 
Those who reject My revelations will soon be cast into the Fire [and stay there long enough till] their skins completely burn. They will then grow a new layer of skin to be subject to the same torture [again and again.] God is indeed Almighty and the Most Wise [and knows what He is doing.] 
As to those who choose to believe and do good deeds, they will be admitted into the Gardens [of Paradise] beneath which the canals flow and they will live therein forever. They will have pure wives and enjoy the pleasant shades [of its trees.] 
God hereby orders you to return what people have trusted you with back to them. If you have to judge in a case, do with the utmost justice. See how excellent the teachings of the Lord are. Never forget that God hears [whatever you say] and sees [whatever you do.] 
O you who have chosen to believe, obey the Lord, His Prophet and your [righteous] leaders. If there is any disagreement, turn to God [and His revelations in Qur’an as a source of reference] and His Prophet [as long as he is among you.] Theses [sources of references] are the best (compared to the man made laws) for those who believe in God and the Day of Judgment.
Have you noticed how those [hypocrites] who pretend that they believe in what is revealed to you, as well as the followers of the Scripture, refer to other evil sources [such as man made laws] to settle down their disputes? They do so in spite of being ordered that they must follow the Divine laws. They have indeed submitted themselves to Satan and are lost beyond any hope to return. 
When they are invited to return to the Divine laws and His Prophet’s judgment, they manifest their hostility. 
When they are afflicted by a distress, caused by their own deeds, they come to you swear by God that [by not obeying the Lord’s laws and referring to none-Devine source of references] they had the best intention of the world! 
God exactly knows what their true belief is. Keep distance from them but continue inviting them to the right path may they be guided. 
God has sent His Prophets to be obeyed [and not be put aside and treated like a ceremonial person that should only be respected.] After all, the Prophets represent the will of the Lord. If the unjust people had sought the forgiveness of the Lord and, the Prophet, too, had begged the Lord to forgive them, they would have found God the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
Never indeed, by your Lord; they can never be a true believer until the submit their disputes to your judgment, do not resent it and accept it full heartedly. 
If I had asked them to put their lives in line for the cause of God or leave their homes to participate in a God pleasing mission, only a few would have obeyed in spite of the fact that obeying the Lord’s orders is the best for them as it will make them stronger people. 
[If they had obeyed,] I would have certainly given them a great reward. 
And would have guided them to the right path. 
The one who obeys God and follows the Prophet will find himself among those whom God has showered with His favors and blessings, i.e., the Prophets, the truthful ones, martyrs and the righteous ones; what a wonderful fellowship. 
Such is the generosity of God. [It does not matter if no one is aware of your good deeds as] God alone suffice as knower. 
O you who have chosen to believe; [now that all your enemies try to harm you after your defeat at Ohud,] be alert and go in missions in group or [in case of hostility,] march as a body.
Surely among you there are hypocrites who will [not join you in your campaigns and] stay behind. If a misfortune happens to you, they will say: “How kind of God not letting us to join them.” 
If, on the contrary, you gain something in your campaigns, they will [become jealous and] say (in a hostile manner): “What a pity that we did not join them to take advantage of their victory!” 
Those who sincerely fight in the cause of God, they trade the pleasures of this world to the pleasures of Hereafter. Whether they die in their campaign or come out victorious, there is a great reward in reserve for them. 
How is it possible that one refrain from fighting in the cause of God while hearing that the helpless and oppressed men, women and children [who can not migrate to the only safe island for Muslims, i.e., Medina at the time and] implore God: “Lord, rescue us from these oppressors and send us a protector out of your grace.” 
Those who have chosen the belief, they are God’s soldiers. Those who have chosen the [convenience of] disbelief, they are [knowingly or unknowingly] the soldiers of the Evil. Thus, you should fight the army of the evil, keeping in mind that the Satan’s strategy is weak. 
Remember how in the past you were not allowed to fight back and were ordered just to worship God and engage in charitable actions. As soon as you were permitted to defend yourselves, some feared mankind more than God and complained to their Lord saying: “Why have you put this burden of fighting [and being killed] upon us? Could you not give us a break?” Say: “This world is too short compared to Hereafter. Besides, God will never treat the righteous ones with the least injustice [and will reward you generously if you become a martyr in the battle field.] 
Know that wherever you are (even in a fortified castle,) you will meet the death, when the time comes. It is funny how the hypocrites thank God for good fortunes of life and blame His Prophet for their misfortune. Let them know that everything is from God. What is wrong with this people who do not get it? 
Any good thing that happens to you is by the grace of God. As to your misfortune [most of them] is the repercussion of your own deeds. I have sent you (Mohammad) as a Prophet and who else better than God Himself can testify for your prophet hood? 
Whoever obeys the Prophet, has obeyed God [for the simple reason that he carries the orders of God]. As to those who disobey you (Mohammad), never mind them as you are not responsible for their deeds [and attitudes.]
They pledge obedience to God at your presence; but as soon as they leave, some of them entertain other thoughts. God indeed registers their hostile intentions. Be firm with them and put your trust in God Who is the best Protector. 
Why do they not study the Qur’an? If it was the words of other than God, they would have found many contradiction in it. 
When a matter of security arises, they look for a solution elsewhere out of fear [the same way that today’s people look to other than Qur’an for a solution to their “civil” issues]. If they had come to you or their leaders, they would have found the best solution. If it was not for the Grace of your Lord, most of you have been misled by the Satan. 
Fight for the cause of God. You (Mohammad, as well as any body) are not responsible for any one else but yourself. Encourage the others [to join the fight.] May God neutralize the power of your disbeliever enemies. God is much more powerful [than anyone else in helping you] and has the highest hand in punishment [of the disbelievers.] 
The one who wishes the best [and engage in a good deed] will get a share from it and the one who entertains the evil thoughts [and participate in an evil deed], will be caught in its consequences. God oversees everything. 
When you are greeted in a courteous manner [by a Muslim or non-Muslim], your response should be at least equal, if not more courteous. God thus takes into consideration the least of your behavior. 
The Lord, Who is the only God, will gather you all together in the Day of Judgment. Do not have the least doubt about it; after all, who else better than God can inform you of the truth? 
Why some of you have pity on hypocrites? God has already put the stamp of His approval on their disbelief. Do you want to guide a person that God has already turned the light off on him? When God leaves someone in darkness, none can return him to the light. 
The hypocrites hope to see you join them in disbelief. Do not accept their friendship until they show their sincerity by leaving their homes [and belongings] behind and migrate to participate in the cause of God. Fight them all the way to death, when they challenge you, and do not take them as friends nor allies. 
Exempted are those who join the people with whom you have already signed a peace treaty as well as those who pledge not to fight with you nor their own people. If God had willed, He would have given them an upper hand against you. therefore, if they leave you alone, do not engage in animosity with you and extend their hands in peace to you, then God does not give you the permission to fight with them.
You will realize that some of them would like to please you as well as your enemies [and consequently will engage in any mischief when the opportunity knocks.] If such people do not stop animosity against you nor pledge peace nor stop fighting with you, then they deserve the capital punishment as God has authorized you. 
No believer should kill another believer intentionally. In case of unintentional man slaughter (such as car accident), the killer must set free a believing slave and pay blood money to the heirs unless the latter do not demand it to please God. If the believing victim lived among the enemies (and was killed say in a military campaign by mistake), the expiation will be freeing a believing slave. If the believing victim lived among the non-believers with whom you have a peace treaty, the expiation will be freeing a Muslim slave and the payment of the blood money to his heirs. If one (for monetary reasons) can not free a slave, then he has to fast two consecutive months and ask for forgiveness from God, the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise. 
As to a Muslim who kills another Muslim intentionally, his punishment will be the Hell where he will stay in forever. Such a criminal has earned the anger and the curse of the Lord and God will submit him to an awful punishment. 
If you leave for fight in the cause of God, you must make enough investigation [to be sure of the hostile intention of the enemy.] If you are greeted and received a peace offer, do not refuse it by abruptly saying: “You are disbelievers.” If you take such an attitude for the sake of making some money [by engaging in the war], remember that God can offer you more wealth [if you adopt righteousness.] Remember that you were in a similar (weak) situation and God blessed you with His grace. You must be absolutely sure [of the hostile intention of the enemy as well as your pure intention of fighting for the cause of God and not for making some fortune] before you strike keeping in mind that God is fully aware of what you are doing. 
Those who prefer the safety of their house are not equal to those who go to fight in the cause of God offering their wealth and lives. Those who sacrifice their lives and wealth earn a higher rank from their Lord. Although God has promised a good reward for all believers, those who fight for the sake of God will get a better reward than those who stay behind.
Those who fight for the cause of God are ranked higher, and will earn God’s forgiveness and mercy. God is indeed the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
When the angles take the should of those who [had compromised and in consequence] were unjust to their own souls, they will ask why did you do this to your own should. They will reply: “We did not have any other choice as we were under oppression.” The angles will reply: “Was the Lord’s earth not big enough to migrate and find another place [to live in accordance with the Lord’s laws?] Hell is where they will end up; what a terrible place to live in. 
Exempted are the weak men, women and children who did not have neither the means nor a guide to migrate. 
God may forgive them as He is Forgiving and Forbearing. 
The one who leaves his home [,belongings, friends and loved ones] behind and migrate to join the cause of God, will find many safe refuges [with ample provisions] in the Lord’s spacious earth. Now if he dies in account of obeying the Lord and His Prophet, a great reward for him will be in reserve with God. 
When you travel [either migrating or setting forth towards a military campaign], you may shorten your daily prayers, if you fear that your enemies may [take advantage of your devotion to worship the Lord and] attack you. Beware [and take all necessary precaution;] the disbelievers are your most vicious enemies. 
When you (Mohammad) stand to worship your Lord in the midst of a military campaign, let a party of your troops join you in prayer, with their arms besides. When they finish their prayers, put them on guard so that the others join you in worship. You may leave your arms apart if you are too sick [or injured] or the weather is too inclement (making it too difficult for you to carry the arm) as long as you remain alert. Beware that your enemies wish to take advantage of your slightest relaxation to finish you all up. Rest assured that God has prepared a disgraceful punishment for the disbelievers. 
When your congregational prayer is over, continue remembering your Lord all the time (whether standing, sitting or laying on bed.) When the emergency situation is over, say your regular daily prayers on time as these daily prayers are decreed for you as an obligation. 
Show no weakness in following up the enemy. If you are suffering a hardship (such as a wound of war), they also suffer. Besides, you expect a reward from your Lord while they do not hope for nothing. Indeed God is the Most Knowledgeable and the Most Wise.
I (God) have revealed this book to you (Mohammad, as well as all Muslims) so that you use it as a source of reference in your judgments [and establishing a God pleasing justice] between people. Therefore, do not be like the [previous] treacherous [who left the laws of the Lord aside and established their own convenient “civil” laws as dictated by Satan.] 
Implore God for forgiveness and bear in mind that He is Forgiver and Merciful. 
Do not ask your Lord to forgive those who [knowingly] have wronged their own soul as God does not love the sinful betrayers. 
These hypocrites may hide what is in their heart but God is aware of their plotting in the midst of night [against Islam.] God is fully aware of what they do. 
Here you are [innocently] asking God to forgive them. Who can they find in the Day of Judgment to plead on their behalf [when their unforgivable wrongdoings are publicly exposed]? 
If someone has been unjust to his own soul, or has done a wrong thing, and then beg God for forgiveness, he will find the Lord Most Forgiving and Merciful. 
Anyone who chooses to commits a sin, does it to the detriment of his own soul. Keep in mind that God knows everything and is the Most Wise. 
If someone makes a mistake and then blames an innocent one for that, then he has committed a big sin. 
If it were not for the Lord’s Grace and Mercy, the disbelievers could have changed your faith. They do not realize that their conspiracies lead to their further being misled and that they can not harm you the least [as you are protected by Go.] God has sent you this book and has blessed you with wisdom. He has taught you what you never knew before. Great indeed is God’s Grace on you. 
When a person murmurs in somebody’s ear [or a secret gathering is called for], usually nothing good comes out of it; except when he invites the person to righteousness, engagement in charity or making peace among the people. I (God) will give a great reward to the one who does so to please His Lord. 
If someone realizes the truth and then opposes the Prophet and adopts a way different from that of the believers, I (God) will push him in that wrong way chosen by him so that he ends up in the Hell; what a terrible place to end up in. 
The only unforgivable sin is believing in more than one God. God [at His discretion] may forgive any other sin. Anyone who idolizes beside God, has gone far into the darkness.
Those who worship goddesses, are indeed worshipping Satan; the rebellious one who is cursed by God. 
In response to God’s turning His back to Satan, he made a business of his to lead a good portion of men to the darkness. 
The Satan said: “I will mislead men, make them to fall into vain desires, create pagan rituals for them and entice them to change the nature of God’s creation [to invent unnatural behaviors such as homosexuality].” The one who takes Satan (and not God) as his guide, is a big time looser. 
Satan makes promises and excite people with vain desires which are nothing more than illusions. 
The followers of Satan will end up in Hell where there is no escape from. 
As to those who chose to believe and engaged in good deeds, they will enter the gardens under which water flows and live therein forever. Such is the truthful promise of God; after all, who else but God can be trusted to tell the truth? 
Anyone who does an evil will pay for it; this does not have to do anything with your wishful thoughts or those of the followers of the Scriptures. Rest assured that no one can save you from the punishment of God. 
Any man or woman who chooses to believe and do good deeds will go to the Paradise without any discrimination. 
Who may have a better religion than the one who entirely submits himself to the will of God, is a graceful person and follows the tradition of Abraham (the faithful one that God chose as His beloved friend)? 
Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to God and He is in absolute control. 
People will come to you asking about the way women should be dealt with. Say: “As it is recited in the book, be trustworthy in handling the wealth of the female orphans. If you decide to marry them, do not cheat them out of their dowries. Do not take advantage of them and take the weak and oppressed children under your protection. You must be fair in dealing with male orphans too. Be nice to the orphans and know that whatever good you do, God is aware of it.” 
If a woman feels being mistreated or not loved by her husband, [she should speak up and] the couple should find a solution for their marital problems; after all, establishing a peaceful relationship is the best of all. Know that narrow mindedness [in marital relationship] is a general characteristic of human beings. If you [can overcome this narrow mindedness and] be graceful in your relationships and always keep the Lord in mind, God will surely notice it as He is aware of everything you do.
You can never treat your wives in an equal manner, even if you do your best. But this does not mean that you can leave a wife of yours in limbo (not having a real marital relationship with her nor divorcing her so that she may find a better relationship.) It will be ideal to establish a peaceful marital relationship in order to please the Lord as God [will take it into consideration and you will find that the Lord] is Merciful and Forgiving. 
However, if the disagreement is too deep, divorce is the last resort. Do not fear the consequences of the divorce as God will provide for you out of his generosity. God’s resources are limitless and He is the Most Wise and the Most Knowledgeable [about what His creatures are going through.] 
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. I (God) am telling you (as I told the others before you, whom I blessed with the Scripture) that you should always keep God with all respect in mind. If you disobey the Lord, [it matters the least as] everything in the universe belongs to God; thus, God is not in need of anyone and is worthy of all praise. 
The One Who owns whatever is in the heavens and the earth is enough to be depended upon. 
You mankind should realize that if God wills, He can destroy all of you (as He made the dinosaurs extinct) and replace you by other creatures. He is Powerful enough to do it. 
If one appreciates receiving a reward for his efforts in this world, he should realize that God rewards not in this world, but also in Hereafter. God hears [everything that you say] and sees [everything that you do and consequently rewards you according to what you say and what you do.] 
You, as a believer, should stand out firmly for justice. Therefore, if you testify, please God by saying the truth; even if it is against yourself, your parents and your dearest ones. It does not matter if the truth hurt the rich person or the poor person involved as seeking God’s pleasure has the priority [and He will take care of those who are hurt by your testimony.] Do not follow your sentiments in the matter of justice and know that God is fully aware of what you do. 
As a believer, you must believe in God, His Prophet, this Qur’an which is revealed to your Prophet and the Scriptures which was revealed to the previous Prophets. The one who denies God, His angles, His Books His Prophets and the Day of Judgment is indeed in absolute darkness.
The one who joins the believers, then turns into the disbelief, then [change his mind and] claims that he is a believer and then turns his back to the faith and walks into the darkness, will neither be forgiven nor receive any guidance from the Lord. 
Let the hypocrites know that a painful punishment is awaiting them. 
What do they look forward to when they prefer the patronage of the disbelievers over the friendship of the believers? Do they want to secure peace and honor for themselves? Do they not realize that God is the source of honor and security? 
God has already ordered you in this Book not to stay in a gathering (such as a comedy show) where the words of God are being disclaimed and ridiculed. You may return back as soon as they change the subject. If You stay in such a meeting, you are equally guilty. Beware that God will gather all hypocrites and disbelievers in the Hell. 
The latter are those who want you to give them credit for their “support”, if you win and ask for credit from your enemies, if they win. God will judge their case in the Day of Judgment. Rest assured that God will never give the [final] victory to the disbelievers over the believers. 
The hypocrites think that they are smart; but they cannot play a trick on God. When they stand in congregational prayers, it its just for the sake of being seen and not to worship God wholeheartedly. They are the ones who rarely keep God in mind and rarely mention Him. 
They are moving back and forth between the belief and the disbelief. They are neither on this side or that side. [They have earned God’s disenchantment and] you cannot guide the one whom God has left to wonder further in darkness. 
If you are a believer, you should not prefer the patronage of the disbelievers over the friendship of the believers. Do you wish to provide God with a tangible proof against yourselves? 
The hypocrites have already earned their place in the lowest level of the Hellfire and you cannot find any one to help them. 
Except those of them who sincerely repent, improve their situation, hold fast to God and stick with their religion. Then God will count them among the believers and the believers are entitled to a great reward. 
What will God earn by punishing you, if you are a thankful believer? No way; God appreciates [the goodness] and knows [the truth.]
God does not like fowl language used in public, except by the one who has been subject to a gross injustice [and cannot control himself.] 
If you do something good (known by public or kept secret) or forgive someone’s evil deed, God will notice it. Know that God is Forgiving and Powerful. 
Those who deny God and His Prophet, try to establish the separation of God and His Prophet and believe in some part of the God’s commandments and disregard the rest and try to be smart by staying in between,... 
they are indeed disbelievers and there is an awful punishment in reserve for the disbelievers. 
As to those who believe in God and His Prophet and do not seek any separation between God and prophet hood, they will soon receive their due reward as God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful. 
The people of the scripture will ask you to perform a miracle and ask God to send down a divine book from the heaven [as a proof to your claim for prophet hood.] Never mind them as these are the same people who asked Moses for even greater miracle. They said: “Show us God in person.” They [naturally could not stand the presence of the Lord and] were caught by thunder and lightening for their audacity. In spite of all that, they turned into cow worshipping! [This proves that no miracle can change their behavior/ attitude.] Even so I forgave them and blessed Moses with the most amazing miracles. 
I raised the Mount Sinai over them and took the most serious covenant from them [to follow the orders of God. But when ] I asked them to enter the city [of Jerusalem and purify it from the disbelievers, they said: “Moses, you and your God go conquer the city and then we will enter in!] I also asked them to take off on Saturdays and rest [but they disobeyed this commandment too.] 
They broke their covenant, killed the Prophets of God [who had done nothing but stand for the justice] and said that: “Our hearts are sealed [and cannot respond to the Lord’s appeals.]” Only a few of them are true believers. 
They turned their back to the faith and accused Mary of having committed a great sin. 
They [proudly] spread a rumor that: “We killed Jesus, son of Mary.” For sure they did neither kill Jesus nor crucify him. Their wishful thinking has created so much confusion in account of the lack of [historical] proof for their saying. Know for sure that they did not kill him.
Indeed not. God raised Jesus unto Him and God is Most Powerful [and can do such a thing] and the Most Wise [in doing so.] 
It is an obligation of all those who believe in the Scripture, to believe in the prophet hood of Jesus before their deaths. Otherwise, Jesus will testify against them on the Day of Judgment. 
Due to the wrongdoings of [those who chose to call themselves] the “Jews” and their persistence in deviation from the straight path, I made some lawful things unlawful for them [and this probably by their own hands, when they dared to change the words of God in the Scriptures and insert what suited them the best.] 
After all, they are the ones who loan money to earn interest (in spite of the fact that this was clearly prohibited for them) and devour people’s wealth. Know that I have prepared an awful punishment for those of them who have turned their back to the faith. 
As to those of them who have devoted themselves to the discovery of the truth, have chosen to believe, believe in what is revealed to you as well as the previous Prophets, worship God on regular basis, engage in charity and believe in God and the Day of Judgment, I will give them a great reward. 
There is no doubt that I have sent my revelations to you the same way that I revealed them to Noah and the prophets after him such as Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Patriarchs, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron and Solomon. As to David, I gave him the Psalms. 
There are the Prophets that I have told you about and there are the Prophets that I have not told you about. As to Moses, God directly talked to him. 
Prophets have been sent to give good news [about the rewards for their good deeds] and warn people [of the consequences of their evil deeds and their responsibilities.] They are sent so that people could not justify their wrongdoings by the reason of ignorance. Indeed God is the Most Wise and the Highest in rank. 
God, hereby, testifies that what you say on His behalf is the true revelation of God, reflecting His Knowledge. The angles also testify for this; but God Himself is enough to be relied upon as witness. 
Those who have chosen to disbelieve and prevent people [in any manner such as recourse to multi- media in our time] to join the believers, have indeed gone far in darkness [to be saved.]
As to those who disbelieve and do injustice, God will not forgive them nor guide them to the straight path. 
The only path that God will guide them to is the path which leads to the Hell (in which they will live in forever) and this is certainly easy for God to do. 
O’ mankind! this Prophet has come from God, armed with truth to you. Believing in him is the best decision of yours. If you decide not to believe, know that [you harm none but yourself as God does not need your belief as] everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. Know that God knows everything [thus you cannot do mischief in His Kingdom without His knowledge and that] He is the Most Wise. 
O’ people of the Scripture, do not exaggerate your religion [and make such over-exaggerated statement such is Jesus in son of God or the God Himself re-incarnated] and attribute nothing but the truth to God. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was no more than a Prophet of God and His Command [as he was born without a father and only by the command of God: “Be” and he was.] His word was the word of God and his spirit was originated from the Divine source. So believe in God and His Prophets and do not believe in “trinity” as rejecting such concept will be your best decision. Know that God [Who is referred to by Christians as “God the Father”] is the One and Only God. It is beneath His Dignity to have a son [which characterizes the low level forms of lives such as animals.] To God belongs everything which is in the heavens and the earth [including His dearest Prophet Jesus.] God alone suffice to rely upon [and you do not have to beg the others such as Jesus, Holy Spirit or no one else] as Protector [and Provider.] 
Jesus by no means will regard it as unworthy of him to be the servant of God; nor do the angles who are near to God. The one who is arrogant and resents worshipping the Lord, [he should know that] God [ pretty soon] will gather them all to His court. 
As to those who believe and do good deeds, God will give them their due rewards and even more out of generosity. To the arrogant ones and those who resent His worship, on the contrary, God will impose a painful punishment and they will find none to help them out and realize that there is only One God. 
O mankind! Here God has sent you His undeniable proof. Indeed I have sent you a radiant beacon. 
Thus those who chose to believe and gather around the beacon of God will soon receive His Grace and Mercy and will be guided to the right path.
When they ask you about the division of the inheritance of a childless person, say: “If the deceased is a man, his sister will get half of the inheritance. If the deceased is a woman, her brother will get all the inheritance. If the deceased man has two sisters, they will inherit two-thirds of the inheritance and if there are more than two brothers and sisters involved, the share of each brother will be twice as much as the share of each sister.” God thus makes His commandments plain so that you do not have any doubt about your duties. God has perfect knowledge over everything [and, therefore, gives you the best instruction.]
O’ you who believe, fulfill your obligations toward God (and obey His laws.) It is lawful for you to eat livestock, except those mentioned herein. It is prohibited to hunt (and eat the hunted animal) while you are performing the pilgrimage to Mecca ceremonies. 
O’ you who believe, have not disrespect for the rituals established by Lord, nor the sacred months, nor the animals to be offered, nor the garlands marking them, nor the people who head for Mecca seeking purification from God. Once you performed the rituals, then you may start hunting. Do not let your hatred toward those who prevented you of pilgrimage to Mecca lead you to engage in hostility with them. Help each other in righteousness and in acting according to divine laws; do not encourage commitment of sins and disobedience of God. Fear you Lord as He is sever in punishment. 
Do not eat pork [as it is already strictly ordered in the Bible], blood, the meat of an animal died of itself (including strangled, struck by an object, fallen from a height, pierced by a sharp object, attacked by a wild animal—unless slaughtered by you before its death-- ) and animals sacrificed for other than God. It is also prohibited to you to eat of the meat which is distributed according to the pagan rituals. Today, the disbelievers have given up the idea of exterminating you; do not, therefore, fear them. Instead fear Me (God), Today, I have completed your religion, perfected my blessing upon you and have decreed Islam (submission to God) as your religion. In case of emergency, it will not be sinful to you to eat of the above mentioned food as long as it is necessary to prevent you from death by famine; God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
People will ask you (Mohammad) about lawful to consume food. Say: “Lawful for you are all good and pure [not offensive to good taste or universally been regarded as repugnant (such as eating dog or cat) by cultured people] things. you may also eat what trained to hunt dogs and falcons catch for you (as long as they are permitted to eat catches.) You must, however, mention the name of God [saying: “In the name of God...” as a gesture of asking for permission and that one is not taking it for granted that he is eating something which belongs to God and not  hunting/killing it just for the sake of pleasure.] Keep God always in mind (and do not kill for the sake of pleasure) and know that God will punish you very fast for your wrongdoings (in this case for killing the creatures of God just for the sake of sport.)
Today, I declare as lawful for you all pure (non-repugnant) and good (tobacco products, for example, are pure but not good for health) things. You may eat the food prepared by the people of the Scriptures (as long as they do not include those items which are strictly prohibited such as pork); for them, too, it is lawful to eat the food which is prepared by you. As to [the people’s question abut] marriage, marry morally pure believing women; you may also marry morally pure women of the people of the Scriptures. When you marry a woman, you must give them their [agreed upon] dowries and establish a real marital relationship and not a secret relationship just for sexual pleasures. Anyone who rejects faith has nullified all his good deeds and will find himself among the losers in Hereafter. 
When a believer wants to worship his Lord, he must clean himself up in the following manner [referred to as wuzu in Arabic]: Wash the face. Wash the hands. Wash the arms up to the elbows. Wipe the head. Wash the feet up to the ankles. If, due to sexual orgasm, you were unclean, you must take a full bath [referred to as ghosl in Arabic.] If you had any digestive excersion (urinated, defecated or passed gas), or had sexual contact with a woman and cannot find water (while stranded as a traveler or to weak in account of illness), then cleanse yourself with pure dust in the following manner [known as tayammum in Arabic]: strike you palm on dust and wipe your hands and face with it. This is because God does not want to make life difficult for you [by insisting upon the usage of water]. God wants to make you [get accustomed to be] clean and, thus, complete His blessing upon you; may you show gratitude. 
Always remember the Lord’s blessing upon you and never forget your covenant with God at the moment that you said: “I heard [the message] and I submit.” Keep the Lord constantly with the utmost respect in mind and know that He is aware of your innermost thoughts. 
O’ you who have chosen to believe, stand out firmly for the cause of God. Be just in giving witness to please God. Never let your hard feelings against a party prevent you from testifying the truth. Be fair as justice is a part of righteousness. Keep God with the utmost respect in mind and know that He is fully aware of what you do.
God, hereby, promises to those who choose to believe, and adopt a righteous life, to forgive their errors and give them a great reward. 
As to those who chose to disbelieve and reject the revelations of God, they will end up in Hell. 
Remember the most recent favor of God upon you as He restrained the hands of those who wanted to harm you (reference to the Jews who invited Mohammad to a dinner and wanted to poison him.) Therefore, keep God with the most utmost respect in mind as the believers always put their trust on God alone. 
God took a solemn covenant from the Israelites and appointed twelve leaders from among them and said: “I am with you; if you worship God on regular basis, devote a part of your income to charity (as a loan to your Lord) and believe in My Prophets and support them, then I will surely wipe out your sins and admit you into gardens under which rivers flow. Beware that, anyone who chooses to disbelieve after this will not find the right path.” 
Then they broke their covenant! Therefore, I put a curse on them and made their hearts insensitive to the truth. With a few exception, they are the ones who falsify the words of the Scriptures and disregard some of their commandments. You will be subject to their betrayal every now and then. Forgive them and disregard them as God loves graceful people. 
As to those who call themselves “Christians”, I took a similar covenant. but they, too, forgot much of their commandments. That is why [as a punishment] I broke them into different sects who will hate each other till the Day of Resurrection when I will bring to their attention what they were doing in this world. 
You people who believe in the Scriptures, My Prophet has come to reveal lots of commandments which has been hidden from you and to inform you of My forgiveness for many wrongdoings of yours. Indeed a beacon and a profound Book has come to you from the Lord. 
This Book will guide those who seek to please the Lord. God will lead them to the path leading to peace by taking them from the darkness, showing them the light and then guide them with His will in the right path.
Those who say that Jesus, son of Mary, is God Himself [incarnated], have indeed forged a great lie. If God decides to destroy Jesus, his mother, and all the inhabitants of the earth, who has the power to prevent Him from doing so? To God belongs the Kingdom of the earth and the heavens and whatever is between. He creates whatever He decides [including Jesus] and has power over His realm of creation. 
Jews and the Christians say: “We are God’s beloved sons [wishfully thinking that God will not punish the].” Reply: “Then how come He punishes you for your sin? You are nothing but ordinary human beings created by God. He forgives whoever He wills and He punishes whoever He wills as to God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and earth and anything between and to Him all shall return. (Confirmation of the theory of the contraction of the universe. 
O’ those who believe in the Scriptures; now you do not have any excuse and cannot say that: “No one ever warned us [about the falsified materials our Scriptures and the nature of the Hell] nor gave us any heart warming news [about the heaven.]” After a long time of having no Prophet (years after Jesus), now My Prophet has come to you as a Warner and as a bearer of good news. Indeed God has power (and control) over everything. 
Recite [the true story of Moses] when Moses said to his people: “O my people, remember how Graceful God has been to you. He chose so many Prophets from people among you, made you kings and gave you what He had never given to the people before you.” 
“Now enter this holy land (Palestine) the way that God has ordered you (fight your way through) and do not [show cowardice and do not] show your back; otherwise you will become losers.” 
They replied: “Moses, there are strong people living there; we never enter to the city unless they leave. If they leave, then we [will listen to God and] will go and live there!”
Two God fearing people among them whom God had showered them with His blessings said: “Just step in through the gate and God will help you to overcome them (you do not even have to fight them.) If you are true believers, you should put your trust in God. 
They replied: “Moses, we will never enter the town [while its inhabitants are there.] Your and “Your God” go and fight with them. We are sitting right here!” 
Moses cried: “Lord, I am only responsible for myself and my brother (Aaron.) Please do not count me among these rotten people.” 
The Lord replied: “Do not be sorry for these corrupt people, they will be punished by staying homeless and wondering in this desert for some forty years. 
Now recite the true story of the two sons of Adam. They made offerings to please God. The offering of one was accepted the offering of the other one was rejected. The latter said: “I will kill you.” The other replied: “[It is not my fault that] God accepts only the offerings of the pious ones.” 
“Even if you make a plan to kill me, I [will defend myself but] will not come a plan of my own to kill you as I fear [the wrath of] my Lord.” 
“I prefer that you bear the consequence of your own sin [of killing me] as well as my sin [any possible harming you in defense] rather than end up in the Hell which is the punishment of unjust people.” 
[Even after this warning,] He followed his vain desire and killed his brother and became a looser. 
Then God ordered a crow to scratch the earth, showing him how to hide his brother’s corps [and bringing his ignorant nature to his attention.] He said: “Shame on me, I do not even know as much as this bird to bury my brother’s corps.” Then he [buried his brother’s corps and] became very sorry [for what he had done.] 
Based upon this incidence, I decreed to the children of Israel (and such passages are missing in the existing bibles except a few verses in Thalmud) that: “Whoever kills a human being (unless the latter being guilty of murder or spreading corruption on earth) should be looked upon as though he has killed the entire humanity and whoever saves a life should be considered as the savior of whole mankind.” However, in spite of many Prophets which came to them with undeniable miracles, the majority of them chose to disregard the Divine laws.
The punishment of those who declare war to God [by not submitting to His laws] and His Prophet and try to spread corruption on earth (where the Lord’s laws are established), is death, crucification, cutting off their alternate hands and feet or deportation (at the discretion of the judge and the severity of their crime.) These punishments are meant to disgrace them in this world; as to Hereafter, they will be subjected to a harsher punishment. 
Except those who repent before you catch up with them. [This break is given to them so that you] Know that God is Forgiving and Compassionate. 
O’ you who believe, always keep God with the utmost respect in mind and try to find the means [such as charity, sacrifice, patience, worship,...] to [please] him and strive in His way so that you succeed. 
As to those who chose the disbelief, they can not escape the punishment of the Day of the Resurrection, even though they owned and offered the entire wealth gathered on earth (and/ or the like of it.) They have to go through a horrible punishment. 
They wish to get out of Hellfire but it will be impossible for them to do so. They have to stay and suffer forever. 
The punishment for the theft (committed by male or female) is cutting their hand off. This is a punishment that they have earned and is decreed upon by the Lord. Know that God is Almighty and the Most Wise [do not challenge it by adopting alternative punishments such as imprisonment.] 
Now if the thief repents [after this punishment] and turns into righteousness, God may accept his repentance (as punishment does not redeem the soul.) God is Forgiving and Compassionate.
Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to the Lord? He may, therefore, punish whoever He wants [and deserved to be punished] and forgive whoever He wants [such as the case in vs. based on His Wisdom] and God has power over everything. 
O’ My Prophet, do not be upset about those people whose mouths say, “We believe,” but there is no belief in their hearts and, consequently, rush toward the disbelief [and engage in kind of activities which does not please the Lord.] Also, do not be upset about [the attitude of] those Jews who have heard nothing but lies about you. The latter have heard [these lies] from those Jews who have never met you and have presented them a falsified version of your speeches [after all, these are the same people who falsified their own Torah.] They say: “If Mohammad says such and such [to suit their lusts] accept it, otherwise reject it!” You can do nothing to save from God’s punishment a man who has failed the Lord’s trial. They do not deserve that God purify their hearts. They will be humiliated in this world and an awful punishment is waiting for them in the Hereafter. 
They [and their judges] are accustomed to appreciate listening to the falsehood and devour the forbidden [such as bribe.] If they bring their cases to you [as the head of the state and them most just man in the Arabian Peninsula], you may judge between them or refuse to do so and they cannot harm you in any manner. If you judge among them, be fair as God loves those who are just. 
Why do they ask you to judge among them while they [call themselves Jews and] have Torah containing the laws of the Lord? They turn away from it [hoping from a judgment on their behalf] for the simple reason that they have no faith. 
I sent them Torah, which is a beacon and a mean of guidance, so that all their Prophets use it for judgment among those who called themselves “Jews.” Likewise, their rabbis and leaders used Torah as the source of reference in their judgments and I asked them all to be the guardians of the Book of God and witnesses to it. Therefore, you Jews should not fear the people and fear me instead and do not falsify My revelations for a small worldly gain. Those who do not judge by the law of the Lord {and replace it by the civil laws, made by their ignorant politicians,} are indeed disbelievers.
I decreed in Torah for the Jews: “Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth and for all wounds equal wounds. However, if the victim forgives his attacker to please God, many of his sins will be forgiven.” Thus those Jews who do not submit to the law of their Lord are indeed unjust people. 
After all their Prophets, I sent Jesus, son of Mary, to the Jews. He confirmed whatever had still remained intact of the Torah in his time. I strengthened him with the Gospel [which is completely lost] which was a beacon, guidance and confirmation of Torah to warn God-fearing people. 
Then I ordered to those who believed in the Gospel to use its laws in their judgments. Those who disobey [and use their own “civilized” laws] are indeed [disbelievers, unjust and] corrupt. 
As to you (Mohammad), I have sent this truthful Book which confirms the intact verses of the previous Scriptures and protects the Book of God. Therefore, use this Truth which has come to you as your source of reference in your judgments and do not follow the people’s vain desires. For each nation, I have prescribed a law and a way of life. If I wanted, I would have made you all a single community. But I want to test you according to what I have prescribed for each of you [and promote a competition among you.] Therefore, try to beat each other in doing good deeds. You will all return to God and then He will inform you about what your differences were all about. 
You (Mohammad) shall rule among them (the citizens of newly established Islamic country) in accordance with the laws sent down to you. Do not follow their wishes; be on your guard that these people do not divert you the least from the Guidance that God has decreed upon you. If they do not submit to the Divine laws, know that God wants to punish them for some of their sins in this manner. Indeed many people are corrupt. 
Is it the laws of the ignorance (pre-Islamic) days that they want to return to? Never mind them as the Lord’s laws are the best for those who have chosen to believe.
O’ Believers, do not take the Jews nor the Christians as your [intimate] friends and allies. They support only one another [like Western allies of Israel.] If you intimately befriend them, you will be counted among them [and deprived of God’s Mercy.] Know that God deprives the unjust people from His guidance. 
You see those [hypocrites] who suffer from the disease [of doubt] are always around them (Jews &amp; Christians.) They say: “In case we (the Muslims) are defeated [then we will have a safe harbor.]” What if God gives you a victory or shower you with His blessings? How can they hide their shame of being hypocrites in that case? 
The believers will then say: “Are these the same people who swore by God that they will be with you (Mohammad)?” Know that all their good deeds are null and they are nothing but the failures. 
O’ Believers, if you turn away from Islam, God will raise new Muslims, whom He will love Him and they, too, will love Him. They will be kind toward each others and tough in dealing with the disbelievers. They will fight in the cause of God and will not mind the others blaming them the least. Such is God’s blessing; He will shower whoever He wants with as God is the Most Generous and the Most Wise. 
Your real friends/ allies are God, His Prophet and the believers (who worship the Lord on regular basis, engage in charity and bow down before God.) 
The one who takes God, His Prophet and the believers as his friends/ allies, should know that the final victory belongs to the party of God. 
O’ you who believe, do not choose your (intimate) friends among those who take your religion lightly and make fun of it as well as the disbelievers and those of the previous Scriptures. Keep the Lord with the utmost respect in mind, if you are true Believers. 
The latter make a fun of it when you invite the Believers to worship with your chant. This is because they are not capable of understanding.
Ask them: “O you who believe in the Scriptures, why you make fun of us while our only “fault” is that we believe in God, what is revealed to us and what was revealed to you? The matter of fact is, most of you are corrupt.” 
Say to them: “Let me tell you who are worse than the sinners, as far as God is concerned. They are the ones that God has already condemned them and have been under His wrath. God turned some of them into apes and swines as they started to worship beside the Lord. These idol worshippers are indeed worse than the sinners and are far away from the Right Path.” 
When they come to you they say: “We have believed.” Indeed God knows what they are hiding in their hearts; the fact of the matter is, they come to you as disbelievers and leave you as disbelievers. 
You can see that most of them are rushing toward the sinful acts and wrongdoings and devour what is unlawful to them (such as interest. That is why Jesus entered to their temple and disrupted their usury business.) 
Why do their rabbis and leaders do not forbid them to say sinful words and devour unlawful things? What a miserable record they are preparing for themselves. 
The Jews say: “God has become stingy (and does not shower us with His blessing anymore!)” They do not realize that their miserable situation is due to the fact that God has cursed them [for what they have done (such as killing God’s Prophets), what they were doing during the advent of Islam and what they are doing in our time in Palestine] as God is the most generous. As a matter of fact, the message with is sent to you has increased the rebellion and disbelief of many of them. Therefore, I have cast animosity among them which will last till the Day of Resurrection. Rest assured that anytime that they ignite the flame of war, God will turn it off. They roam the earth spreading the evil (such as the practice of usury;) God dislikes the evil doers. 
If [instead of this unreasonable rebellion] the people of the Scriptures believe in and respect Me, I will cover their sins and admit them into the gardens of Paradise. 
Had they respected Torah and Gospel and other Books sent to them by the Lord, God would have showered them with His blessings from the above and beneath the earth [see LEVITICUS & DEUTERONOMY 28.] Though some of them are righteous, the majority of them are wrongdoers. 
O’ Prophet (Mohammad) deliver what is revealed to you from your Lord. If you do not do this, you have not accomplished your mission. God will protect you from the people (therefore, do not have any fear in delivering the Lord’s Message.] God will not guide those who choose to disbelieve [therefore, do not be disappointed when you see that the Message is not penetrating them.] 
Say: “O people of the Scriptures, your only way to success is to follow the [original] Torah, the Gospel and the other Books which God has sent to you [which, by the way, are the same teachings that you will find in Qur’an and, therefore, there will not be any question of “changing” your religion but instead following it in the most proper manner.]” However, these revelations (Qur’an) will instead increase the rebellion and the disbelief of many of them [as they do not keep an open mind.] It is not, therefore, worth it for you to feel sorry for the disbelievers [as they have made a conscious choice.] 
As to those who choose to believe and those Jews, Sabeyin/ Mandiyin (who follow Prophet John, the Baptist,) and Christians who: believe in the Lord, believe in the Last Day and do good deeds, have nothing to fear and will not be sorry. 
I took a solemn covenant from the children of Israel and sent many Prophets to them. Unfortunately, whenever a Prophet came to them, forbidding their lustful desires, they turned away from them or (even worse) killed them [e.g. John the Baptist and Zakariah.] 
They were such deaf and blind that they did not even thought about the consequences of their wrongdoings. I forgave them for their wrongdoings but most of them went back to their old routines becoming deaf and blind again. God has been watching over what they have been doing.
Those who say that Messiah, son of Mary, is God [re-incarnated] have indeed committed blasphemy.
Those who [believe in trinity and] say: “God is one of the three”, have indeed committed blasphemy. Indeed there is no deity other than God [Mark 12-32.] If these people do not stop saying such nonsense, they will be subject to an awful punishment. 
There is no reason why they should not return back to God and ask for forgiveness. They will then find God, the Most Forgiving and the Most Compassionate. 
Messiah, son of Mary was no more than a Prophet. Many Prophets like him came and gone. His mother was a righteous woman. they both ate food [as they were humans.] See how I clearly make my point and note how they still resent the truth. 
Say to them: “Do you worship a person other than God [Jesus, Mary or other idols] who can neither harm you or benefit you?” It is only God Who Hears [your pleadings] and Knows everything [you do.] 
Say: “O’ people of the Book, do not falsify the truth in your religion and do not follow the same wrong path that the lustful ones before you paved and took so many believers with them too.” 
As to those children of Israel who chose to disbelieve, they are already cursed by [Prophet] David and [Prophet] Jesus, son of Mary in account of their rebellion and sinful acts. 
They would not forbid each other of wrongdoings; what an evil way of life they had chosen [this indicates that encouraging the righteousness and forbidding the wrongdoings was a part of “original” Judeo-Christianity as it is one of the main pillars of Islam.]
You would see many of them take the side of the disbelievers. It is an evil end to which their soul has guided them as they have angered God and will suffer [in the Hell] forever. 
Had they believed in God and the Prophet (Mohammad) and in what was revealed to him (Qur’an), they would have never allied themselves with the disbelievers [after all, what kind of believer in God allies himself with the disbelievers against the Muslims who believe in God?] The fact of the matter is, many of them have become corrupt. 
You will find that the most hostile enemies of Islam are the Jews and the idol worshippers! As to those who call themselves “Christians”, they are friendlier in account of their lack of [false] pride, the institution of the monastery and the existence of pious scholars among them. 
When the latter hear what is revealed to the Prophet (Mohammad), you will see tear in their eyes as they recognize the words of God (which are the same they are accustomed to recite.) they will then say: “Lord, we believe. Please consider us among those who bear witness [to your greatness.]” 
They are the one who say: “Why should we not believe in God and accept the truth that has come to us, when we are looking forward that God consider us among the righteous ones?” 
Indeed for these expressions of theirs, God has rewarded them with the Gardens underneath the canals flow; they will live there forever as this is the reward of the graceful people. 
As to those who choose to disbelieve and deny My Words, they have earned the Hellfire. 
O’ Believers, do not prohibit the pure things that God has made lawful for you [and do not live like Hindu friars or the Christian monks who have forbidden for themselves lawful food, sex, etc.] and do not go beyond the limits [prescribed by the Lord] as God does not like those who are extravagant [and walk in either direction of disbelief or too much exaggeration in the religion.]
Eat and enjoy the pure and lawful things that God has provided for you and keep God with the utmost respect in mind, if you are the believers. 
God does not hold you responsible for “unintentional” oaths [such as swearing that you will not eat such and such lawful food, not sleep anymore with your wives, etc.] The Lord, however, will hold you responsible for your “intentional” oaths [such as swearing by God that you will do such and such thing for such and such person.] If you break a solemn oath, you have to feed ten poor person with the same food that you eat usually, to give them clothes or (if you cannot afford none of the above) three days of fasting. These hardships are imposed upon you so that you take your oaths seriously. God thus makes His Commandments plain to you so that you may show gratitude [for having laws for every situation and know what your responsibilities are.] 
O’ Believers, intoxicating beverages, gambling, the altars of the idols and their superstitious acts are disgusting things suggested by Satan. Avoid these acts so that you may attain the success. 
As a matter of fact, Satan wants to create animosity among you through drinking and gambling. He wants to prevent you from the remembrance of God and worshipping Him in this manner. Will you not, then, avoid these things? 
Obey God and His Prophet. If you chose the disobedience, know that the only mission of the Prophet has been to plainly deliver My Message to you [the choice is yours then: Heaven or the Hell.] 
The righteous ones who have chosen to believe, will not be held responsible for unlawful foods that they had eaten in the past, provided that they refrain from those unlawful things, be faithful, do good deeds and do not do forbidden things and believe in the Divine law. They should keep the Lord with the utmost respect in mind and adopt the righteous attitude as God loves such graceful people. 
O’ Believers, God is going to put you through a hard trial. In order to make it known to you who respects the “Invisible” Lord’s Commandments, [during the pilgrimage, in which hunting is prohibited] you will see all kind of animals come so close to you that you can easily hunt them. Those who do not respect the Lord’s order [especially] after this plain warning, should expect a painful punishment.
O’ Believers, do not hunt while you set forth to the pilgrimage [of Mecca.] If anyone fails to obey this order, he should send either an offering to Mecca, feeding some poor people or fast; all these will be decided by two just men among you. This is a hardship to remind the guilty one of the evil work [of not obeying the Lord] that he has committed. God has already forgiven your past actions, but if anyone repeats the same, God will punish the sinner as He is the Most Serious when it comes to the punishment. 
Catching sea food is an exception (as people in the ship may not have access to any other food.) You may eat the caught sea food or take it with you for the later consumption. Hunting the animals in land, however, has been prohibited for you as long as you are in the pilgrimage cloth. Do not disobey the Lord that you will all stand in front of in the Day of Resurrection. 
God has appointed Kaaba (the oldest house of worship, built by Abraham in Mecca) as a sacred place of adoring the Lord and a peaceful place for the people. The sacred months and the animals dedicated to the sacrifice, which are marked by the garlands (so that people do not steal or harm them), too should be respected (so that people gather together in peace worshipping the Lord, increasing their brotherhood.) This is decided so that you [yourself think about the Wisdom of the Lord who provides a peaceful international gathering of millions of believers and] realize that the Lord knows anything that happens in the heavens and the earth and that God is the Most Knowledgeable. 
Beware that God is the Most Serious when it comes to the punishment and that [at the same time] He is the Most Understanding and the Most Forgiving. 
As to the Prophet, his only mission is to deliver the Message; [now it is your choice to follow the Message or to deny it and do not forget that] God knows whatever you reveal in public and anything that you keep as a secret.
Let them know that good and bad are not the same. Even if the prevalence of evil (such as pornography, rampant divorce, adultery, etc.) impress you, you (who are given the brain to think) have to respect [the law of] the Lord, so that you may succeed. 
O’ Believers, do not ask [useless & unnecessary] questions about matters, which, if explained in detail, would cause hardship upon you (such as whether or not one should go to the Pilgrimage of Mecca only once or once a year.) If you ask them when Qur’an is being revealed [or perhaps when it is being penetrated in your heart,] the answers will be made known to you. God has forgiven you for what you have done up to this point as He is Forgiving and Understanding. 
Some people before you asked such questions; then they were driven toward the disbelief in account of their very own questions [as they could not face the answers.] 
God has never ordained your superstitious practices such as: splitting the ear of a camel whose fifth new born is a male, to let loose a camel as a fulfillment of a vow, not to use the first born twin camel or respect the he-camel as soon as his “grandson” grows up and fits for riding! These practices are falsely attributed to the Lord and most disbelievers follow it blind folded without thinking about them. 
When it is said to them: “Follow the laws of the Lord which is revealed to the Prophet,” they reply: “We prefer to follow our forefathers way of life [even though it implies nonsense such as the above mentioned practices.]” What if their forefathers knew nothing and their “way of life” would lead them nowhere? 
‘O Believers, you are only responsible for your own soul [even though it is a part of Islam to advise people against wrongdoings.] The others’ wrongdoings will not be reflected in your account. Know that you will all return to the Lord and He will remind you of what you were doing. 
O’ Believers, make a will in preparation of death and take two righteous/ trustworthy Muslims as your witness. In case of emergency (say in a foreign land), you may take two non-Muslims as witnesses to your will. If there is any dispute about the inheritance, detain the witnesses in the mosque after the Prayer and ask them to swear by God saying: “We will not testify to gain something personal and we will say the whole truth even though the heirs may be our relatives; otherwise, we would be sinners.”
If the witnesses are found to be guilty of this same sin, then choose two witnesses among those who were the victims to their false testimony. The latter should say: “By Lord our testimony is the whole truth and, if we lie, we will be among the unjust people in the sight of God.” 
It is expected that in this manner the people will say the whole truth for the fear of their reputation being at stake as it may be challenged by the others’ testimonies. Fear the Lord and listen to Him. Know that the Lord will not guide the corrupt people. 
The Day will come when God will ask His Prophets: “What kind of response did you receive?” They will reply: “We do not know [what was in the heart of the believers]; only You have the full knowledge of all secrets.” 
Then the Lord will [turn to Jesus and] say: “O Jesus, son of Mary, remember how I showered you and your mother with my blessings: I ordered Holy Spirit to help you; then you relayed my message to the people from the time you were in the cradle till your old age. . I gave you the wisdom and taught you the Book, the Torah and the Gospel. I turned a statue of a bird that you made of clay into a real bird. I gave you the power to heal the born-blind and the lepers and brought the dead person back to life. I also protected you against those Jews who mocked at you saying: “These are [not the miracles of the Lord and that they are] nothing but cheap magic.” 
“I inspired your Disciples to believe in Me and you (as My Prophet); then they said: ‘We believe and declare that we are Muslims (in Arabic meaning submitters to the Lord.)” 
One day the Disciples asked: “O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send us some heavenly food?” Jesus replied: “You should respect the Lord [and do not wish silly things.], if you are the believers.”
They said: “We simply want to eat such food to get re-assurance, knowing for sure what you have told us is the truth and be witness to it.” 
Then Jesus, son of Mary, prayed: “O Lord send us from the heaven a table fit for a feast; may the first and the last of us celebrate it as a sign from you. O Lord grant us our daily needs as you are the best Provider.” 
The Lord replied: “I am going to send it down to you; now if someone among you turns to disbelief after this, I will punish him in such a manner that I have never punished anyone before in this world.” 
God will ask [on the Day of Resurrection]: “O’ Jesus, son of Mary, did you ever ask the people to take you and your mother as deities beside the Lord?” Jesus will say: “O Glorious One, how could I [being your Messenger] have said such a thing? Had I ever said such a thing [see Matthew 7-&amp; Luke 18-19], you would have known it as you know the innermost of my thought and I do not know nothing about your thoughts.”
“I only told them what you had ordered me to say: “Worship God, Who is my Lord as well as your Lord [see Luke 4-8 &amp; John 20-17].” I was a witness to their conduct as long as I was living with them. As to how they behaved after my death, you are the One Who knows it.”
“They are your servants. It is up to you to punish them or to forgive them [here Jesus, unlike the Christians’ belief does not make any intercession of their behalf.] You are Almighty and the Most Wise.” 
Then God will say: “This is the Day that the truthfulness of the truthful ones will save them. Theirs is the Gardens under which the rivers flow. They will stay there forever. God is pleased with them and they are grateful to their Lord; this is indeed the greatest success.” 
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in them (therefore, saying give to Caesar whatever belongs to him is nonsense as everything belongs to God) and He has power over everything.
Praises and thanks to the Who created the heavens and the earth and established darkness and light; yet those who disbelieve, [ungratefully] set up equals with their Creator. 
He is the One Who has created you from earthly materials and has predetermined a destiny for you (as well as a destiny for the universe); yet you dare to doubt him! 
He is the only One Who is present in the heavens and the earth and has knowledge over what you do privately and in publicly and what you are earning in account of your actions. 
In spite of his Greatness and omni-presence, the disbelievers turn away from each and every commandment of His. 
Since they have rejected the truth, which is hereby presented to them, pretty soon they have to face the consequence of what they were mucking at. 
Are they not afraid to be doomed like those generation who had to face my punishment. The latter were blessed even more than what these people are blessed with. I sent down rain from the sky and made the rivers to flow under their land; yet I destroyed them in account of their sins and replaced them with other generations. 
Even if I had sent them my revelations penned down in a paper (that they could have touched it [like the ten commandments]), they would have [turned away from it and had] said: "This is nothing but a magic!" 
They say: "Why an angel is not sent down to him [so that we may see it with our own eyes?]" If an angel would have been sent down, the matter would have been solved and then [the worldly test and trial would have lost its meaning and] they would not have had their lives [to strive for their betterment.] 
Besides, if I had sent an angel [as My Prophet], I would have sent clothed like a man [so that they could see it] and then they would be more confused [as to who is this man who claims to be an angel?] 
The Prophet before you were also subject to the mockeries. It is ironical that the same thing that they used to muck at lead to their destruction. 
Say: "Roam the earth and see [with your own eyes] what the destiny of those who chose to disbelieve was.
Ask: "Who owns whatever there is in the heavens and the earth?" Then [when you face their silence] say: "To the Lord; the One Who has decided to be Merciful. He will surely gather you all together on the Day of Judgment. Only those who have lost their souls choose not to believe." 
To God belongs everything which falls in the [arena of the darkness of the] night or [whatever which find itself in the light of] the day. God hears everything and knows everything [that takes place at the darkness of the night and the light of the day.] 
Say: "Why should I take other than the Originator of the heavens and the earth as my Protector? After all, is He not the One Who feeds and [unlike the others whom you take as your masters,] is not in need of being fed?" Say: "I am ordered to be the first [in belief and] in Islam (meaning submission to the Lord in Arabic) and distant myself from those who choose other than God as their Lords. 
Say: "I am afraid of [even thinking about] rebelling and [consequently] subjecting myself to the punishment of the Lord in that awful Day [of Judgment.]" 
"Only in account of the Lord's Mercy, one may found himself spared from the punishment on the Day of Judgment; what a great achievement it will be." 
If God subjects you to a misery [ such as Aids, cancer, death of a dear one, etc., for any reason], none can save you from it. If, on the other hand, God decides to shower you with a blessing [none can deprive you from the pleasure of its enjoyment]; this is in account of the fact [and indicating] that God is the Most Powerful. 
God has absolute control over His servants [creatures] as He is the Most Wise and the Most Knowledgeable. 
Say: "Whose testimony weights the most?" Say: "God witnesses that this Qur'an is revealed to me to warn you and whoever that [eventually] it may reach to. Sincerely, do you testify [from the bottom of your heart] that there are other lords than God?" Say: "I do not join you in bearing witness [that there are other gods beside God.]" Say: "there is only One God and I distant myself from your idol worshipping practices." 
Those who have received the Scriptures (Jews &amp; Christians) recognize this [that Qur'an is the word of God] as clearly as they recognize their own children. Only those [among them] choose to disagree that have lost their souls. 
And who is more unjust than the one who attributes a lie to God or denies His signs (God's words or miracles performed by His permission?) Such person is a failure.
On the Day that I gather everyone together, I will ask the idol worshipers: "Where are those made believe gods of yours that you assigned as My partners?" 
As they cannot come with any excuse, they will reply [as their last lie]: "By Lord we were never idol worshipers!" 
Note how they deny their own selves as they see their [mirage like] "gods" disappear. 
Among them there are the ones who come to you pretending that they are listening; but [in account of their unforgivable sins] I have already made them blind and deaf to the truth. As they cannot understand it, their only "natural" response will be: "These versus are nothing than mythological stories of the past." 
Then they forbid the others from [approaching to the Qur'an] and distant themselves from the belief. They do not realize that by doing so, they are destroying their own soul. 
If only you could see them when they face the Hellfire! They would say: "If we were only sent back, we would never deny the Lord's [miraculous] signs and would join the believers." 
They say so, for the simple reason that their secret [defective nature] is exposed. The fact of the matter is: If they are sent back, they will behave the same way that they were behaving before [as they will forget their encounter with the Fire and what they saw in the realm of the unseen.] They are simply the liars. 
They say: "There is nothing beyond this worldly life and there is no such thing as the Resurrection [after death.]" 
If only you could see them when they face their Lord. I will ask them: "Is this the truth or what?" They will reply: "By Lord it is the truth." Then I will say: "Face the punishment of your denial then." 
The losers are those who deny that they have to meet their Lord until they suddenly find themselves at His presence. Then they become sorry and say: "Shame on us who wasted our worldly lives." They will carry loads of sins on their back; what a miserable load to carry. 
The life of this world is nothing but a pass-time entertainment (full of illusions and vanities.) It is the eternal life in Hereafter which is worth while to [sacrifice for by] those who chose righteousness. Do you not get it? 
I know well how their words hurt you. [Do not take it personally as] it is not your [ integrity] that they question; it is the Lord's commandments that the wicked [take lightly or flatly] reject. 
The Prophets before you were also rejected. They took it with patience until God [at the right time] helped them [to establish their positions.]
If their denial of the truth bothers you too much, rest assured that you can do nothing about changing their mind. Even if you could dig a deep tunnel in the earth or take a tall ladder to the heavens in order to bring an undeniable miracle, they would not believe in. If God wanted, He could have easily guided them all [but He does not want to deprive the man of his freedom of choice.] Therefore, do not join the ignorant people [by asking God to reconsider His global plan and questioning His Wisdom.] 
Only those will [hear and] respond who listen. As to the dead people, [know that] God will resurrect them and eventually they will all return to Him [and have to stand in front of Him for the Judgment.] 
They say: "How come God does not send a sing (a great miracle) to announce his prophet hood?" Say : "God is certainly capable of sending such a sign [and Hi has done so by sending this Qur'an which is the utmost miracle] but the majority of them do not get it [that the miracle does not change the people's mind as they did not in the case of the past prophets.] 
Any animal on the earth, or any bird who flies with its two wings in the sky, is a creature like you and will be resurrected [like you] to meet the Creator. As you see, nothing is left out in the Book. 
Those who choose to disregard My Revelations are like deaf and blind people in the absolute darkness. Whoever God decides [based upon the person's "merit"], will be left in the darkness and whoever He decides, will be guided to the straight path. 
Ask them: "When you are in a big trouble (or when the last hour approaches), whom do you turn into beside the Lord? Answer, if you are truthful." 
The fact is, in such moment of distress, you turn none but the Lord; then, if He pleases, He will save you from your misfortune. Yes; on such occasions, you forget all those whom you have raised to the level of God. 
There were other prophets sent to many other nations [such as Moses to the Egyptians.] I afflicted them with many misfortunes [such as nine disasters that the Egyptians had to go through] so that they may choose to believe and approach God with the utmost humility [by bowing down and prostrating before Him.] 
How come [you may ask] they did not come to their senses when they were going through such disasters? Satan made their style of lives the most pleasing to them [as much as American way of life is the most pleasant to the Americans] up to the point that their inner conscious became insensitive to the truth.
In spite of their [rebellion] and forgetting what was revealed to them, I showered them with many blessings. In response, they got totally involved in [nothing but the] entertainment and vanities. It was then that, all of a sudden, I seized them with the disasters and they were the most miserable. 
That was the way that the roots of the unjust people were cut off. Praise be to God; the Lord of the universe. 
Say: "If God took your sight away, impaired your hearing and made your conscious insensitive to the truth, which one of those (whom you have raised to the level of God) can restore them to you?" See how [plainly and clearly] I explain the truth and how they choose to turn their back to. 
Say: "What if the Lord decides to send you a disaster (with or without any warning), who else but the wicked will suffer [as was the case of the Egyptians of the Moses' time.]? 
As a matter of fact, I sent My prophets for the simple purpose of relaying the good news [about the Paradise where the righteous believers will end up in] and warning [the wicked about the consequence of their deeds here and Hereafter.] Those who choose to believe and reform their behaviors will have no reason for fear and sadness. 
As for those who choose to disregard My Revelations, a punishment is in reserve for their wickedness. 
Say: "I do not claim that I have access to the Lord's treasures, nor that I have knowledge over the world of unseen nor that I am an angel. I simply obey whatever revealed to me." Say: "Is the one who [closes his eyes to the truth and] is blind equal [in sight] to the one who is capable to see? Do you ever [use your brain to] think" 
Warn those who are afraid of being resurrected and stand in front of their Lord [for the judgment] that they will find none but God as their Protector and Intercessor. May they [in account of this warning] adopt a God pleasing way of life. 
Do not dismiss those who [come to you to] worship God early in the morning as well as in the evening. By doing so, they simply seek to please the Lord. You will not be questioned for their deeds, neither they will be responsible for your deeds. If you dismiss them [in order to avoid the disbelievers' mockeries saying "only a bunch of poor & illiterates are around this prophet], you [the prophet of God] will be considered as an unjust [sinner.] 
This is how I (God) test people in their daily confrontations. Thus, the disbelievers [fail in the Lord's test when they mockingly] say: "Are these [less privileged] people the preferred ones by God?" Do they not know that God knows who is the grateful and who the ungrateful?
When the believers come to see you, greet them [with kindness] saying: "Peace be with you (in Arabic: Salamon-Alaikum.)" God [As a matter of fact] has chosen to be merciful. Therefore, if anyone (who has been involved in a wrongdoing out of ignorance) comes to Him in repentance (and chooses righteousness thereafter), will find Him the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
See how clearly I explain My revelations to make the wrongdoers' way of life clear (so that you may have a clear criterion and would not be confused as who is right and who is wrong.) 
Say: "I am forbidden to worship those (beside the Lord) that you are worshipping. Say: "{I will not follow your whims and vain desires. If I do so, I will be deviated from the straight path and will find myself far from those who are being guided [by the Lord.]" 
Say: "I [believe and] rely upon the clear revelations of the same Lord that you have chosen to deny. It is not in my power to accelerate the punishment of your disobedience that you [mockingly] ask me to subject you to [as a miracle and sign of my prophet hood.] It is God who will decide [when to subject you to your punishment] and He is the best decision maker." 
Say: "If it was up to me [to have the final word and] to subject you to the punishment (that you are so impatient to be subjected to), then the final word would have been said. [It is up to the Lord to make the final decision as] God knows the unjust people very well [and will deal with them in the most appropriate time.]" 
The key to the unknown rests with the Lord. Only God has access to such treasure (knowledge.) God has knowledge over everything in the land and in the sea. Not even a leaf may fall without His knowledge. There is not a grain in the darkness (or the depth) of the earth, nor a fresh or dry [fruit or vegetable] which is not recorded in the Lord's profound book. 
God is the One Who puts you to "death" every night [or whenever you go to sleep.] He knows every detail of what you have done during the day [or when you have been awake.] God, then, returns you back to life [when you finish your sleep] and lets you live till the pre-determined moment of your [final] death. Once you die, you will return to your Lord and He will make you review your deeds [in your worldly life.] 
God is in absolute control over His creatures. He puts His angels in charge of your protection and, once your moment of death arrives, the angel of death will take your soul away [from your body.] The Lord's angels never fail in their duties.
When men are brought to the presence of their rightful Lord, the Almighty, they will find Him the most Just and quick in Judgment. 
Say: "Who else but the Lord saves you when you are caught in a disaster at the darkness of the sea or the land and pray (publicly or privately) sincerely promising to be the most grateful, if He takes you to a safe harbor?" 
Yes; it is God who saves you from such disaster and many other distressful situations. Yet, [when you find safety,] you go back to your [old routine of] worshipping beside God! 
Say: "He is capable of sending you a disaster from the above (like a tornado) or from the beneath of your feet (such as an earthquake.) He may also let you divide yourselves into different sects and, in such confusion, let you fight against each other (for stupid reasons.)" Note how I clearly make my point so that you understand them. 
Yet, your people reject it (Islam.) Let them know that you are not their guardian [and that your only mission is to relay the message.] 
Time will eventually reveal everything [and you will realize who is right and who is wrong.] 
When you see that the disbelievers engage in mocking at My revelations (such as comedians who make fun of the religious matters on T.V., etc.), leave their company. You may join them as soon as they engage in another discussion. Now if the Satan makes you to forget this instruction, leave the unjust peoples' gathering as soon as you remember [that you should not stay where God's revelations are being mocked at.] 
The righteous people are surely not responsible for the mockery of the disbelievers. However, if they admonish the disbelievers, the latter may come to their senses. 
Leave alone those who are so seriously involved in their worldly affairs that consider their religion as "another social function" [going to the church on Sunday (or Mosque on Friday) and once the service is over, taking "business is business" attitude.] Let them know that their evil deeds destroy their souls. They will find none but God as their Lord and intercessor [on the Day of Judgment] and even if they can offer a huge ransom, it will not be accepted from them. Such people who have destroyed their souls with their wrongdoings have to drink boiling water and submit themselves to a painful punishment in account of their denial.
Say: "Why should we take others beside God as our lords, knowing that they can neither harm nor benefit us? Do you want us to return back to the days of ignorance after having received the Lord's guidance? Then we will be like those who have followed the Satan and are absolutely confused (as is the case with many people today) while their true friends are inviting them to follow the straight path." Say: "The Lord's guidance is the best guidance and the Creator of the worlds has ordered us to submit ourselves [in Arabic = be a Muslim] to His way of life." 
"He has ordered us to worship Him on regular daily basis, keep Him with the utmost respect in mind and know that we will be returned back to Him." 
God is the One Who has created the heavens and the earth for a reason. Whenever He wishes to create something, He simply says "Be" and here it is created! God's word [as presented in this Book] is the truth. He will be in absolute charge of the Day that the trumpet is blown. He has absolute knowledge over what you see and what you do not perceive. He is the Most Wise and the Most Knowledgeable. 
Recall when Abraham declared to Azar (his father): "How can you worship these idols of yours? You people have gone so far in darkness!" 
I (God) showed Abraham the marvels of the heavens and the earth (what is referred today as out of body experience) and made him sure [of the Lord's absolute power.] 
When Abraham [going through his out of body experience] saw a shining star [while going into the dark part of the earth,] he said: "This must be the Lord!" When the star disappeared, he said: "I do not like a god that disappears!" 
When Abraham saw the moon appearing in splendor, he said: "This must be the Lord!" When the moon disappeared [beyond the light of the sun,] he said: "If God does not guide me, I will be like those who are lost." 
When Abraham saw the sun appearing in splendor, he said: "This is my Lord as it is the greatest!" When the sun set [on the dark side of earth,] he said: "O my people, [now that I have seen what kind of things you take as God,] I denounce your associating "gods" with the Lord." 
"I am sincerely going to turn my face to the One Who has originated the heavens and the earth. I am a firm believer in God and will never associate anyone with the Lord." 
Then Abraham's people started to dispute with him. He replied: "Do you argue with me about the Lord while He is the One Who has blessed me with His guidance in person? I am definitely not afraid of your "gods;" after all, nothing can happen to me without the approval of God. My Lord is knowledgeable over everything. Is it not time that you come to your senses and worship Him?"
"If you are not afraid of God (Who is the Most Powerful and should be feared the most,) why should I fear what you have taken as your "gods" (which have no power to harm nobody)? Who [else but Satan] made you to fall into idol worshipping? Who deserves peace the most? Answer me, if you make any sense." 
"Yes; only those deserve peace who believe in God and worship none but God. Such people are at peace and rightly guided." 
Such was My reasoning relayed to them through Abraham. Thus I raise some [like Abraham] to a higher level. Indeed your Lord is the Most Wise and the Most Knowledgeable [and knows what He is doing.] 
I blessed Abraham with Isaac [his son] and Jacob [his grandson] who were guided the same way that Noah was guided before them. I also guided their off springs: Job, Joseph, David, Solomon, Moses and Aaron. This is the way that I shower the righteous ones with my blessings. 
Zachariah, John, Jesus and Elias are also among the other righteous ones who were blessed. 
Among the others whom I raised in rank to anyone else in the universe are: Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah and Lot. 
There were many other [righteous ones] among the ancestors, descendants and the siblings of the above mentioned [prophets] whom I chose [and deserved] to be guided and put on the straight path. 
This is the favor of God. He chooses to guide, among His worshippers, whoever He decides [and deserve such guidance.] If His worshippers choose to worship others (such as idols, women, children, wealth, any boss or governor, etc.) beside Him, then He will nullify their [good] deeds. 
The above mentioned were the ones who are given the Scripture, prophet hood and wisdom. Now if they (the Jews) choose to disregard this guidance (Qur'an), then I have to entrust this (mission of spreading the will of God) to another nation (as it was entrusted to the Muslims.) 
The above mentioned were guided the same way that you (Mohammad/ Muslims) will be guided. O Mohammad, Say: "I am not going to charge you anything for this [service of] guidance of yours. This is a universal gift of the Lord (to whoever who wants to accept it.)"
Those [Jews] who say that God has not revealed nothing to nobody, do not appreciate the Lord. Reply: "Then who gave the Scripture (which was a beacon an guidance for the mankind) to Moses?" Is it not true that you put a part of the Scripture in writing and hide the rest of it? Were you not taught by this revelation of God what you and your forefathers did not know? Say: "It is God revealed the Scripture" and leave them play their games. 
Here is a blessed book [free of falsified insertions] revealed to confirm [ and be used to separate falsified portions from authentic part of] the previous Scriptures and to warn the inhabitants of the metropolis and its surroundings. Those who believe in Hereafter will believe in it (Qur'an) and worship the Lord on regular daily basis. 
Who is more unjust than the one who fabricates some lies [such as: "Heaven was split and God or Jesus said such and such"] and attributes them to God or falsely says that he has received some revelations from the Lord [thus creating false religions and confusing millions of people and generations to com] or says that he can come up with a book similar to the one of the Lord? Would that you could see these wicked ones when they face the death and when the angels extend their hands saying: "give up your souls; it is time that you get your reward for the false things that you attributed to God and your choice of not submitting yourselves to His Revelations." 
Now you have come back to your Lord alone; the same way that I created you at first place. Now you have left behind all that I showered you with [and you thought that it belonged to you.] I do not see none of those "intercessors" that you idolized, believing that they will help you [on the day of resurrection.] All bonds between you are now cut off and those idols of yours have abandoned you. 
God is the One Who splits the grain as well as the [hard] date seed, letting them grow up into vegetations. The Lord thus creates life out of the death and makes the life to taste the death. Such is the Lord; how dare you to leave His path. 
God is the One Who breaks the dawn and has made the night for you a time of relaxation. He is the One behind the movement of the sun and the moon. Such has He destined out of His knowledge and Greatness. 
God is the One Who let you use the stars in the darkness of the land or the sea so that you may find your destination. See how clearly I make my points known to the knowledgeable people [with whom you can reason and show the greatness of the Lord.]
God is the One Who originated you from a single being. He then put you in your own way and appointed a destiny for you. See how I make my points to those who [take time to] think. 
God is the One Who sends down water from the sky causing all kind of vegetation to grow. That is the way that I create date trees with hanging clusters, gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranate (all from the same origin though different in shape.) Note how their fruits grow up and become ripe. This is the way that the believers understand [and discover the nature through observation.] 
In spite of all these [clear signs,] some idolize the Jinns (extraterrestrials) while it is God Who has created the Jinns at first place. How ignorant of those who say that God has sons or daughters. Praise and Glory to the Lord Who is far above such claims. 
How is it possible for the originator of the heavens and the earth to have children while [you know well that] He has never had any mate? [The matter of the fact is that] God is the One Who has created everything and knows His creation the best. 
Such is your Lord. There is no other God beside Him. Therefore, worship Him alone; the One Who is in charge of everything. 
No eye is capable of seeing Him; yet He sees everything. He is the Most Sensitive and the Most Knowledgeable. 
[Say:] "Undeniable proofs have thus been presented to you. If you choose to see them, good for you. If, on the contrary, you choose to act like the blind, you have simply lost your own soul. I (Mohammad) am not your guardian [and responsible for the consequences of your choice.]" 
See how I (God) present My Revelations again and again (in different manners) to reach those who are blessed with knowledge. Yet, instead [of thinking about them] they say: "You (Mohammad) have copied these (verses) from such and such place! 
Follow what God has revealed to you and disregard the disbelievers. There is no other lord but God. 
If God had willed, they would not [have lost the straight path and would not] have worshipped none but God. I have not appointed you (Mohammad) to be their guardian nor are you responsible for their deeds. 
Do not use bad language when you refer to their gods; unless they disrespect the Lord in their ignorance. After all, I have made every nations' deeds seeming good in their eyes! In the end they will return to their Lord and will be notified of their wrongdoings.
They solemnly swear by the Lord that they will believe, if they are exposed to a miracle. Say: "Miracle takes place at the discretion of God [and that I cannot make any miracle.]" For all you know, even if an undeniable miracle takes place, they will continue their disbelief. 
As a result of their choice of denying these revelations (the most profound miracle), I will keep their minds and sights confused and leave them to wonder about in their rebellion. 
Even if I send the angles to them (as this miracle was presented to the previous nations), even if I make the dead to speak (as this miracle was presented through Jesus), even if I present all unknown things to them, they will not believe unless God wills it (and it is not the will of God to deprive them of their freedom of choice so that they do not have any choice but to believe.) Indeed most of them are [and choose to remain] ignorant. 
Thus, I have appointed for every prophet, men and Jinns (extra-terrestrials) of evil nature to oppose them. They glorify the vain desires to mislead the people. If God had willed, they would not have done it. Therefore, leave them do their "job". 
This is permitted so that the mind of those who do not believe in Hereafter be pleased with such vain desires and earn whatever evil they deserve. 
Say: "Who better than God can judge between us? Do you know any better judge than the Lord Who has sent this Book which explains everything in detail?" The people of the Scripture know well that this Book in all truth is revealed from God. Therefore, do not harbor any doubt about [the Divine source of] this Book. 
The Word of your Lord is nothing but the truth and the justice. None can falsify these Words of God as He hears everything [that the conspirators say] and knows everything [that the enemies plan to falsify Qur'an and, consequently, will deal with them accordingly.] 
If [instead of the Lord's Book,] you follow the opinion of the majority [as it is the case of today's democracies], they will divert you from the path of God. The majority of the people follow nothing but unfounded guess works [as they do not know the truth.] 
Your Lord knows best who is in the right or wrong path [therefore follow what He says.]
Therefore, [follow the Lord's path and] eat only the meat of that animal over which the permission of God has been asked [for its slaughter,] if you are a sincere believer. 
God has already explained in detail what is unlawful for you to eat, except in case of emergency [that one can eat no matter what, just enough to survive.] Therefore, what excuse do you have in order not to eat the meat over which the name of God is mentioned? Indeed the majority of the people follow their vain desires and mislead you by their biased opinions. God surely knows who the wrongdoers are. 
Avoid committing sins [disobeying God] in public or in private. Those who commit sins are surely earning what they deserve (the Hellfire.) 
Do not eat the meat of the animal over which the name of God [as a sign of asking God's permission for its slaughter] is not mentioned at the time of the slaughter; this is indeed sinful. The evil ones dispute the Lord's commandments [asking for the wisdom of the laws like this] with you. If you give in to them, you have joined them in disbelief. 
Is the one who was dead, and then I (God) gave him life (and showered him by the light [of this Qur'an], so that he can walk on the straight path), is equal to the one [disbeliever who is disputing every law of the Lord and] who is wondering in the darkness [by choice] from which he can never escape? Thus [in response to their choice of disbelief,] I make the disbelievers' deeds seeming fair in their eyes [so that they continue their miserable life of confusion going through one trial and error to another one.] 
As a matter of fact, I have given the power to the main wrongdoers of each land so that they may [choose to] implement their wicked plans. What they do not realize is that their scheme will fire back and destroy their very own soul. 
That is the reason behind their denying My Revelations and saying: "We will not believe until the message is conveyed directly to us." God knows whom He should trust His message to and how to relay it to the public. Pretty soon these criminals will be humiliated by the Lord and have to face their awful punishment for their wicked plans. 
God makes whoever He wills [and deserves] to receive His guidance, conscious of Islam (submission to God.) On the contrary, whoever God wills will be so resentful of submission to Him that his soul will fly away to the skies as soon as the subject of belief is brought up. Thus God turns the disbelievers into the "Impure" subjects.
Here you are shown the straight path which leads to your Lord. See how clearly I explain it to the people who are sensitive to the truth. 
God, their Lord and Master, has prepared peaceful environment for them to live in, as a reward for their good deeds. 
The Day that all of them will be summoned up, God will say: "congratulations to you Jinns (extra-terrestrials)! You succeeded in deceiving many human beings." Their human companions will then say: "Shame on us for wasting our [precious] life span [that you granted us] at the company of these Jinns in pursuit of vanities." The Lord will then say: "The Fire is your place to live in forever." Only God may deliver them from the Fire. Indeed your Lord is the Most Wise and the Most Knowledgeable [and consequently will render the justice to the fullest.]
Thus, I will make the wicked ones to have the "displeasure" of having each other's company; they have earned such punishment for their wrongdoings. 
God will then ask: "Did I not send My prophets to you, Jinns and human beings, to recite My Revelations and warn you about this meeting of ours today?" They will [have no choice but to] confess that they fell prey to the vanities of the world, chose the disbelief and, thus, testify against themselves 
This is said so that you know that your Lord does not destroy the nations of the wrongdoers without proper warnings. 
Everyone will receive a grade from the Lord base upon his deeds. God [does not grade the man blindly as He] is fully aware of what people doing. 
Your Lord is wealthy (for the simple reason that everything in the realm of creation belongs to Him) and graciously merciful. He may choose to remove you and replace you by whoever He wills, [if you choose to disappoint Him.] After all, He raised you from the offspring of other people. 
Whatever God has promised will take place and you cannot fight it.
Say: "Do whatever you like and I will do whatever is the best; pretty soon you will see which one of us will succeed. The fact of the matter is that the unjust people will never attain the salvation." 
These disbelievers [as the expression of their gratitude and charity] devote a part of their [agricultural/ cattle increase] to Allah [Arabic name of God] and then [out of ignorance] devote another part to the ones that they have made [in their imaginations] the Lord's partners! [The funny thing is], they do not mind to use the Lord's portion of the charity for themselves but consider the idol's part a sin to touch! What evil games they play. 
Now these idols (that the disbelievers have raised them to the level of God) make the killing of their own children [in account of being female, economic hardship or simple sacrifice to gods at the altars] seem fine to them! In fact these "gods" cause more pain for them and create confusion in their religion [way of life.] If God willed [and had taken their freedom of choice away from them,] they would not have done so. Leave them alone to follow their fabricated religion [so that they wonder around confused and believe that they are following the path of Abraham and Ishmael.] 
They have come up with self-imposed laws [upon charity, for example,] and say that only those people can eat such and such animal that do such and such. they have forbidden some animals to give ride or to carry loads. They do not even ask the Lord's permission to slaughter an animal [after all, it is God Who has given life to these animals and His permission (as the real owner) should be asked for their slaughter.] They have fabricated all these nonsense, attributing them to God. Pretty soon God will deal with them accordingly. 
[As another example of their nonsense,] They say: "Such and such animal's newborn is forbidden for our females [and only the males can eat its flesh!" But when the animal gives birth to a dead newborn, they do not mind to [break their own silly vows and] share its meat with the females of their clan! God will surely punish them for such falsifications. God is indeed the Most Wise, the Most Knowledgeable. 
Those who (in account of their ignorance) kill their own children foolishly, are indeed the losers. They have forbidden for themselves what God has provided for them. They falsely attribute fabrications to the Lord. They are in a wrong path and far from the guidance.
Know that it is the Lord Who has created [your] gardens of upright trees, vineyards and date-palm trees. It is God Who makes the crops (which yield different kinds of edibles) to grow. It is God Who has grown olive and pomegranate trees (whose fruits are of the [same] gender [made of genes and other basic stuff of life, as discussed in biology] but different in taste [and shape.]) Therefore, eat them [that God is creating at first place] freely, give a part of your harvest to the needy ones and do not be wasteful as God does not like those who waste [the basis for recycling and other means of conservations (such as energy conservation) in economics.] 
As to the animals, it is God Who has created them to carry your loads, give you ride and [their skin, leather and fur] be used for your bedding. Therefore, eat from what God has provided for you and do not follow in the footstep of Satan, [who wants to see you forbid what God has made lawful,] as he is your most passionate enemy. 
As to [nonsense that they have fabricated such as] eight males and females cattle that they take first a pair of the sheep family and a pair of the goat family and [come up with the most unbelievable laws,] say: "Has God forbidden for you the males, the females or the unborn sheep and goats? What kind of games are you playing? Tell me, if you are true in your belief." 
As to the laws [that they have come up with] concerning the camel and the cattle, ask them: "Is it two male, two female or the unborn animals that God has prohibited for you? Where you present when {according to you] God was commanding these prohibitory laws?" If not, then who can be more wicked than the one who fabricates lies and ascribes them to God [and turn the generations to come away from the straight path?] Indeed God will not guide such unjust people. 
Say: "As to what is revealed to me, I find that only the followings are forbidden to eat: the flesh of a non-slaughtered dead animal, the blood that has been shed [not trapped in the meat,] pork's meat (which is indeed disgusting [as disgusting as say eating dog or cat]) and the meat of animal which the Lord's permission has not been asked [in the moment of its slaughter.] Even these are permitted to eat in case of emergency [just enough to keep you alive,] as your Lord is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
As to the Jews, I forbade some extra food articles as a punishment for their rebellion. these items were: all animals with claws and the fat of oxen and goats except what is on their backs, their internal organs, or attached to their bones. These are the truth that I reveal to you.
If the Jews continue to disbelieve you, say: "Your Lord's mercy is limitless [and even if you repent now and adopt the right way of obedience He will forgive you.] But [if you persist in your rebellion,] the guilty ones can not escape His punishment. 
Now the idol worshippers will say: "Had God willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshipped other than God nor would we declared unlawful the things which are made lawful by God [The funny thing is, by saying so, they admit that they are wrong and then they blame God for it!]" People before them had rejected the truth by recourse to such absurd excuses until they tasted the Lord's punishment. Say: "Do you have any proof to support your theory? The fact of the matter is, you are following nothing but a bunch of false assumptions that you have fabricated." 
Say: "God has the most decisive argument. If He willed, you would all have been guided. [But His will is to let you have the freedom of choice.] 
Say: "Bring those witnesses of yours who claim that God has prohibited such and such thing." If they [go so far that they] come up with such witnesses [who are willing to falsely testify,] Do not join them; you should never follow the vain desires of those who deny My Revelations [and come up with their own falsified commandments which they attribute to God,] do not believe in Hereafter and raise the others [such as Jesus Christ] to the level of God. 
Say: "Get together and let me recite what God has prohibited for you: <blockquote>&raquo; Do not associate any partner with the Lord.<br />&raquo; Be nice [and generous] to your parents.<br />&raquo; Do not kill your children for the fear of poverty. I will provide for you and them. [If one is going through economic hardship, it is just a trial. Even if one has to die from the hunger, it will be his pre-destined way of leaving this life and happens only once. Why then worry about it constantly?<br />&raquo; Do not approach (secretly or publicly) the indecencies [such as going to a bar, even though you do not intend to drink.]<br />&raquo; Do not kill any living being whom God has forbidden to kill, unless in the course of justice. These are the Lord's commandments, may you be mindful.</blockquote>
Do not approach an orphan's property [say using it as a short-term loan with the best intention of repaying for the simple reason that you may not be able pay it back] except with the best intention [such as investing it on their behalf, put it in a trust account, etc.] until they grow up [then you can ask them whether or not they are willing to give you a loan.] Give full weight and full measure when you trade. See I am not demanding more than what your soul can bear. Never lie; even though telling the truth may hurt your dearest ones. Deliver what you have promised to the Lord. These are the Lord’s commandments, may you be mindful. 
This is your Lord's straight path. Follow this path and do not follow the other paths which will divert you from My path. These are the Lord's commandments. May you be mindful. 
It was in this manner (through the revelation) that I blessed Moses with the Book which was a guidance and full of detailed laws, revealed out of My mercy [to the Jews,] so that they become sure about their eventual meeting their Lord. 
This [Qur'an] is a book which I have blessed you with its revelation; follow it and respect the Lord may you deserve My mercy. 
Now [that you have received this Qur'an] you can no longer [come up with any excuse and] say, "The Lord's Book was sent only to the two nations before us (Jews and Christians) and that we were not aware of its teachings." 
You can no longer say, "If the Book had been sent down to us, we would have behaved more righteous than [God respecting] nations before us." Now that the Lord has blessed you (out of His mercy) with a clear beacon, who can be more unjust than the one who denies My Revelations and turns away from them. I will subject those who show such ingratitude to the severest punishment. 
What else do they expect? That the angels should come down before them or that your Lord Himself appear to them or another [and another and another] miracle? If such day comes, then no disbeliever's belief at that time [like Pharaoh's belief at the moment when he was being drowned] will benefit him. Your only response to these disbelievers should be: "Wait, if you will: We too will wait."
You have nothing to do with those who have divided their religions and created different sects [and dividing the entire humanity into fighting groups.] God [in the Day of Judgment] will take care of them and bring the severity of their crime into their attention. 
The one who come up with a good deed to His Lord will be rewarded ten times more that what the deed is worth and the one who come up with a wrongdoing will be punished only according to the severity of his deed; none shall be treated unjustly. 
Say: "My Lord has guided me on the Straight Path, the ever True Faith, the same Way paved whole heartedly by Abraham: the one who worshipped none but the Lord." 
Declare: "My daily prayers and other acts of worship, my life and my death are all meant to please God; the Lord of the universe." 
"God has no partner. This is what I am commanded to believe and I am the first one who submits to the commandments of the Lord." 
Say: "Why should I look for [and worship] another lord when I know that God is the Lord of [and above] everything? Know that no soul will receive any reward unless it earns it and no one will carry the burden of someone else's wrong doing. Ultimately you all will return to your Lord and He will tell you the reality of what you were differing in." 
God is the One Who has put you (as His representative) in charge of [and responsible for] the earth. He has put you in different positions of authority to try you [and prove to you whether or not you deserve to be delegated authority.] Know that your Lord's justice is swift; yet He is also Forgiving and Merciful.
ALM 
This book (Qur'an) is revealed to you (Mohammad) in order to re-enforce your belief and that there should not be any feeling of heaviness in your heart so that you may warn the disbelievers and to teach the believers. 
Follow this Qur'an and worship the one and only one God and do not submit yourself to any worldly power; how little attention you pay to our admonitions. 
If you only knew how many towns of the disbelievers I destroyed in account of their wrong doings. My punishment came to them at night or in the afternoon while they had a siesta. 
The punishment came so fast upon them that they had only time to say: "How unjust we were." 
On the Day of Judgment, those to whom I sent My prophets will be questioned [as to whether or not they received the message and how they treated it.] My prophets, too, will be questioned [as to whether or not they delivered the message and how they were treated.] 
Then I will inform both [with authority what they were doing] as I was never absent from the scene. 
The scale will justly measure the deeds. The one whose good deeds weight heavily [and outweighs his wrongdoings] will succeed. 
The one who does not have enough to put in the scale, is the one who has betrayed his soul in his worldly life. This is because he treated My Revelations unjustly. 
I put you on the earth, entrusted you with power and showered you with provision. What a shame that only a few are grateful. 
I created you, then shaped you and then said to the angels, "Fall prostrate before Adam." They all obeyed and fell prostrate except Satan who disobeyed. 
Your Lord then asked: "What prevented you from the prostration when I commanded you?" He replied: "I am better than Adam. You created me from fire, while Adam is made of mud [organic compound.] 
Your Lord said: "Go to the lower level as you do not have the right to brag [about your greatness] here. Get out as you are demoted." 
Satan said: "Would you do me a favor and let me stay till the Day of Resurrection?"
The Lord replied: "Your wish is granted." 
Satan said: "As you have degraded me, I will [take my revenge and] appear to mankind enticing them to leave your straight path. 
I will appear to them [in different shape & forms so that they do not recognize me] from all sides: right, left, front and behind. You will then find that most human beings do not appreciate Your favors [and easily leave the straight path in search of vanities.] 
The Lord replied: "Get out of here [the highest level of the paradise and the presence of the Lord.] You are expelled disgracefully. I will fill the Hell with you, and all those who follow you [when the Day of reckoning arrives.]" 
As for you, Adam, you and your wife may live in Paradise. Enjoy all kind of food which is available there; but never even approach such and such tree. By doing so, you will do injustice to your own soul. 
Unfortunately Satan [as he had promised] succeeded in tempting them and they discovered the shameful part of themselves. Satan told them: "The reason for which God does not want you to approach this tree is that He does not want you to be elevated to the level of angels and or have an eternal life." 
Satan swore to them that he is their best advisor. 
Thus he tempted them and laid the ground for their fall. When they (simultaneously) tasted [the fruit, leaf, or flower,... of] that tree, their shameful parts became apparent to each other and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Garden as such feeling is natural and not, according to the nudist, culturally imposed.] At that time their Lord called out to them, saying: "Did I not forbid you to go near this tree? Did I not warn you that Satan is your number one enemy?" 
Both of them [unlike Satan who did not show any regret for his disobedience] said: "Lord, we have done a great injustice to ourselves. If you do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will be the losers."
The Lord [after having forgiven them] said: "Now go down to earth [and accomplish your duty there.] You will be divided into the enemies. Stay there for a while and you will have a [prescribed] provision [to be earned.]" 
The Lord added: "On earth you will live, on earth you will die and from earth you will be raised." 
O’ children of Adam, I have commanded you to wear cloths in order to cover the shameful parts of your body and protect yourselves. The best cloth [to surround you for your protection,] however, is the garment of piety. This commandment is revealed from the Lord so that you may [obey it and in this manner] remember the Lord. 
O’ children of Adam, never let Satan to tempt you; the kind of temptation that led to the expulsion of your forefathers from the Paradise. His temptation led to the loss of their natural garments, revealing their shameful parts to each others. Satan and his followers are present with you but you cannot see them. I have let them to dominate those who have chosen the disbelief. 
When the latter commit an indecency, they say: "We found our forefathers doing the same thing; therefore, what we do is the will of God!" Say to them: "God never commands indecencies." You do not know what you are talking about and [worse than that] you attribute [these nonsense] to the Lord. 
Say to them: "My Lord advocates justice. Stand devoted to Him alone at the time of worship [and do not invoke anyone else's name at that time.] Dedicate your faith sincerely and exclusively to Him. Know that He will recreate you the same way that He created you and you will be summoned to meet Him [and stand for questioning.] 
God has guided some and left some (who deserved) alone to get lost. The latter are those who chose satans as their guardians and yet think that they are paving the right path. 
O’ children of Adam, put your nice cloths on (and dress fully, properly and decently) when you attend a place where God is being worshipped. Enjoy eating and drinking but not in a wasteful manner. God does not like wasteful people. 
Ask them [who believe in nudity and come up with their own dietary plans]: "Who [are these gods of yours who] forbid such beautiful dresses and good and pure things that the Lord has provided for His servants?" Say: "Such provisions are meant to be used by the believers and they [and not the disbelievers] will continue enjoying them exclusively in Hereafter." See how clearly My points are made to the knowledgeable people.
Say to them: "My Lord has prohibited only evil things (done publicly or secretly), sins and rebellion against the truth [as established by the Lord.] He has also forbidden ascribing powerless partners to Him and lying on His behalf." 
Know that each nation [like every individual] has a destiny and none can accelerate or postpone its death. 
O’ children of Adam, I have sent you My prophets to recite My Revelations to you. Those who respect them and reform themselves should have no fear and will not be sorry. 
As for those who disregard My Revelations and rebel against them, they will end up to live in Hellfire forever. 
Tell me; who is more unjust than the one who comes with a false statement [such as God has sent His only son to shed his blood for the salvation of mankind] and pretends that it is from the Lord [and in this way confuses millions of the people of the generations to come] or disregards God's commandments out of pride [reducing himself to the level of Satan who refused God's order to bow down at Adam]? Such people will continue to receive their provisions that I have appointed for them until their times come up and My angels appear to take their soul asking them: "Where are those miserable gods of yours [your king, boss, woman, money, children, etc.] whom you worshipped, to save you now?" They will reply: "They have got lost!" By witnessing thus against themselves, they will confirm their wrongdoings. 
God will then say: "Enter into the Hellfire like those humans and Jinns who entered before you." Each generation which will enter the Hell will curse the previous generations [for having laid the ground for their misfortune.] Once all are entered into the Hell, they will ask God to double the punishment of their ancestral who led them to such a destiny. The Lord will reply: "They will indeed be punished many folded without realizing [that their sever punishment is due to the fact that not only they have wronged themselves but also have laid ground for further evil deeds committed later by their inheritors.] 
The ancestral generations will say to the later generations: "You were not such victims as you pretend either; therefore, taste the punishment that you have earned for your sins. 
Rest assured that the doors of the heaven will not open for those who [like Satan] showed pride and disobeyed My commandments. Their admission into Paradise is as impossible as the passing of the camel through the eye of the needle. This is the way that your Lord punishes the guilty ones.
Hell will be their bed and [fumes of] Hell will be their cover. This is the way that I reward the unjust people. 
As to those who chose to believe and did good deeds, they are worthy of Paradise. After all, I do not ask more than one can take [to be eligible for ending up in Paradise and] to live there forever. 
I will remove any [jealousy or] ill-feeling that they would have developed against each other [in their worldly life.] There will be rivers running under them. They will say: "Many thanks to the Lord Who guided us this way. We know that we could not have found the way on our own. Behold! The prophets of God were right in their teachings." Then a voice will say: "This is the Paradise that your good deeds have led you to." 
Those who live in Paradise will communicate with those who have ended up in Hell. They will ask: "Whatever God promised us came true; how about you? Did you find the promises of the Lord to be true? They will hear [only one word in return]: "Yes." Then a voice will intervene saying: "God's condemnation be upon the unjust people." 
The unjust people were those who drew people from the straight path and made it crooked [through distorting the Lord's revelations and fabricating lies] and denied Hereafter. 
There will be a barrier between the inhabitants of Paradise and those who have to live in Hell. There will also be a group of people waiting in the heights (purgatory) hoping to be admitted into Paradise. They recognize each group by their faces and send their salutations to the inhabitants of the Paradise saying : "Salamon-Alaikum (meaning peace be with you in Arabic.)" 
When the latter' eyes will be turned towards the inhabitants of Hell, they will pray: "Lord, please do not include us among such unjust people." 
Those among them who recognize some [unjust rich and famous] people [of their generation], will call upon them saying: "Your worldly wealth and position (that you were so proud of) did not come to your help." 
They will continue: "Are not these inmates of Paradise the same people whom you [were making fun of and] swore that God would never shower them with any blessing? [Now listen to the voice saying: ] "Enter into Paradise where you will never feel any fear or sadness." 
The inmate of Fire will beg the inhabitants of Paradise: "Give us a little bit of the water and a small portion of what God has provided for you." They will reply: "God has forbidden them to you."
In that Day, I will forget those who treated their religion as a joke and entertainment and were totally absorbed in the worldly affair, the same way that they forgot My Revelations and [the seriousness of] the Day of the meeting of their Creator." 
As a matter of fact, I have blessed these people with a Book (Qur'an) which is based upon the fact, and explains in detail [the way to the salvation.] This guidance is indeed the Lord's mercy upon those who have chosen to believe. 
What are they waiting for? For the fulfillment [of what is promised in this book]? In that Day the only thing that they may say is: "Indeed what the Lord warned us through His prophets is true. Now, is there anyone to plea on our behalf? Is there anyway that we are sent back so that we make it up to the Lord by behaving differently than what we did?" They will, thus, find themselves in a great loss and will realize that what they took as their Lords, have left them alone. 
Know that your Lord is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six days/ period .Then He assumed the authority. I make the night to cover the day and the day to swiftly follow the night. The sun, the moon and the stars follow His Command. He is the Creator and He is in control. Full of blessing is the Lord of the worlds. 
Talk to your Lord in humility and privately; know that God does not like those who trespass His already established limits. 
Do not start corruption in a land which has already gone through the reform; ask what you want from your Lord with humility and hope and know that the Lord's blessing is at the outreach of the graceful people. 
God is the One Who sends the winds as the messengers of the good news of His Mercy. They direct the thick clouds to any dead land that the Lord wants to shower and cause all kind of fruits to grow. See how your Lord brings life out of the death; may you learn a lesson from this observation. 
The land which has a rich soil [like a person who has a graceful soul] will produce rich products (by the will of God) while the poor soil [no matter how much rain it gets] will produce nothing of substance. See how I remind the grateful people again and again [so that they reform and purify themselves.]
I send Noah [like a rain to a poor land explained in vs.to his people. He said: "My people, worship and obey only the Lord as there is no other God. I hate to see you being sentenced to an awful punishment on that somber Day of Judgment." 
The leaders of his people [mockingly] replied: "What a shame that you are out of your mind." 
Noah replied: "My people, I am not out of my mind. I am a prophet of the Creator of the worlds." 
"I relay to you the Messages of my Lord. Believe me, I have the best intention as the Lord has taught me what you do not know. 
"Do you find it strange that a man, from among yourselves, be chosen to warn you so that you may come to your senses, respect the Lord and deserve His Mercy?" 
Eventually I saved him (and those who chose to seek refuge in his arc) and drowned those who chose to ignore My Revelations; indeed the latter were literally blind. 
As to the people of Ad (one of the most ancient nations living in south Arabia), I send their brother Hood who said to them: "My people, worship God as there is none like Him. Is it not time that you [come to your senses and] respect Him?" 
Their leader responded: "You have gone crazy and you are fabricating stories." 
Hood replied: "I am not crazy; on the contrary, I am chosen as a prophet by the Creator of the worlds." 
"My mission is to relay the Lord's Message. Believe me, I am a trustworthy person who has come to admonish you." 
"What is so strange about the Lord's warnings being relayed to you through a person chosen from among yourselves? Do not forget that, after the people of Noah, you are the ones that God gave the superiority to represent Him on earth. Be grateful to what God has showered you with so that you may succeed." 
They replied: "Do you mean that we should worship only God and forget about [our "cultural roots" and about what our] forefathers were used to worship? If you are truthful, then subject us to that punishment [of your Lord] that you are talking about so much." 
He replied: "You have thus condemned yourselves and earned the Lord's disenchantment. How can you engage in an argument about the oneness of God with me? What are these baseless names that you and your forefathers have invented [god of rain, god of the winds, god of this and god of that]? Let us wait and see the result [of your disobedient.]
Then I saved him and his followers out of mercy and destroyed those who chose to disregard My Revelations as they did not have any belief. 
As to the nation of Thamud, I appointed their brother Saaleh. He proclaimed: "My people; obey God as you do not have any Lord beside Him. As a symbol of His obedience, He is asking you to let this female camel [which may have been created in a miraculous manner such as the bird that Jesus made from the clay] to graze freely in the Lord's land [like many endangered species which are protected by the law in our modern time.] If you approach her with a bad intention, you will be subjected to a sever punishment." 
"Never forget that your Lord replaced the people of Ad with you, gave you dignity and helped you to build your castles on the plains and carve out great houses inside the hills. Show your gratefulness by worshipping none but God and do not spread sinful behaviors on [the Lord's] earth." 
Their arrogant leaders asked the believers (who were mainly the oppressed ones): "How do you know that Saaleh is the prophet of God?" They replied: "The nature of the very message that he brought was enough for us to believe in his prophet hood." 
Those who were suffering from [the disease of] pride said: "We disbelieve what you believe in." 
Then they defied the Lord's orders and killed the camel [which was presented to them as a miracle] and mockingly said: "Well Saleh subject us to the punishment that you were talking about, if you are a true prophet." 
Eventually they were killed by a sudden catastrophe, while resting at home. 
The last word of Saaleh before leaving them was: "My people, I conveyed to you the message of the Lord and admonished you, but it seems that you resent those who wish you nothing but good." 
And Lot [also was puzzled with his people's behavior and] told to his people: "How low have you sunk to engage in kind of indecencies that none has committed before you." 
"What is wrong with you that you prefer men as your sexual partners instead of women [that God has created for this purpose.] What a daring people you are [in defying the Lord.] 
Their only response was: "Deport these [God fearing] people out of here as they are too pious [and a threat to our "... way of life."]
I saved Lot and his followers, except his wife who was one of those who stayed behind [as she was "happy" with "... way of life."] 
Then I sent them a rain (perhaps a rain of stones & fires); what an awful rain it was. Imagine, what a terrible destiny for a guilty nation. 
As to the people of Mydian, I appointed their brother Shu'aib as a prophet. He said: "My people, obey God as you do not have any other Lord beside Him. He has indeed provided you with an undeniable miracle. Do not sell less than what you are paid for by using the wrong scales. Do not cheat people out of their rights. Do not spread all kind of sinful act in the [Lord's] land once the corruption has been dealt with. These are the best advices to follow, if you have chosen the belief." 
"Do not practice the highway robbery. Do not entice people to leave the straight path that leads to God and do not justify the wrong doings. Remember you were a small tribe and God turned you into a big nation and [above all] learn a lesson from the miserable destiny of the previous corrupt people." 
"Those of you who have chosen to believe (as well as those of you who have chosen to disbelieve) in the message that I am chosen to convey, have to wait till God judge between us; and God is the best judge." 
The arrogant leaders of his people said: "Be careful Shu,aib! If you and your followers do not return to our way of life, we will kick you all out of this country." Shu'aib said: "Even if we resent your way of life?" 
"We will be guilty of not adopting the Lord's prescribed way of life; especially after Him having [done a favor and] revealed to us the right path. God willing, we will never return to your way of life. Know that the Lord is the Most Knowledgeable [and knows which way of life is the best for His people.] and we put our trust in God. O Lord, please judge between us with truth as your criterion; we trust that you are the best of judges." 
The leaders of his people (who had chosen to reject the message of God) said to the people: "If you accept the Shu'aib's way of life, we will be all ruined.
Consequently (in response to the Shu'aib's plea and their own wrongdoings) they were subjected to a catastrophic shock and they fell prostrate [out of fear or for repentance] and died in their own home [as they were not given any time to escape.] 
Those who rejected Sha'ib, were so wiped out as if they had never existed. Those who rejected Shu'aib [for the fear of being ruined,] were [completely] ruined. 
When Shu'aib decided to leave that [doomed] place, he said: "O my people, I delivered the message of my Lord to you and I warned you [as your well-wisher about the consequences of your rebellion.] How can feel bad about what happened to the people who choose to disbelieve. 
Whenever I sent a prophet to a nation, I tried them in hardship and sufferings so that they humble themselves. 
Then I changed their situation so that they prosper enough [to rebel and in reply to My warnings] say: "Our fathers also went through hardship and prosperity." I subjected all [such rebellious people] to a sudden catastrophe while they were unaware. 
Had such people chosen to believe and be righteous, I would have showered them with My blessings from the heaven and the earth. Unfortunately, they chose to disbelieve and earned their punishment. 
How can today's citizens be sure that they will not be subject to My sudden punishment at night? 
How can they be sure that My punishment will not be sent upon them during the day while they are engaged in their daily activities? 
Are they not afraid of the Lord's plan? The fact of the matter is, only the losers are not afraid of the Lord's punishment. 
Does it ever occur to those who inherit the land [from the previous generations who earned the Lord's punishment] that, if I will, I can punish them too for their sins? I seal their heart [for their carelessness] so that they do not hear [and become insensitive to the truth and earn a higher degree of punishment for the continuation of their sinful acts.] 
I am telling you the life stories of such people [so that you take a heed and come to your senses.] Their prophets came to them [as warmers] with undeniable miracles but they refused to accept the truth that they had already chosen to deny. This is [the Devine law and] the reason for which I seal the hearts of the disbelievers [so that they become insensitive to sins and subject themselves to a higher level of punishment.] 
They proved that most of them do not have the least respect for their promises (like the Jews who God took a solemn covenant from them and they broke it) and, thus, most of them prefer to live in corruption.
After those nations, I sent Moses with clear proofs to Pharaoh and his administrators. They, too, showed injustice by denying them. Note what happened to those corrupt people. 
Moses said: "O Pharaoh, I am a messenger of the Creator of the worlds." 
"In such a capacity, I can not say nothing but the truth. I have come with undeniable miracles to you. Let the children of Israel leave with me." 
Pharaoh replied: "If you are truthful, then show us your miracles." 
Then Moses threw down his staff and suddenly it turned into a huge snake. 
Then Moses took his hand out of his pocket and it started to radiate a white light. 
The chief officers of the Pharaoh said: "This man is indeed the most knowledgeable magician." 
"His main intention is [to change your "Egyptian way of life" and] to kick you out of your land from you [as your land without free slave to produce for you worth nothing.]" Now what do you want to do about it? 
The Pharaoh said: "Leave him and his brother alone.… 
while you summon every great magician [to reveal his tricks and/or cancel his magic." 
All magicians rushed to the Pharaoh's court and said: "Will there be a reward for us [to defeat Moses?". 
Pharaoh said: "In addition to a monetary reward, you will get a close position to me." 
They asked Moses who shall throw down first. Moses said: "Go ahead." 
Then they all cast their devices and created frightening illusions. 
Then I told Moses to throw down his staff. To each magic of them that the snake approached, that act was nullified. 
Thus their tricks were revealed and the truth prevailed. 
Defeated and humbled, those experts in magic [recognized the truth and]... 
fell prostrate (as a sign of respect for the demonstration of the power of God). 
They said: "Now we believe in the Creator of the worlds…. 
The Lord of Moses and Aaron." 
Pharaoh told them: "How dare you to pronounce your belief before I give you the permission? This must be a conspiracy between you (while you were in town) in order to secure the release of his people. You will see."
"I am going to order your hands and legs be cut off on opposite sides and then you will be crucified." 
They said: "So what? One day we will die, anyway, and be returned to our Lord." 
"The reason for which you want to take vengeance is because we have seen the miracles of the Lord and have believed in it. Lord, give us patience and let us die as Muslims (in Arabic meaning in the state of submission to God). 
The chief administrators of Pharaoh turned to him and said: "Now what? Do you let Moses and his people to rebel and mock at your gods?" The Pharaoh replied: "I will kill their males and leave their females to live [and subject them to the humiliation] so that they understand that I have the higher hand. 
Moses said to his people: "Keep faith, be patient and pray for the Lord's help. The land belongs to God and He is the One to decide who should inherit it. Know that the righteous ones are victorious at the end. 
His people complained: "What is this? Before you come to use we were oppressed and now that you have come to us, we are still oppressed!" Moses said: "In the near future God will destroy your enemies and establish you as His representative on earth to see whether or not you will choose to behave accordingly." 
Then I subjected the Pharaoh's people to several years of drought and famine (giving them thus a respite out of mercy) so that they may come to their senses. 
Whenever something good happened to them, they would consider it as their own achievement and whenever a misfortune overtook them, they would blame Moses and his people for it. What they did not realize was that all those misfortunes were sent to them by God [to humble them.] 
They said to Moses: "No matter how many miracles you come up with, we will never believe in you!" 
I sent upon them the storm [causing many deaths], the locusts, the lice, the frogs and the rain of blood. They denied all these signs as they were guilty of arrogance. 
Any time that they were subject to one of these misfortunes, they would come to Moses and say: "Please use your closeness to the Lord and ask Him to remove this calamity from us. If you can remove it, we will definitely believe in you this time and let the Israelites go with you." 
But as soon as I finish with one calamity, at its prescribed time, they would immediately break their promises.
Thus, I took My revenge and drowned them all in the sea. After all, they denied My sings and did not taking My warnings seriously. 
After this I made those who had been oppressed (the Israelites) the inheritors of the east and the west part of the blessed land (Palestine.) Thus your Lord fulfilled His Promise to them as they had shown the patience. As to Pharaoh and his people, I ruined what they had accomplished and their high rises. 
After letting the Israelites pass through the sea, they started their journey and came upon a people who were worshipping their idols. The Israelites [who were fascinated by their rituals] said: "Moses, Make a similar god for us [so that we can sing and dance and engage in a kind of fascinating rituals that these people are involved with.] Moses replied: "What an ignorant people you are." 
"What these people are doing will lead to their destruction and what they are doing is nothing but the vanities." 
Then he added: "Should I look for another god for you while it was God who showered you, more than any other nation in the world, with His blessing?" 
"Have you forgotten that it was God who saved you from the worst persecution of the people of Pharaoh? They were killing your males and abusing your females. What a great trial the Lord let you go through!" 
Then I summoned Moses for an audience of forty days [to Mt. Sinai for the revelation of Torah.] Before his departure, Moses said to his brother Aaron: "In my absence, you are in charge. Maintain righteousness and do not follow the corrupt people's path." 
When Moses came to My meeting and His Lord spoke to him, he requested: "Lord, indulge me with the pleasure of looking at you." His Lord said: "You [are physically limited and] cannot see me. Look at that mountain [which is made of the matter]; if it can stand My [full] presence, then your eyes [which are made of the matter] will be capable to see me too". When His Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, that turned it into fine dust, and Moses fell unconscious. When Moses got back to normal, he said: "Lord, Glory is yours. Please accept my repentance. I am the first to believe in you." 
I said: "Moses, I have chosen you among all the people to have [direct] conversation with Me and to deliver My Message. Take [care of] what I am giving you and be grateful." 
Then I made My admonitions, concerning every aspect of life, and detailed commandments, being inscribed upon the tablets. I gave them to Moses and said: "Take these wholeheartedly and tell your people to follow them according to their best sense [and not to make them subject to the strange kind of interpretations.] Pretty soon, I will show you where the wicked ones will end in."
"As to those who behave arrogantly on the for no reason, I will make them insensitive to My Revelations so that they do not believe in it. If they see a path of guidance, they will resent taking it but if they see a crooked path, they will be attracted to it. This is their punishment for the denial of My Signs and their caring less." 
"Any good deed of those who deny My Revelations (as well as meeting Me on the Last Day), is nullified. Is it not that the guilty ones expect a fair punishment in accordance to what they have done?" 
While Moses was absent [receiving the most important code of behavior for the believers], his people melted down their jewelries to make the statue of a cow with a capacity to make a sound. Were they not able to see that it could not neither talk nor guide them to the right path? Yet they took it as their god; how unjust of them. 
When they [saw Moses and] came to their senses, they realized that they have gone too far. They then prayed: "If our Lord does not show mercy and does not forgive us, we are nothing but the losers." 
That was when Moses returned in rage and disappointment saying: "What you have done in my absence is the most devilish. Could you not wait for me with the patience so that I come back with the Lord's Commandments?" Then he threw down the tablets and took his brother's hair and dragged him in anger. Aaron said: "Son of my mother, these people rebelled and wanted to kill me. Do not make my enemies happy by treating me like the wrongdoers." 
Moses then said: "Lord, please forgive me and my brother and admit us into the dominion of your mercy as you are the Most Merciful." 
The Lord said: "Those who chose the cow as their god, have surely earned their Lord's anger. They will encounter nothing but the misery in their worldly life. This is the way that I punish those who fabricate falsehood." 
"As for those who committed the sins and then came to their senses and repented, and chose to believe, will surely find your Lord the Most Forgiving and Merciful."
When the Moses' anger was calmed down, he picked up the broken tablets which were source of guidance, manifesting the Lord's mercy for God respecting people. 
Moses then chose seventy men from among his people to come to the next audience of Mine [asking for forgiveness and hoping to receive a new copy of the broken tablets.] When a sever earthquake overtook them, Moses said: "My Lord, if it was your will, you would have destroyed them along with me long time ago. Is it now your will to destroy us all in account of the stupidity of some of us? What happened was really a test for us so that you decide to mislead whoever you want [and naturally deserves] and guide whoever you will. You are our only Protector; please forgive us and have mercy on us as you are the Most Forgiving." 
"Lord please grant us the best in this world and in the Hereafter. We have now turned to you." The Lord replied: "As far as the punishment is concerned, it will be sent to whoever I decide. As to My Mercy, it embraces everything [after all, without the Lord's Mercy, the whole universe will be crumbled down as He is the one who keeps its together.]" I will shower My Mercy upon those who obey me, spend on charity and believe in My Revelations." 
[Now that you are given this background,] know that all those who follow this [as mocked at by Jews as] "gentile prophet" {which is prophesized in the old testament [Deuteronomy 15-as well as in the original Gospel [which its fragments can be found here and there such as John 14:16-& 16:13]}who invites them to do good, forbids wrongdoings, makes pure things lawful and impure things unlawful, relieves them of their [falsified legal] burdens and frees them from their shackles [of superstition and fabricated theologies.] Only those will succeed who believe in his prophet hood, support him in his mission, give him a helping hand and follow the light (Qur'an) which is revealed to him. 
Say: "O mankind, I am a Messenger to all of you from the Lord to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no deity beside Him. He is the One Who gives life and ordains death. Therefore, believe in God and His Messenger, the "gentile prophet" who believes in God and His Commandments. Follow him, that you may be guided." 
Among the people of Moses, there were some who admonished the others and used justice in their judgments. 
I divided the people of Moses [a big community of some two million] into twelve clans and told Moses to strike a certain rock with his staff while they were all thirsty. Suddenly twelve springs gushed forth from the stone and each clan intuitively went to its assigned spring. I covered them with the shade of the cloud and sent them manna and quails [from the sky.] I wanted them to eat pure things [and be grateful.] What they ended up doing did not hurt Me the least, they simply did injustice to their own souls."
Recall [their response] when they were told: "march into the town (Palestine), bow down your head as a sign of being humble, say "hittatum" (amnesty to its dwellers), get established in that town and enjoy what God has in reserve for you there. I will forgive your sins [such as worshipping the cow] and reward the good deeds of the righteous ones among you many folded." 
The most unjust people among them, changed what was commanded and fabricated their own version. Consequently, I sent misery from the sky for them for being so unjust. 
Ask them about their disobedience [JEREMIAH 21-&amp; EZEKIEL 12-24], concerning the law that prohibited them to work on Saturdays (punishable by death (Exodus 12-16).) I tried the inhabitants of one of their sea-ports [probably close by Aquaba] by bringing schools of fish close to shore on Saturdays and none during the week days. What a [difficult] trial the wrongdoers had to go thru [to prove that they have reformed themselves.] 
When some of them [who were not violating the Sabbath but were "respecting" the freedom of choice of those who were breaking the law] asked [those who had assumed their God ordained responsibility to invite people to the righteousness and forbid them from wrongdoings]: "Why do you [do not mind your business and] bother to preach the people whom God is going to destroy or severely punish?" The preachers said: "In order to accomplish our God assigned duty and hoping that they may come to their senses [in the last moments] and respect the Lord." 
When they completely forgot the commandments that they were reminded of [by their preachers], I saved those who were forbidding the wrongdoings and severely punished the rebels [including those who did not participate in preaching as it was a part of the commandments] as they were corrupt. 
When, even after this punishment, they persisted in breaking the law, I said to them, "Become apes; disgusted and disgraced!" 
Remind them that God has declared that He will rise up against them different people [the last one being the Nazis during 1940s] who will subject them to the harshest persecution over and over again till the Day of Resurrection. Your Lord is the most efficient in punishment and [at the same time] the Most Forgiving [as He has let them to establish their own state of Israel and start acting unjust] and the Most Merciful [leaving the doors open to them to repent and submit themselves to the will of God ("be a Muslim" in Arabic language.)]
I divided them into separate communities, scattered all over the earth. Some of them were righteous and some wrongdoers. I tried them both in prosperity and in misery so that they might come back [to the straight path.] 
The generations after them inherited the Scripture, but they preferred the vanities of this low life and said: "God will forgive us (as they were considering themselves the favorites of the Lord)!" Now if they would have received another [shameful] proposal, they would not have hesitated in accepting it. Did they not make a solemn covenant that they will uphold the Scripture and say nothing but the truth about the Lord? They have studied the Scriptures and know that the Hereafter is much better for the righteous ones? Do they ever contemplate? 
As for those who make the Scripture the center of their life and worship the Lord on regular basis, I will not let go waste the reward of such righteous people. 
I raised the mountain above them like an umbrella and they thought that they will be crushed by it. Then I said to them: "Hold fast to this Book and remember its commandments so that you may attain righteousness. 
Your Lord once gathered all the descendants of Adam and asked them: "Am I your Lord?" they replied: "Most certainly." This confirmation will be presented against them on the Day of the Resurrection, if they say: "We were unaware of these things." 
Man cannot say then: "Why do you hold us responsible for what our grandfathers started and we simply followed in their footsteps?" 
See how I make Mt Revelations clear so that these people choose to return to the right path. 
Tell to people what happened to a certain person to whom My miracles were revealed but he chose to disregard them, follow the Satan and, consequently, ended up among the losers. 
If I wanted, I could have [deprived him of his freedom of choice and have] elevated him by the means of those revelations. His choice was to stick to the world and follow his own lusts. Such person is like a dog whose tongue is always out as a sign of his continuous lust. His life story is similar to those people who chose to disregard My Revelations. Go on and relate these stories to them, perhaps they come to their senses.
How sad is the story of those who chose to disregard My revelations and, consequently, do injustice to their own souls.
The one who [has earned the privilege and] is guided by the Lord, is rightly guided. As for the one who [has earned the Lord's wrath and] is not guided by God, he will find himself among the losers. 
There are so many Jinns (extra-terrestrials) and humans who behave as though they are created just to end up in Hell! They have conscious, but their conscious is insensitive to the facts; they have eyes, but they do not want to see; they have ears, but they do not want to hear. They are like the animal. Even worse than that: they simply do not care. 
God has many wonderful attributes [such as being Merciful, Forgiving, Greatest, Lord, King, Just, Creator, teacher,...]; call upon Him using these names. Never mind those who make such names subject to their mockeries. They will earn what they deserve for their behavior. 
Among those whom I have created, there are the ones who recourse to the truth as their guidance and become righteous. 
As for those who disregard My Revelations, I will gradually lead them to ruin in such a way that they do not feel it at all. 
Even though I am grant them time [to come to their senses], they are subject to My formidable plan. 
Have they ever given thought to the intention of their friend (Mohammad)? He is not crazy; he is only a plain Warner. 
Have they ever been at awe with the functioning of the heavens and the earth? Have they ever closely observed what God has created? Have they ever considered about their life pretty soon coming to an end? What else can make them to believe then? 
The fact of the matter is, whoever God drives to the disbelief, there is no way for anyone to guide him. God will let such person to continue his rebellion. 
They ask you when the world will end; say: "Only God knows and He will disclose it at the proper time. It will be too heavy of a burden for the universe to stand it and will happen all of a sudden." They approach you presuming that you have knowledge about this subject. Say: "Only God knows it but most people do not realize it [and recourse to all kind of fortune tellers to find it!]"
Tell them: "I have no power to make my life more pleasant nor can I prevent any misfortune which will happen to me. Only God can do these things. If I knew the unseen, I would have taken advantage of it and have prevented the unfortunate events. I am only a Warner [to those who are careless] and have good news [about the Paradise] for those who believe. 
It is God Who has created you all from one person (Adam). Then from him, God created his spouse so that he may find peace in her. When the man covered his spouse, she got a light load that she can not notice. When the load grew heavier, they both prayed: "Lord, if you give us a good child, we will be grateful." 
But when God answered their prayer, [instead of being grateful, as they had promised], they associated other things with the Lord ( and started to worship wealth, women, kings,..., and worse than all these, the idols.) 
How foolish of some people associating with the Lord the partners that, not only can create nothing, but also are themselves being created by God. 
These gods of them not only can not help them but are also incapable of helping themselves. 
If you invite them [change their attitude and] to follow the right path, they will not follow you. It will be all the same for you whether you call them or remain silent. 
Those to whom you offer your prayers, instead of the Lord, are merely creatures of the Lord like yourselves. If you really believe in their power, call them for help and see for yourselves whether or not they can respond. 
Do they have legs on which they walk? [Yes or no?] Do they have hands to use? [Yes or no?] Do they have eyes to see with? [Yes or no?] Do they have ears to hear with? [Yes or no?] Say: "Sit down with your so called "Partners of God", and ask them to destroy me without any notice." 
My Protector is the Lord Who has revealed this book and He protects the righteous people.
As for those lower than God whom you have taken as your protectors, they cannot help you nor can they help themselves. 
When you invite them to the right path, their ears does not process your call. Although it seems that they are looking at you, they do not see nothing. 
Forgive their shortcomings, advocate what is good and avoid useless discussions with the ignorant people. 
If Satan provokes you to become angry, seek refuge in God [to stay cool]: Know that He Hears and He Knows everything. 
The fact of the matter is, anytime that Satan approaches the righteous people, they detect it immediately and see what is right and what is wrong. 
As for their brothers [who fall into the Satan's trap], they are continuously being enticed to adopt the wrong path. 
When you do not come up with a miracle per request, they say: "Why do you not ask the Lord to help you with a miracle?" Say: "My task is to follow what is revealed to me [and I am not in miracle- making business.] This Qur'an [by itself is the greatest miracle as it] contains beacons of insight from your Lord as well as guidance sent as a mercy to those who chose to believe. 
Therefore, when Qur'an is being recited, keep quiet and listen; it may be that you also be included in the Lord's Mercy. 
Talk to your Lord, morning and evening, with a sincerity which come from the within, with humility, with respect and in a low voice and do not be like those who simply do not care. 
Those who are close to your Lord do not consider it below their dignity to worship Him, glorify Him and fall prostrate before Him.
O’ Mohammad, they will come to you to settle their disagreement as to how to divide whatever they have confiscated in the war [of Badr (the first war between the Muslims and the disbelievers).] Say: “Whatever gained in the war belong to God and His Messenger has the final word in distributing them. Therefore, respect the Lord and obey Him, if you are true believers.” 
The true believers are those who are taken by awe when the name of their Lord is mentioned. Their faith increases any time that the verses of Qur’an is recited to them and they put their trust in God
The true believers worship the Lord on regular basis and devote a part of their God given earnings to the charity. 
Such are the true believers. They earn different rank with their Lord. Their sins will be forgiven and they will be entitled to the most generous reward. 
Recall how your Lord ordered you to leave your home for a mission of truth and how some believers resented it. 
They were disputing with you about the necessity of the mission, although they knew the truth. They were behaving as if they were seeing the death in front of them. 
When God promised that you will be triumphant over one of the two parties (the caravan who was carrying the Muslims’ confiscated wealth or the army which was marching to destroy the Muslims.) At that time you were wishing that the weaker party (the caravan carrying the wealth) would fall to you. However, it was the will of God to establish the truth (Islam) with His word and to cut across the root of the disbelievers (who were much stronger than the Muslims’ army.)
God wanted that the truth be triumphant and the falsehood to be defeated, to the dismay of the guilty ones. 
When you were desperately praying for help, your Lord responded: “I am going to send you one thousand angels one after another.” 
God gave you this good news as a relief. The only source of help is God; the Almighty, the Most Wise. 
I showered you with peace and assurance up to the point of drowsiness. I sent you the rain to cleanse you from the satanic thoughts, to fortify your belief and to strengthen your foothold. 
Your Lord inspired the angels by saying: “I am with you; keep the spirit of the believers high. I will cast terror in the hearts of the disbelievers. You have the permission not only to strike the disbelievers’ heads but also every joint of their bodies.” 
This was in account of their challenging God and His prophet. Whoever opposes God and His Prophet should know that God is severing in punishment. 
Taste your worldly punishment and know that, as a disbeliever, you will be subjected to the Hellfire. 
O’ Believers, when your army engages in fight with the disbeliever, never turn your back to them. 
Those who turn their backs (except for tactical reasons), they will earn the Lord’s anger and will end up in the Hell which is an awful place to live in. 
Know that it was not you who killed them! It was the Lord Who killed them. It was not you who threw (the sand) against them! It was the Lord Who did it. God did it in order to make it easier for the believer to pass this excellent test of theirs; God hears everything and Knows everything.
This is the way that God comes to your help. As for the secret plans of the disbelievers [against the believers], God will make them ineffective. 
You (the disbelievers) prayed (at the holy site of Mecca) to God (saying: “may the truthful ones win”); the Lord has answered your prayer! Therefore; the best thing for you is to give up. Now if you return back to fight [the believers], you will face the same punishment and your well equipped army will be of no benefit for you. God sides with the believers. 
O’ You who believe; obey God and His messenger and do not disregard him after having heard his orders. 
Do not behave like those who say [with their tongues]: “We hear you” but in reality they have not listened (letting the words come from one ear and left through the other.) 
The worse kind of [so called humans who have turned themselves into] animals are those who are deaf [when they hear the truth] and blind [preferring not to see the truth] and do not think. 
If there was just a little bit goodness in them, God would have done a favor to them, letting the words penetrate in their conscious. However [the way they are], their absorbing the truth [and joining the army of the believers in the fight against the disbelievers] would have caused more trouble. 
O’ you who believe, respond to God and His messenger when he invites you to a cause which will lead you to [an eternal and the most pleasant] life [either through the manifestation of the bravery or the ultimate achievement which is the martyrdom.] Know that God is closer to you than your own heart and that [one day] you will be summoned to His Audience. 
Raise against that kind of collective sins [which is committed by the society as a whole and not a person (such as the passage of those “civil laws” which contradict the Divine laws,...] which its punishment is not limited to those who commit it [but will afflict the whole society.] Know that God subjects the guilty ones to the most sever kind of punishment.
Remember when you were used to be a few powerless people [in Mecca], fearing that your enemies will destroy you anytime. Then God provided a sanctuary for you (when the people of Medina out of blue invited the prophet and the Muslims to migrate there), gave you victory over your enemies and showered you with pure provisions so that you turn to Him gratefully. 
O’ you who have believed, do not betray God and His messenger, nor knowingly destroy the trust. 
Know that [the love of] your children and your wealth are in fact a matter of trial for you (to see whether or not you can sacrifice your worldly possessing for the truth.) The fact of the matter is, what is in reserve for you with the Lord, is much more precious than what you may ever own in this life. 
O’ you who have chosen to believe, If you respect the Lord, He will provide you with a divine criteria for your behavior, cover your wrongdoings and forgive you. God’s Grace is countless. 
Remember [Mohammad] when the disbelievers were plotting to imprison you, exile you or kill you. They had their own plan and God had His own; and God is the One Who comes with the best plan. 
When you were reciting My Revelations to them, they responded: “We have heard these [nonsense] before. We can fabricate such things too; after all, they are nothing but the ancient myths.” 
They were challenging you to ask God to send them fiery stones from the sky or any other sever punishment. [How foolish of them to ask for a miracle that will kill them instantly, not giving them time to contemplate about it and then either accept it or reject it!} 
At that time, God did not send them such a punishment as you were among them. Besides, God will not destroy a whole community as long as [there are people in it for whom there is a possibility that may come to their senses and] they may ask for forgiveness. 
But [let them beware that] now, there is no reason why God should not send them a punishment; they are preventing the believer from having free access to “Masjid-Al-Haram” (built by Abraham and Ishmael for the sole purpose of worshipping the Lord alone] whereas they are not it lawful guardians. Most people do not realize that only God fearing people are entitled to the guardianship of such a holy place.
As to what they consider it worshipping, it is nothing more than [making senseless noises by] whistling and clapping of hands (like some churches of our time who have forgotten how Jesus uses to pray [see Matthew and consider singing and dancing and clapping of hands as the acts of worship!] Therefore, taste your punishment as a result of what you deny. 
Those who have chosen to disbelieve, spend lots of their wealth to block the path which leads to the Lord and [when they see that it does not work,] they go on spending more. What they will earn for this is only the regret; then they will be overpowered and led to the Hell. 
Thus God separate the filthy ones from the good ones. Once the filthy ones are piled up together, they will be cast into the Hell; talking about the losers. 
Let the disbelievers know that, if they stop it, all their past will be forgiven. If they continue [their old tricks,] they will be subjected to what the guilty nations before them were subjected to. 
Fight with the disbelievers till they give up the persecution and a God pleasing “way of life” is established. God sees what they do [and, therefore, knows whether or not they are sincere in their “cease fire.”] 
Now, if they do not give up, know that the Lord is your Protector; the best Protector and the best Helper. 
The fifth of whatever is taken from the enemy in the war, belongs to God and His messenger to be distributed among the relatives, the orphans, the needy ones and the traveler in distress. You will obey this decision [which is the answer to the beginning question of this chapter,] If you believe in God and what I sent to My servant (Mohammad) on the Day of Decision (the Devine help which led to your victory); the day that the two armies (in the battle of Badr) clashed. Never forget that God has power over everything.
Remember the battlefield in which you were in the higher grounds of the valley and they were in the lower side of the valley (destined to suffer from the rain that was sent before the battle) and the caravan was below you. Even if you had agreed to meet each other, you would have not come to the battlefield (as you were low in number and ill-equipped] but God had decided to accomplish His plan and let whoever had to perish to perish and whoever deserved to live to live; thus sending a clear message. Indeed, God hears and knows everything. 
Remember when the Lord made them appear to you (in your dream) as a small band.. Had I shown them as they were (a great army), you would surely have lost courage and began to dispute the wisdom of the engagement. The Lord, however, saved the situation as He knows even the innermost thought of yours. 
When you engaged in the fight, God made them appear to you fewer in number [to encourage you to fight] and made you appear fewer in number in their eyes too, so that [they would be encouraged to engage in the fight and that] God materializes His will; ultimately, it is God Who decides what should take place. 
O’ you who believe, when you face an enemy, show courage and mention the Lord’s name frequently; may you come out victoriously [if it is the will of God.] 
And obey God and His messenger without any dispute; otherwise, you will loose your enthusiasm. Be patient [and do not expect an easy and immediate victory]; God sides with he patient people. 
Do not be like those [disbelievers of Mecca] who marched arrogantly [with the music, dancing, etc.] displaying their force to the spectators. These are the people who prevent people from following the Lord’s path. God is fully aware [and in control of] what they are doing. 
Satan made their opposition fair seeming in their eyes and said: “Today no body can defeat you as I am with you!” As soon as you and your enemies [in the battle of Badr] engaged in the fight [and Satan saw the angels coming to help], he ran away and said: “I do not have anything to do with you. I see what you cannot see. I fear God as I know how sever His punishment can be.”
Simultaneously, the hypocrites and those who are sick of mind [and are not endowed with the belief and courage] said: “The religion has made these people crazy” whereas the fact of the matter is: the one who depends upon the lord, has chosen the Most High and the Most Wise [as his partner.] 
If you could only see how the angels would treat the disbelievers who had been killed in the battle [of Badr] They would slap their faces and kick their rear end saying: “Now is the time that you face the Fire that [you used to deny.] 
“This [misfortune] is what you, yourselves, have earned as God is not unjust towards His servants.” 
The same [misfortune] happened to Pharaoh and his people as well as the previous [unjust] people as they chose to disregard the Lord’s revelations. God punished them for their sins as He is the Most Powerful and sever in punishment. 
This took place in accordance the Lord’s tradition: God does not take His favors back from people, unless they [change their way of life and] prove that they do not deserve such favors. God sees everything and knows everything. 
Thus, I destroyed Pharaoh and his people, as well as the guilty people before them, in account of their sins. I drowned Pharaoh and his administrators for being wicked. 
Those who chose to deny the Lord and not to believe in Him are the worse kind of animals in the sight of God. 
You have signed agreement with such disbelievers and they have violated the agreements time after time; this is because they do not fear the Lord. 
Consequently, if you meet them in combat, make of them such an example that those who dare to come after them think twice. 
When you are betrayed by a given people, annul their treaties. God does not like those who recourse to betrayal.
Let not those who disbelieve think that they can get away with it. There is no way that they can frustrate the Lord. 
You must organize a well-equipped army [to defend yourself and] to frighten your enemies as well as the enemies of God (whom you know) and the other enemies (whom you do not know) but God knows them well. Know that anything that you spend in the cause of God is not lost and you will be paid back in full. 
If your enemies resort to peace, you should incline to peace too. Put your trust in God as He hears everything and knows everything. 
If they intend to deceive you, do not worry as God alone is enough for you as a Protector. Do not forget that it was God Who came to your help at first place and strengthened you with the believers. 
It was God Who made the believers feel like being brothers. Even if you have spent all the wealth of the world, you could not have united them (only two years ago the clan of Aas and Khadhraj were killing each other out of animosity.) God is the Greatest, God is the Most Wise. 
O’ My messenger, God is more than enough a Protector for you and the believers who follow you. 
O Prophet, lift the spirit of the believers to fight. Let them know that twenty of them can overcome two hundred enemies with perseverance. The same is true for one hundred with such an attitude who can easily defeat one thousand of disbelievers as the latter do not understand [why they are fighting and consequently suffer from lack of morale.] 
Now [that new converts have joined you,] God’s will double your power. Therefore, one hundred of you can defeat two hundred disbelievers and one thousand of you can overcome two thousand of them. God sides with those [of you] who show perseverance. 
It is beneath the dignity of a prophet to hold people captive, after the war is over [and after their ransom is being paid.] For you the possessions of this world is important (and that is why you want to keep the captives, humiliate them and even kill them) while it is Hereafter that God recommends to you and, of course [He knows what is the best for you as], God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most High.
If God had not pre-determined a decree, you would have been subject to a sever punishment for what you have taken [as ransom for the prisoners of the war.] 
Therefore, enjoy what you have gained in the war and respect the Lord as God is Forgiving and Merciful. 
O’ prophet, tell the prisoners of the war: “If God finds any good in your conscious, He will give you something which is much better than what you have lost [in the war] and He will forgive you as He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. 
Now if they betray you, they have declared animosity to the Lord. That is why God has given you victory over them [so that they may come to their senses.] God knows everything and is the Most Wise. 
Those who chose to believe and emigrated [from Mecca to Medina, leaving everything behind and thus] gave up their possessions and [put in danger their] lives in the cause of God, and those [citizens of Medina] who gave refuge to the latter and helped them, are indeed one of a kind. As for those who have chosen to believe, yet not emigrated, [although they are your brothers,] they are not the citizens [of the Islamic State] until they emigrate [to Medina.] If they ask you for a help in their religious affairs, be of assistance to them. You may refrain from helping those Muslims who are living with the disbelievers with whom you have a treaty of non-intervention in their affairs. Know that God sees what you are doing. 
The disbelievers assist each other. If you do not unite, the world will be turned into a great decayed land and the mischief will be spread all over. 
Those who chose to believe and emigrated and offered their best in the cause of God, as well as those who welcomed and helped them, they are true believers. Theirs is forgiveness and a great reward. 
As for those who chose to believe and joined you later and strove with you, are your people. However, [do not forget that] in the Book of God, those who are related to each other with blood, have a higher degree of relationship [than those who are brothers in religion] as God knows everything [to the fullest detail.]
This is to declare that God and His Messenger are not respecting their treaty with the disbelievers [as the latter broke it at first place] any more.
The disbelievers are hereby given four months to go anywhere they want but is there anywhere that they escape God’s punishment and humiliation?
God and Hiss Messenger hereby, on the occasion of the General Pilgrimage, disown the disbelievers and give them their last chance to follow the right path. If they repent, they are saved; otherwise, where can they hide from God and His promised punishment?
The exception is those disbelievers with whom you (Mohammad) have a treaty with and they have honored their treaty and have not helped your enemies against you. Respect your treaty with them till the end of their terms; indeed God loves righteous ones [who respect their word].
Once the sacred months are over, fight with disbelievers to the end and capture them. If they submit and start saying their daily prayers and engage in charitable actions, then they are forgiven; indeed God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
If a pagan asks for an asylum, grant him so that he may have the opportunity to hear the word of God. Then send him back to his safe home [to contemplate]; this courtesy is in account of the fact that the word of God has not reached them yet.
How can God and His Messenger abide by the treaty that the idol worshipers have already broken? If they respect the treaty that you have signed with them in Masjid- Al Haram [the oldest house of worship built by Abraham and Ishmael in Mecca], you should respect it too for the simple reason that God loves the righteous people [who respect their words].
As far as the other idol worshipers are concerned, they never observed any right of kinship between you and them and, if they had the upper hand, they would have never offered any treaty to you. Therefore, how can they ask for a treaty [now that they are weak]? No way; they try to seem pleasant by using the right words but they have the worse intention as most of them are corrupt.
They bartered the Lord’s revelations for the worldly pleasures and prevented the others to follow the Lord’s path. what they did was evil.
They never respect any right of kinship nor do they take their promises seriously. They are indeed transgressors.
Yet if they repent even now, worship the Lord on regular basis and devote a part of their [God given] income to the charity, then they will be considered as your brothers in faith. See how clearly I make My revelations so that those who use their brain can easily get it.
Now if these idol worshipers break their promises and make fun of your faith, then you have My permission to fight with these leaders of the disbelief as there will be no treaty left to be respected. May the use of force can bring them to their senses.
Will you not fight such people who have broken their promises so many times, who left no choice for the prophet but to live his hometown and were the first in assaulting you? Are you afraid of them? If you are true believers, you should fear Me not them.
Therefore, fight them; God has decided to punish them with your hands. God will disgrace them, make you victorious and bless the believers with peace.
If the disbelievers repent, God may pacify the believers [so that the disbelievers embrace Islam and become the believers’ brothers in faith]; God knows everything and the Most Wise.
Do you expect to be left alone [and not be subjected to any test and trial]? you have to prove to your Lord that you will do your best for His cause and that you will befriend only God, His prophet and the believers. Know that God knows what you are doing.
It is not proper that the disbelievers assume the guardianship of the houses [ such as Masjid-Al-Haram which was built by Abraham and Ishmael] devoted to the sole purpose of worshiping the Lord. After all, they bear witness that they do not believe! [Therefore, how can they become the guardians of houses built for worshiping what they do not believe in?] Indeed all their deeds are nullified and they have to live by the Fire forever.
Only those are worthy of visiting/ maintaining the mosques (in Arabic meaning the place of worship) of God who believe in the existence of [the One and only One] God and the Last Day, worship the Lord on regular basis, devote a part of their income to the charity and do not fear none but God. Only such people are expected to be guided [and adopt the right path.] 
Do the disbeliever really think that by offering water (to those who come to the pilgrimage of Mecca) and taking care of Masjid- Al-Haram, they are equal to those who have chosen to believe in God and the Last Day and do the ultimate sacrifice in the cause of God? These two groups are surely not equal in the sight of God and God will not guide the people who are unjust.
Those who chose to believe, emigrated [under persecution] and offered their belongings and their lives to the cause of God, have earned a great rank with the Lord and have attained true success.
Their Lord hereby informs them that He is satisfied with them and that they are under the umbrella of His mercy. Theirs will end up in the Gardens of Paradise and enjoy their privileges.
They will stay in the Paradise for ever. Yes; with God there is a great reward.
O’ believers, do not ally with your fathers or brothers, if they have chosen to disbelieve. Whoever allies himself with the disbelievers, has done a great injustice [to his soul.]
Proclaim: “If your fathers, sons, brothers, spouses, dear ones, the wealth that you have accumulated, the business that you have built up and the houses that you love so much are more important than God, His prophet and sacrifice in the cause of God, then go on and continue your lives till God passes His judgment [on the Day of Judgment] upon you [as you are for a big surprise.] Indeed God does not guide such corrupt people [who are so in love with this world that cannot let it go.]”
God has helped you so many times in the past. In the battle of “Hunain” (which took place eight years after the immigration of prophet to Medina and for the first time the Muslims’ army outnumbered the disbelievers’ army), however, you became too proud of your numbers [that you did not remember the Lord, the way He should be remembered, i.e., in humility.] Then you felt the spacious earth around you becoming smaller and smaller and you turned around and fled.
Then [after having taught you a lesson about the pride], the Lord gave peace to His prophet and the believers and sent invisible fighters to defeat the disbelievers and to punish them for their disbelief.
Now God guides whoever He wills to the repentance (referring to a great number of the defeated disbelievers who embraced Islam) as God is Forgiving and Merciful.
O’ you who have chosen to believe, know that the disbelievers have a dirty nature. Therefore, from now on, do not let them to come close to Masjid-Al-Haram [the house that Abraham and Ishmael built for the purpose of worshiping the One and only One God.] If you are afraid of loosing your income [spent by disbelieving pilgrims], God promises to compensate you with His generosity, in accordance with His will. God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
Fight back against those people of the Book who do not believe in God and the Last Day, nor do they avoid what God and His prophet have declared as unlawful, nor do they adopt the Right way (as prescribed by Islam.) If they want to live in Islamic state, they should give up their hostile attitude and pay a special tax (know as Jizyah in Arabic) in return for protection and other privileges that they get (such as not being obliged to join the “national Islamic army.”)
The Jews say: “Ezra (who re-wrote the lost old testament after they were released from their captivity in Babylon around B.C.) is the son of God!” The Christians say: “Messiah is the son of God!” These are just bunch of senseless words that comes out of their tongues. They simply follow in the footsteps of the former disbelievers. God condemns them. They have been diverted from the straight path.
they have taken their religious scholars and leaders (such as Pope) as their Lord. It was Messiah, son of Mary, who enjoined them not to worship none but the One and only One God (Mark 32.) Glory to the Lord; He is high above having a partner (or son or....)
The disbelievers wish to extinguish the Lord’s light [of guidance] with puffs from their mouths but God insists upon perfecting His light, no matter how much it hurts the disbelievers.
God is the One Who has sent His messenger with the guidance, leading to the best way of life, and will prevail it over alternative “ways of life” [suggested by Satan and practiced by man], in spite of the disbelievers’ resentment.
O’ believers, know that most religious scholars and preachers are guilty of: a) devouring people’s money [which is trusted with them to be spent on charity] and b) preventing people to join the way of God. As to those who hoard their money and do not spend it in the way of God, let them know that a sever punishment is waiting for them.
The Day will come when their [hoarded] gold and silver will be melted in the Hellfire. It will be used then to burn their front, back, neck and all other part of their bodies saying: “This is the treasure that you prepared for today. Taste what you have accumulated.”
The Lord’s official calendar (since the creation of the heavens and the earth) has been twelve months [lunar year.] Four out of these twelve months are declared as sacred [during which certain acts of violence are forbidden.] Do not be unjust to your souls by violating these laws. However, if the disbelievers start fighting with you during these sacred month, fight with them and present a united front against them in the same manner that they put a united front against you; be sure that God is with those who respect Him.
Changing/ alternating/ replacing the months of the year [i.e., forgery in the calendar] is a sign of disbelief. The disbelievers make a month sacred in one year and then change it in another year! Thus making Lord declared unlawful as lawful. These kinds of evil deeds seems fine with them. The Lord, however, does not guide such people who deny the truth.
O’ believers, what happened to you that, when [in preparation for the campaign of Tabuk] you were asked to march forth for the cause of God, you became heavily attached to the earth? Does it mean that you prefer this earthly life to the life of the Hereafter? If this is the case, rest assured that all the pleasures of the world is nothing compared to that of Hereafter.
If you do not change your attitude, God will subject you to a sever punishment and will replace you with other [dedicated] people. He is capable of doing everything and your behavior [ lack of enthusiasm] cannot harm Him a bit.
It is not important at all, if you do not help your prophet. God [suffices him as He] helped him before when the disbelievers made him to emigrate [from Mecca to Medina.] The prophet then told to his companion [while they were hiding from their persecutors, taking refuge] in the cave: “Do not be afraid. God is with us.” Then God gave him peace of mind and sent an invisible army and made the words of the disbelievers worthless. God’s word is the supreme word as He is Almighty and the Most Wise.
March forth no matter how ill-prepared [physically or psychologically] you are and sacrifice your wealth and lives for the cause of God; if you knew how good of decision this is.
O’ Mohammad, if it was an easy campaign, they would have been quite ready to follow you. However, they could not handle the situation (marching a long way in the desert in the hot summer, not having enough time to harvest their new crop and going to face the strong Roman empire’s army.) They would dare to swear by God and say: “If we could, we would certainly join you.” By saying such lies, they are destroying their own souls. God knows that they are liars.
May God forgive you (Mohammad); why did you give them (the hypocrites who came with all kind of excuses in order not to march forward) permission to stay behind? How will then the truthful and hypocrite can be distinguished from each other now?
Those who believe in God and the Last Day, will never ask you to exempt them from sacrificing their belongings and their lives to please the Lord; God knows well those who respect Him.
The only people who make such requests are those who do not really believe in God and the Last Day and their hearts are filled with doubts. Their doubts have caused them to be confused.
Had they really have any enthusiasm, they would have prepared themselves to go to the war. It was God Who resented their participation (for their lack of sincerity) and they were told to stay behind with those [children and women] who stay behind.
If they had marched with you, they would not have created nothing but trouble for you. They would have created created confusions and disputes. There would have been some, among you, who would have listened to them. God knows very well those who are unjust to their souls.
Even before this, these people had created lots of troubles and had to recourse to all kind of plots against you till the truth became evident and made them upset.
One of them came to you saying: “Let me stay behind and do not subject me to the temptation (of seeing beautiful Roman women and then committing a sin!)” Such a person is already tempted and encircled by the Hellfire.
If something good happens to you, they become sorry [why they did not follow you to have a share in it.] On the contrary, if something bad happens to you, they will become happy, turn away and say: “We told you so.”
Tell them: “Nothing will happen to us, unless God has destined for us [to go through that “good” or “bad” trial.] God is our Lord and the believers should put their trust in Him alone.”
Tell them: “Which one of the two best things are you expecting to happen to us [victory in the war or martyrdom?] As for us, we expect that God would severely punish you, either by our hands our any other mean that He wills. Wait, we are waiting too.”
Tell them: “Whether you (willingly or unwillingly) spend money in the cause of God, it does not matter: God will not accept the offerings of corrupt people like you.”
The reason for which their offerings will not be accepted is because of their attitudes: They have not truly believed in God and His prophet, they participate in daily prayers reluctantly and they participated in charities out of hypocrisy.
Do not let their wealth or children delude you. God wants to punish them by means of these very things in their worldly life [as their wealth and children will create more headache for them than happiness.] their wealth and children will cause them to die in the state of disbelief [and, therefore, be sentenced to Hellfire.]
They swear by God that they are your followers. However, they are not your people. They are people who [resent you and] would do their best to divide your followers.
If they could find a place (even a cave) to flea [like most hypocrites of our time who emigrate to the West], they would run as fast as possible to take refuge in it [and to save themselves from their Islamic obligations such as praying, fasting,............ ]
Some of them do not like the way that you distribute the charity funds. If you give them some, they become glad. But if you exclude them, they will become angry.
How nice of them would have been, if they had counted their blessings. They could have said: “We only rely upon God and we are grateful for what God and His prophet have given us.”
The collected charities should go to the needy ones, the poor people, the administrators of the charities, those who sympathize with the Muslims, those who are heavily in debt, the travelers in distress and may be used in freeing the slaves as well as any God pleasing cause. This is how God wants it and God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
Some hypocrites hurt the prophet when they mockingly say: “This man believes in whatever people tell him” Respond: “Good for you that he does so.” Know that Mohammad believes in God and trusts the believers. He is a blessing for the true believers. Those who hurt him, should expect a painful punishment.
These hypocrites would like to please the Muslims by constantly swearing to God. If they were true believers, they would have tried to please God and His Messenger [by engaging in God pleasing acts rather than recourse to mere swearing.]
Do these hypocrites [who recourse to these silly actions] realize that the one who fights God and His Messenger will be condemned to eternal life in Hellfire, which is the greatest kind of humiliation?
The hypocrites are afraid that their secret thoughts (their secret resentment of Islam) might be announced in Qur’an. Say to them: “Go ahead and make a fun out of Islam [in your private gatherings.] God surely will let the people know what you harbor in your hearts.”
If you ask them [why there were making fun of God and religious matters], they (like today’s comedians) would say: “We were just kidding.” Say: “Kidding or not kidding; do you realize that you were making fun of God, His Revelations and His Messenger?”
Let them know that by engagement in such activities they have proven their lack of belief (after having accepted Islam.) If I decide to forgive some of them [in account of their stupidity], I will surely punish [the rest of] them as they are guilty ones.
The hypocrites (both men and women) are all of a kind: They invite people to evil deeds and forbid righteousness. Besides they are stingy. They have forgotten God and God has forgotten them. The hypocrites are indeed corrupt.
God hereby promises the Hellfire to the hypocrites (both men and women) and the disbelievers. They will stay in the Hell forever; it is the proper place for them. They are “blessed” with the Lord’s curse and will “enjoy” a continuous torture.
You (the hypocrites) are behaving like your predecessors. they were mightier than you and had more wealth and more children. They enjoyed their worldly life for a while. Like them, you also will enjoy your life for a while. Like them, you too are engaged in vain discussions. At the end all their deeds in this world, as well as [the repercussion of their deeds] in Hereafter, was nullified. They were true losers.
Have these people ever heard of the previous sinners such as the people of Noah, Thamud, Aad, the people of Abraham, the citizens of Midyan and the evil doers [of Sodom & Gomorrah]? Their prophets went to them with undeniable proofs (miracles.) God never did any injustice to them. It was they themselves who were unjust to their own souls.
As for the believing men and believing women, they are the guardian friends of each other. They encourage each other to do good deeds and forbid wrongdoings. They worship the Lord on regular basis, participate in charity and obey the Lord and His Messenger. God surely will shower them with His blessings; God is Almighty and the Most Wise.
God hereby promises the believing men and women the gardens beneath which the canals of water flow. They will live forever in the most magnificent mansions located in these gardens of Eden. Above all, God will be pleased with them and there is no achievement greater than this.
O’ Prophet, deal with the disbelievers and the hypocrites in a most decisive manner and do not yield to them. They will end up in the Hell which is the most horrible place.
They swear by God that they have never said such and such thing and they are lying. They have returned back to disbelief as they did not find the belief accommodating. They have rebelled in spite of the fact that God and His Messenger showered them with the Lord’s grace and material provisions. If they repent even now, there is still hope for them. If they do not come to their senses and do not repent, then God will punish them severely in this world and in the Hereafter and no power on the earth can come to their help.
Some of them pledged: “If the Lord increases our income, we will gladly contribute to the charity and lead a righteous life.”
But when God showered them with His blessings, they became stingy and did not fulfill their promises.
As a result of their lies, and reneging their pledges, God has planted the [disease of] hypocrisy so deep in their heart that it will follow them till the Day that they have to meet their Lord.
Do they not understand that God knows all their secrets and conspiracies? Do they not realize that God knows everything?
Those who criticize the well of believers for their generous contributions to the charities and make fun of the small contribution of the less fortunate ones (who offer them at the cost of sacrificing their necessities) should know that the Lord will make fun of them when He sentences them to painful punishments.
Whether you [the dear Messenger of God] pray for them or not, God will not forgive them. As a matter of fact, God will never forgive, nor guides, the corrupt people who choose to deny God and His Prophet even though you (Mohammad) pray for them seventy times.
The hypocrites who [came with all kind of excuses in order not to participate in the expedition to Tabuk and] were permitted to stayed behind, could not hide their happiness that they have lost the opportunity of pleasing God with their belongings and lives. They were openly saying to the people: “It is crazy to set forth in such a heat.” Say: “This heat is nothing compared to the Hellfire.” If only they knew.
Let them laugh a little bit as they are going to cry for the longest time; a punishment that they have earned.
If by any chance the Lord crosses the path of some of them with yours, and if they ask whether or not they can join you, say: “No way; You will never join me in fight with the enemies. You decided to stay at first place; therefore, go stay with those who chose to stay.”
If the hypocrite [who publicly pretends to be a Muslim] die, you (Mohammad) are forbidden to say the farewell prayer for them. You are not even allowed to pay a visit to their graves as they died when they were corrupt and had chosen to deny [in their hearts] the Lord and His Messenger.
Do not be impressed with their wealth and children. God has decided to punish them in this world by the mean of their very possessions and children and let them die in the state of disbelief (which is an automatic sentence to Hellfire, if God wills.)
Any time a verse is revealed saying: “Believe in God and strive hard with the Lord’s Messenger”, you might have noticed that even the most capable ones of them start to beg asking to be excused from the fight for the cause of God and say: “Please give us permission [for such and such reason] so that we stay behind, like those (handicaps, children and women) who stay at home.”
Their choice of staying behind, has led their hearts to be sealed; thus they are deprived of the faculty of understanding.
As to the Messenger, and those who joined in belief with him and strived hard with their possessions and their lives, theirs is the best and they are the true successful ones.
God has prepared for them the Gardens beneath which canals flow and they will live therein forever; this is the biggest achievement.
There were also some Arabs (living in the desert) who asked to be excused [from the expedition] and stay behind. Thus, they [showed their true color and] proved that they do not believe in God and His Messenger. Pretty soon they will receive a painful punishment.
There is no blame upon those who are weak, sick or cannot finance their participation in the fight to stay behind, so long as they are sincerely faithful to God and His Messenger. The righteous ones among them will bear no burden of shame as God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
Likewise, there is no blame upon those who came to you asking for the means of transportation and left with tears in their eyes as you did not have any horse or camel to accommodate them and they did not have any mean to provide it themselves either.
As for those who are rich enough to finance their participation in the expedition and still came to you asking your permission to stay behind with women, God has set a seal upon their hearts. Thus, they cannot understand [the repercussion of their cowardice behavior.]
When you return [from the battle], they will come to you with all kind of excuses [to justify their behavior.] Say: “Do not apologize as we do not believe you. God has already informed us what kind of people you are. God and His Messenger are going to keep an eye on you till you are summoned to the Lord Who knows everything; then He will inform you what you were doing.”
When you return, they will beg you that you leave them alone by the Grace of God. Break off all connections with them as they are nothing but filth. Their residence is Hell which they have earned it.
Their convincing oaths may calm you down but such corrupt people can never please the Lord.
The Arabs [Bedouins living in the desert surrounding Al-Medina] are worse in disbelief and hypocrisy. They will most likely stay away from a God pleasing way of life that Lord has revealed to His Messenger. God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
Some of these Bedouins consider their expenditures in the cause of God as a penalty [rather than an opportunity to buy their Hereafter.] They hope that some kind of disaster happen to you (so that they rebel against the established Islamic laws) Their wish will come true for themselves. [If they knew that] God hears everything [that they say] and knows everything [that they do and everything wich they earn for themselves.]
Among the Bedouins, there are also those who believe in God and the Last Day and consider their expenditure in the cause of God as a mean to bring them closer to the Lord and His acceptance of the Messenger’s prayer on their behalf. Thus, they earn the closeness to the Lord and God will surely admit them to His blessings as God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
As for those who were the first to respond to the invitation to the Faith, God is pleased with them (those who immigrated (to Al-Medina) as well as those who welcomed them with kindness to their town). They are pleased with the Lord too as God has prepared for them gardens beneath which canals flow and they will live therein for ever; what a great achievement.
Among the Arabs (living around Al-Medina) there are hypocrites [who pretended having embraced Islam in order to take advantage of its citizenship.] In Al-Medina, too, there are those who have mastered hypocrisy. You do not know that but I do know them. When the time comes, they will be subjected to double punishment (for their lack of belief and for their hypocrisy.) Once well punished, they will be sent to a far greater doom.
There are some other sinner who have come to their senses and asked for forgiveness. They have a mixture of good and evil deeds. God may forgive them as He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
Accept their charitable offerings (which may purify and cleanse them), guide them to the right path and pray for them as your prayers will comfort them; God hears everything and knows everything.
Do these people not know yet that it is only God Who accept His servants’ repentances and gives credit to their charitable contributions and that it is God Who is Forgiving and Merciful?
Say to them: “Feel free to do whatever you want. God witnesses your behavior, and so do His Messenger and the believers. Pretty soon you will return to the One Who knows everything in the realm of perception and beyond. Then He will re-run your life for you.
There are some whose actions have yet to surface so that God make a decision about them. He may either punish them or extend His Mercy to them: Rest assured that God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
There are some (hypocrites led by Abu Amir, the Christian monk, who eventually went to Rome and encouraged the Caesar to attack the newly established Islamic nation which led to the expedition to Tabuk by Prophet Mohammad) who built their own mosque to use it as a mean to harm the cause, spread disbelief and to cause a division between the believers. They are the ones who have declared war with God a long time ago. Although they swear that they have the best intention, God hereby declares that they are liars.
You should never attend that said mosque. The Mosque which was built the first day [of your entrance to Al-Medina] is founded upon piety and is the best place for you to worship the Lord. In this Mosque (Masjid Al-Nabavi) there are people who love to cleanse their souls and God loves those who engage in self-purification.
Is the one who has built his place of worship on the basis of the piety and the Lord’s approval better or the one who establishes his building on the brink of a crumbling cliff, that is going to fall down with him in the Fire of Hell. God indeed does not guide the unjust people.
The building that they have constructed will lead them to a lifetime doubt [and confusion] until they heart becomes insensitive to the truth; God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise (and consequently informs you of the truth.)
God, in a sense, has bought from the believers their souls (as they devote all their lives to a God pleasing way of life) and their belongings (that they devote to the charities and the cause of God) for the price of the Garden of Paradise. They fight in the way of God; they kill and are killed. The Lord’s promise (about the Paradise) is the truth. It is mentioned in Torah, Gospel and the Qur’an—and who fulfils his pledge better than God? Enjoy the deal that you have made with the Lord as this is the greatest achievement.
Give good news to the believers who ask forgiveness for their sins, worship the Lord, thank Him, meditate, bow down and fall prostrate in front of their Lord, encourage people to do good and forbid them of evil deeds and follow the Lord’s laws.
It is not fit for the Prophet, nor the believers, to beg God to forgive those who think that God has partners (even though the latter may be their dearest ones), when it has become obvious to them that they deserve Hell.
If Abraham said a prayer for his (idol worshipping) father, it was just in account of fulfilling a promise that he had made to him. As soon as Abraham realized that his father is an enemy of the Lord, he disowned him. The fact is that Abraham was a tenderhearted tolerant person.
It is not the Lord’s tradition to mislead a people (whom He has guided.) God first plainly explains to them what they should avoid [and if they do not listen to Him, then He will let them go deeper and deeper into the darkness.] God is fully aware of everything.
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He is the One Who brings the living species to life and takes their lives from them. You do not have any protector nor helper beside the Lord.
God has forgiven the Prophet (for permitting those who had the ability to go with him to the front to stay behind) and those local and immigrant believers who stood by him during the difficult time in spite of their initial hesitation. See how Kind and Merciful the Lord is.
God also showed mercy to those three who stayed behind (Ka’ab Ibn Malik, Hilal Ibn Ummaya and Murarah Ibn Ruba’i) after having made the earth (with all its vastness) to seem too narrow for them and after they completely gave up (they were boycotted even with their wives while waiting for the Lord’s decision.) Finally they learned (through this experience) that their only refuge is the Lord. The Lord then turned mercifully to them so that they may repent and then accepted their repentance as He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
O’ you who have believed, have the utmost respect for the Lord and be sincere to Him.
It was beneath the dignity of the people of Al-Medina and its suburban Arabs to abandon the Lord’s Messenger and (instead of supporting him) stay at home in order to take care of their worldly interests. They should know that any hardship such as hunger, thirst, physical pain (earned in the cause of God), as well as every step that they take toward enraging the disbelievers and every acts of theirs aimed to inflict a hardship upon the enemy will be credited to their account with God. Rest assured that God does not let go not rewarded the worthy deeds of the righteous people.
Any thing that they spend for the cause of God (be a little or a lot) and any step that they take to pass a valley (and go to the battle ground) will be credited to their account so that the Lord generously reward them for their deeds.
It was not required that all the believers should leave to the front. It would have been nice if, those who stayed behind, devote their time to learn more about Islam so that when their fellow tribesmen would return, share their findings with them and avoid sinful acts.
O’ believers, fight with the disbelievers who live in your vicinities so that they realize how serious you are. Rest assured that God is with the pious people.
Any time that a new chapter of Qur’an is revealed the disbelievers mockingly ask: “Did this increase your faith?” As a matter of fact, it increases the faith of the believers and make them rejoice.
As for those who have a disease in their heart, they become more and more filthy and they end up dying in the state of disbelief.
Do they not see that each year their faith is put to test once or twice. Yet they do not learn any lesson and do not repent (or adjust their attitudes.)
When a new chapter of Qur’an is revealed, they look at one another as though they say: “Is someone watching our (indifferent) reaction?” then they quietly leave. God has rendered their hearts insensitive [to His revelations] as they do not make any effort to understand.
Why do you not get it? Here you have a Messenger of God, chosen from among yourselves, who grieves at your spiritual loss, cares about you and is so gentle and compassionate toward the believers.
All this being said, if they turn away from you, say: “God suffices me. There is no deity beside the Lord. In God I put my trust; the Lord of mighty power.”
A.L.R. These are the words of the Most Wise Book.
Is it really a strange thing that I (God) should reveal my Words to an ordinary person (like Mohammad), in order to warn people of the consequence of their actions and to give good news to the believers about their rewards? Why that is then the disbelievers say: “This book is nothing but a sorcery?”
Your Creator is God: The One Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods. Then He assumed the control of His creation. Know that He is in control of everything. No one can intercede on behalf of someone else, before obtaining His permission to intercede first. Such is God your Creator. You should worship none but your Lord; Do you not get the message?
Every one will eventually return to God. This is the true promise of your Lord. His creation recreates itself so that He may reward those who [have been equal and similar in creation and have chosen to] believe and adopt a righteous way of life. As for those who choose the disbelief, they will end up to drink a boiling dirty liquid in Hell as a part of their awful punishment.
He is the One Who has made the sun a source of light and the moon to reflect the light. He has made the phases of moon extremely precise so that you may calculate your years and dates. God has not created all this [for fun] but for a specific purpose. See how clearly God explains His revelations for those people who contemplate.
Those who avoid the evils, [develop a faculty that enables them to] see [the natural phenomena such as] the appearance of the night after the passage of the day (as well as whatever God has created in the heavens and the earth) as the signs of the Lord (His existence and His greatness.)
Such singes do not mean anything to those who do not believe in their eventual meeting with Me, deeply engaged in their worldly affairs and [like the animals] content with their lives.
Such people will earn the Hellfire as their place to live.
As for those who have chosen to believe and do good deeds, their Lord will re-enforce their belief, which will lead them to the Paradise where the canals flow under its gardens.
In the Paradise they will pray: “Glory to the Lord.” They will be greeted with: “Peace” and their ultimate word of gratefulness will be: “Thank you, Lord of the universe.”
If the Lord had punished them in proportion to their deep involvement in the worldly affairs, their time would have come long time ago. Yet, I let those who do not believe in their meeting with Me to become deeper involved in their materialistic pursuit [and earn every bit of their punishment.]
When man find himself in an unpleasant situation, he begs Me (no matter in what position: standing, sitting or lying down.) As soon as I [answer his prayer and] relieve him from the hardship, he forgets My favor and goes back to his routine! The sinners’ behavior seems fair to them and is justified by them.
Do not forget that, before you, I destroyed [many] nations who had chosen the injustice [not the right path] as their way of life. They chose to disbelieve in their Messengers (whom I had sent with undeniable miracles.) I deal with the criminal people in such a manner [example: Sodom & Gomorrah.]
Now, after them, I have put you in charge on earth to see how you will do.
When My straight forward commandments are communicated to them, those (who do not believe that they will meet Me one day) say: “Why do you not fabricate another Qur’an and put in it such and such things to please us?” Answer: “I have not fabricated this Qur’an so that I may re-write it. I do not follow nothing but what is revealed to me. Indeed I am afraid of disobeying my Lord’s commandments and be sentenced to a punishment on the most awesome Day.”
Say: “If it was not the will of God, I would not have recited any part of this Book to you. You would not even have known about the existence of such a Book. I have lived among you for the longest time [and you know my character and believe in me as a truthful person.] Why do you not use your common-sense?”
“Who is more evil than the one who fabricates a lie [that you are asking me to do] and then ascribe it to the Lord? Who is more evil than the one who rejects the Lord’s commandments [the way that you are doing]? Such a criminal can never achieve the real success (i.e., earning his place in Paradise.)
Those people, instead of worshipping God alone, worship the idols who can neither harm nor benefit them. They say: “These are intermediary between the Lord and us and will ask God to forgive us.” Reply: “Do you want to say that you are aware of the creatures that God Himself is not aware of neither in the heavens nor on earth?” Glory to the Lord; He is far above needing partners.
The people were used to belong to only one nation; then they created opposing communities. If it was not the pre-determined will of God (to let them keep their freedom of choice), He would have immediately judged among them [and would have prevented their separation.]
They say: “How come Mohammad’s Lord has not sent a miracle as a sign for his prophet hood?” Reply: “The Lord is the Master of the world of unseen [it is up to Him to bless me with a miracle or not. Besides, did such undeniable miracles of the previous prophet change the attitude of their people?] Well, wait (for this undeniable miracle that you are looking for.) I, too, will wait with you (for the completion of the biggest miracle of all, i.e., this Qur’an.)
When I show mercy and save people from a disaster (as the sea was opened to provide a safe passage for the Jews), they [forget such miracle (as the Jews forgot the pass over and started to worship the statue of a cow) and] start devising evil plans against My Revelations [like early Christians who put aside the Lord’s Revelations (presented to them in “Gospel According to Jesus Christ”) and devised their own gospels.) Say to them: “God will devise much more effective plans for you as He has ordered your plans to be written down (and presented against you in the most appropriate time.)
You are the same people who enjoy the pleasant wind which moves your ships in the sea. Then, when a strong storm blows upon you from every side, you start begging from the bottom of your heart for a “miracle” and promise that you will be My sincere servants.
When the Lord [miraculously] saves you, however, you [go back to your old tricks and] rebel against the Truth. Know that this rebellion of yours harms only your own souls. You are so preoccupied with this world that you forget [that pretty soon] you have to return to your Lord [and imagine the embarrassment at the moment] when your actions are played back to you at the presence of your Lord.
The [instability of the] life in this world can be exemplified by the following [true] story: Once upon a time, I sent rain from the sky which caused the crops (which sustains man and animals equally) cover the earth. Then, at the height of the abundance (when the land owners were happy, presuming that they are going to be blessed with an unusual profit), I sent a catastrophe (in the night or the day [whichever you choose]) that all of a sudden destroyed the whole land as though nothing existed there before. See how clearly I make my points for those people who contemplate.
God invites you to a peaceful place (not an instable place like earth as mentioned above.) He guides whoever He wills (and deserves) to the right path.
Those who have done many good deeds (and earned their Lord’s guidance to the straight path) their rewards will be multiplied [and they will receive much more than they deserve.] Their faces will not reflect any sadness nor disgrace (on the Day of Judgment.) They will live forever in the Paradise.
As for those who earned sins, their punishment will be proportional to their wrongdoings (and not many folded like the reward of the righteous people.) They will realize that there is none to save them from the punishment of the Lord. Disgrace will cover them and their face will turn black; as black as the darkness of the night. They were wrong to their souls and have to pay for it by staying in the Hell forever.
On the Day that they are all raised, I will ask them: “Where are those whom you referred to as My partners?” Once they confront their gods, the latter will say: “We did not have the least idea that you were worshipping us!”
“We take God [Who is the best Witness] as our Witness that we did not have the least idea that you were worshipping us.”
On that Day, every soul will taste what he has earned. Every one will be brought to the presence of his Lord and the gods that they themselves invented, will abandon them.
Ask them: “Who provides your means of existence from the sky above (such as oxygen for breathing and rain for cultivation) and the earth below (such as food and running water?) Who has given you the ability to hear and to see? Who makes life appear from death and replaces death with life?” They will answer: “God.” Say: “Why then you do not respect the Lord (and do not obey His Commandments?)”
As you admit, your true Lord is God. If you are not following the truth, you are naturally following what is wrong. Why are you then following those who are misleading you?
These are the true words of your Lord to the corrupt people. What a shame that they do not choose to believe.
Ask the disbelievers: “Which one of those whom you worship is capable of creating something out of nothing and then let it recreate itself?” Say: “God is the One Who originates the creation and then [put a mechanism in it and] let it re-produce itself.”
Ask the disbelievers: “Which one of those whom you worship guides you to the truth?” Say: “It is only God alone who guides you to the truth.” This being clearly stated, ask them: “Who is more worthy to be followed: He Who guides to the truth or the one who cannot guide, unless he himself be guided? What is wrong with you that you cannot use your straight sense of judgment?”
The fact of the matter is, most of them base their lives on false assumptions. Such assumptions then cannot guide them to the truth [and they are led to evil deeds] and God is aware of their evil deeds.
This Qur’an is impossible to have been authored by none but the Lord. It confirms [the intact part of] the previous Scriptures and fully explains the Book [that God has authored to be used as a hand book for mankind’s salvation.] Without any doubt, it is sent by the Lord of the universe.
To those who say: “Qur’an is authored by man” say: “write a chapter similar to its chapters and ask for anybody’s help, if you really believe in what you say.”
The fact of the matter is, they have rejected Qur’an without studying it or contemplating about its verses. The previous disbelievers did the same thing and see where they ended up.
Some of these disbelievers believe in the Qur’an’s divine source (and eventually will embrace Islam) and some do not believe in it. Let it be known that God is fully aware of those who have chosen corruption as their way of life.
If the disbelievers insist that you are an imposter, say to them: “We are each responsible for our deeds. I am not accountable for what you do and you will not be held responsible for what I do.”
Among the disbelievers, they are those who (due to their prejudices, have already made up their mind not to hear what you say but) just listen. Can you make the deaf (who is also suffering from lack of understanding) to hear what you say?
Some of them look at you; but can you make such blind people who are deprived of the ability of seeing to see?
The fact of the matter is, God is never unjust to people (as He has already sent this Qur’an as a sign of His justice and mercy.) They are people themselves who are unjust to themselves (and not obey the Lord’s commandments.)
The Day that people are raised, they will have the feeling that they lived on earth for only a few hours in order to become acquainted with each other. The disbelievers among them (who did not believe in their meeting with the Lord) will then realize how much of a looser they have been for not earning the guidance.
It does not matter whether You live long enough to see how they will pay for their evil deeds or not live long enough to witness it. The fact of the matter is, they have to return to Me so that I show what evils they have been doing.
Every nation is blessed with a prophet (to tell them what is right and what is wrong.) They will be tried at the presence of their own prophet so that no one be unjustly sentenced (for not having heard the truth.)
They [open their mouths without thinking and] say: “If you are truthful, subject us to this awful punishment that you are threatening with [not realizing that if they receive the punishment, there will be no time left for avoiding it which is exactly why the prophets are sent.]
Say to them: “I do not have any power of my own to materialize my wishful thinking or to prevent any hardship which I am destined to go through. Whatever is the Will of Lord will happen. Every nation has a destiny; when its time come, it will neither be postponed nor advanced.”
Say to them: “Suppose the Lord’s punishment [that you are asking to be subjected to as a proof of the existence of God] comes upon you (all of a sudden, at night or during the day), What are you going to do to save yourselves from such punishment then?” Why is it that these criminals are anxious to be sentenced to the punishment as soon as possible?
If you see your doom with your own eyes, will you believe then? But how can you then escape from an inescapable event that you asked to happen to you?
When the criminals are subjected to their punishment, they will be told: “Now taste this everlasting torture. What else did you expect to earn for your evil deeds?”
They will ask then: “Is what you say really true?” Respond: “By my Lord it is absolutely true, and you can do nothing to escape from it.”
Every soul, who has been unjust to himself, will gladly pay whatever in the world he owns, to escape from his doom. When they feel the torture that they have to go through, they will be absolutely sorry for what they have done. They will be judged fairly without the least injustice.
The fact of the matter is, whatever there is in the heavens and the earth belongs to the Lord. Know that the Lord’s word is true. What a shame that most disbelievers do not believe Him.
God is the One Who gives life and takes the life away and to Him you will all return.
O’ mankind, God, hereby, has sent you the Admonition so that you use it as guidance (a set of criteria to distinguish right from wrong.) It is the remedy for your sick souls and indicates how merciful the Lord is to those who choose to believe in Him.
Say: “It is in account of the generosity and mercy of the Lord that you have received this Qur’an. May them enjoy it as it is better than what they come up with themselves (such as civil laws.)
Say to them: “Have you ever contemplated how God provides all kind of things that your life depends upon them? How come then you make some of them lawful and some of them unlawful for yourselves? Is your decision (to make some lawful and some unlawful) based upon the Lord’s commandments? Why are you falsely ascribing your fabrications to the Lord?”
What kind of reward these liars (who ascribe their fabrications to the Lord) expect to receive from God on the Day of Resurrection? God is so generous to mankind; what a shame that most of the are so ungrateful.
God witnesses whatever you (Mohammad) do; be it reciting from the Qur’an or getting yourself into a situation. God also witnesses whatever everyone else does. There is nothing hidden from the Lord; be it an atom or something, smaller (sub-atomic particles), or bigger than that (the galaxies.) Everything is registered in the Book (computer) of God.
Rest assured that the Lord’s friends will not be touched by grief or sadness (in Hereafter.)
These are those who believed in God and approached Him with the utmost respect.
For such people there is good news (which gives them peace of mind) in this world and joy and happiness in Hereafter. God’s words cannot be changed (neither He changes it nor let man to change it.) Such people have achieved the greatest success.
Do not let their remarks put you down. What really counts is the honor that you receive from the Lord (and not a medal or a word of praise from a person.) God Hears and knows everything.
Know that all creatures in the heavens and on the earth belong to God. Those who worship others beside God, follow nothing but their fantasies. They have based their lives upon mere assumptions.
God is the One Who created the night so that you rest and brightened up the day. Those who listen, find the Lord’s signs in these [taken for granted] phenomena.
They say: “God has begotten a son!” Glory to the Lord, He is rich [and like poor mankind is not in need of a child.] To God belongs everything which is in the heavens and on the earth. You have no proof to support such a nonsense. Why do you ascribe something to God while you do not have any knowledge of the subject matter?
Say: “Those who fabricate such lies and ascribe them to the Lord, will never succeed.”
Such people will enjoy the world for a while and then will return to Me. I will then subject them to the most sever punishment for their choosing the disbelief.
Recite to them the story of Prophet Noah (as a reminder and a warning.) He said to his people: “Brothers, if you find my position here among you (and my repeated references to the Lord’s revelations) too annoying for you, then I have a suggestion for you. Get together with your leaders, sentence me to whatever you decide. Tell me about your decision immediately [and do not worry about me] as I have put my trust in the Lord.
If you have decided to disregard the Lord’s commandments, [it will not make me broke as] I have never expected a compensation for my services for you. My compensation is being paid by God and He has ordered me to be a Muslim (an Arabic word which means submitter to the commandments of the Lord.)
Thus, they chose to disbelieve. I saved Noah and those who joined him in the arc and let them to inherit the earth. I drowned those who disregarded My Commandments. Note the consequences; they had already been warned.
After Noah, I sent many prophets to his people. They presented undeniable miracles to them, but how can one believe in what he has decided to deny? Thus I seal the hearts of those who pass the limits.
Later I sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his administrators. They were bunch of guilty people who dealt arrogantly with my Revelations.
When the truth was presented on My behalf to them, their only response was: “These are clearly the sorceries.”
Moses said: “Is this the way that you deal with the truth when it is presented to you? Is this magic? The magician cannot (boldly challenge a mighty king and) succeed?”
They replied: “Have you come to change our style of life which we have inherited from our forefathers? You want to earn a superior position the same way that Joseph earned his way up.] We will not believe in what you say.”
The Pharaoh said: “Gather the most renown magicians.”
When the magician gathered, Moses said: “Come with your best tricks.”
When they were through with their acts, Moses said: “You put a good show of magic on the stage. Now God is going to reveal your tricks; He never supports the mischief makers’ plans.”
God establishes the truth with His Words [so that the reason prevail], despite the fact that the criminals resent it (the reasoning)
What a shame that none believed in Moses except a few youths of his own people. They were afraid of Pharaoh and his administrators’ vindication. Surely, Pharaoh was an arrogant tyrant and the most extravagant.
Moses admonished his people saying: “If you believe in God, put your trust in Him. This is the way the Muslims (meaning submitters in Arabic) behave.”
They replied: “ O’ Lord, we put our trust in you. Please [make our trial easy and] do not try us in hardship caused by the persecution of these unjust people.”
“Lord, please have mercy and save us from these disbelieving people (of Pharaoh.)”
I ordered Moses and his brother: “For the moment, devote a few houses of yours for the performance of religious ceremonies. Start worshipping the Lord on regular basis there and let the believers know that the good days are approaching.”
Moses (probably in one of these congregational prayers) said: “ Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his officer’s wealth and luxuries in this world. O Lord, they use their power to push the people off your path. Lord, may you destroy their wealth and make their hearts the most insensitive to the truth so that they refuse to believe and, in consequence, be subjected to the severest punishment.”
I replied: “Your request has been granted. Show patience and do not follow the paths paved by the ignorant people.”
Eventually, I led the children of Israel across the [Red] sea. Then Pharaoh and his army followed them [through the passage opened in the sea] with the hostile intention. When Pharaoh was drowning [due to the closure of the passage by the permission of the Lord], he said: “Now I believe that there is no deity but the Lord in whom the children of Israel have believed. Thus, I declare myself to be a Muslim (submitted to the commandments of God.)”
It was declared: “Now you believe! It is too late, [you had your choice and] you chose rebellion and corruption.”
“Today, [instead of your soul] your dead body will be saved (still in existence in the form of a mummy) to serve as an example for the succeeding generations. What a shame that most people totally ignore My Signs.”
Then I let the children of Israel settle in a wonderful land and provided the life’s purest necessities for them. Unfortunately, they started to dispute among themselves, in spite of the knowledge that I had showered them with. For sure, your Lord will pass His Judgment upon them on the Day of Resurrection and will bring to their attention the real reasons for which they were disputing.
If you doubt the Divine source of this Book, consult those who have read the previously revealed Scriptures. You will then realize that the Lord has revealed the Truth to you. Therefore, do not doubt a bit.
Do not join the losers who chose to disregard the Lord’s Commandments.
Those who (in account of their attitude) have already been condemned by God, will never believe.
No matter what is presented to them, they will keep on denying. They will believe only when they face the Fire.
There was only one community, among the evil doers, who chose to repent and take advantage of the Lord’s mercy; and that was the people of Jonah. When they chose to answer My call, I removed their sufferings and let them enjoy their worldly lives.
If it was the will of your Lord, all people of the earth would have believed (yet He wants to try them with their freedom of choice.) Do you still think you can make them all to believe?
No soul will believe unless [he proves himself to the Lord and then] God showers him with the blessing of the belief. Those who do not use their faculty of thinking are nothing but the trash in the sight of the Lord.
Say to them: “Observe (the main principle of scientific inquiry) what is in the heavens and the earth.” What a shame that all these proofs and warnings will not lead the people to believe.
What are the disbelievers waiting for (to believe?) Are they waiting for the evil days experienced by the previous generations [of the evil-doers?] Say to them: “Wait, I am waiting too [ and let us see who will have the last laugh.]”
When the day of punishment arrives, I will save My Messenger and those who have joined him. This is the way that I have chosen to operate. thus I will save the believers.
Say: “O mankind, If you have any doubt about how faithful I am, know that I do not worship those whom you worship beside the Lord. I worship only that God who has the power to take your lives away. I have been ordered to be a believer.”
I am commanded: “Dedicate yourself to this Faith like an upright man and do not join those who worship beside the Lord.”
“Invoke none beside God as they have no power and can neither harm you nor be of any benefit to you. If you do so, you have joined those who have been unjust to their own souls.”
If God decides that you have to go through a hardship, none except He Himself can remove it. Likewise, If He decides to shower you with a blessing, none can deprive you of that favor. He favors whoever among His servants that He wishes; He is the Most Forgiving, He is the Most Merciful.
Say: “O mankind, the truth has been revealed to you by your Lord. Whoever takes advantage of this guidance, has been good to himself. Whoever chooses the disbelief, has simply been unjust to his own soul. I (Mohammad) am not appointed as a guardian over you.”
Follow what is revealed to you and be patient till God passes His Judgment and God is the best Judge.
A.L.R. Qur’an is a firm Book [which is well-balanced, strong, and unchangeable. It mentions only the truth.] In its verses, God, the Most Wise, the Most Knowledgeable, Himself explain the Message in detail.
Proclaim: “Man shall not worship except His Creator; I (Mohammad) am only the Lord’s Messenger and my mission is to relay the Lord’s warning, as well as, good news (about a peaceful life after death) to mankind.”
“Ask for your Lord’s forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. May He generously reward you in this life and shower those who deserve it with His blessings. If you turn away from the right path, I dread the horrible punishments which you will be sentenced to on the Day of Judgment.”
Know that you will return to your Lord (after death.) God is capable of doing whatever He decides to do.
Some avoid Mohammad in order not to hear the truth. They should know that they cannot hide themselves from God. Even when they cover themselves with cloths, God knows what is hidden inside them and reads their innermost thoughts. He knows what they keep as secrets and what they publicly reveal.
There is no creature on earth for whom God has not appointed a provision (which he needs to survive.) God knows where/ how they live and where/ how they hide themselves. Everything is registered in a profound record (the Lord’s computer.)
God is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six days. His (earthly) domain was completely covered with water. He has provided this [hospitable] world for your trial (so that you prove yourself to Him and learn by going through hardships) and see which one of you will do his best. If you (Mohammad) let them know that they will be raised after death, their only response will be: “This man is talking witchcraft.”
If I [out of mercy] postpone the most severe punishment which they have earned (and is reserved for certain communities (such as Sodom & Gomorrah)), they will start making fun and say: “How come our punishment is delayed?” If they knew how their mocking will come back to haunt them, when they get their punishment.
Man becomes desperate and (like a rotten child) acts ungratefully when I (as a part of his trial) deprive him of a privilege that I had entitled him to.
If after the hardship, I shower him with My blessings, he will say: “Good bye bad times.” then he shows [excessive] happiness and pride.
Only those are free from such vices that show patience and do good deeds. These are the ones who are entitled to My forgiveness and a great reward.
Be extremely careful as you may be tempted to forget about some of My Commandments [that you, personally may not like them.] Also, do not take it personally when the disbelievers mockingly say: “What kind of a Prophet is this man who does not have any treasure at his disposition nor any angel under his commandment.” Remember, you are only a Warner and it is God Who is in charge.
When they say: “He has fabricated this Qur’an”, reply: “If this Qur’an is a book that can be fabricated, then I challenge you to fabricate only ten similar chapters, with the help and consultation of whoever you choose.”
Now, if those whom you idolize, cannot help you, come to conclusion that this Qur’an is revealed with the knowledge of God and that there is no god beside Him, Now, will you choose to submit yourself to the commandment of the Lord and call yourselves Muslims?
Those who prefer this world and are fascinated by its vanities, will get whatever they desire from it.
However, they should know that, nothing but the Fire is waiting for them in the Hereafter; their deeds are nullified and whatever they do [is worldly oriented and therefore] will be worthless.
You know this person who based his belief upon the contents of Qur’an. He found that this Book is self-explanatory and that it comes from the Lord and like the Book of Moses (which was revealed before) is a guidance and the blessing from God for the believers. As for those who choose to disregard it, they will end up in the Hell as promised. Do not harbor any doubt about in your heart. Qur’an is Truth and revealed by your Lord. What a shame that most people do not realize it.
After all, who can be more unjust (which was not the case of Mohammad as he was known to be the most trustworthy among the Arabs) than the one who forges something and then claims that it is revealed by God? Such person will be prosecuted by the Lord [on the Day of Judgment.] He will find witnesses against himself who will testify: “This man falsified a revelation.” Beware! The unjust people are already cursed by God.
An unjust person is the one who does not believe in the Hereafter and confuses the people by portraying a crooked image of the Lord’s straight path.
The unjust people will fail to overcome the Lord on the earth and will find that there is none to protect them from the Lord in the Hereafter. Their punishment will be doubled for the simple reason that they failed to hear and to see.
They are those who wronged their soul and their inventions (false theories, false gods, etc.) will be destroyed with them.
Beyond any shadow of the doubt they will be the worse losers in the Hereafter.
As for those who chose to believe, did good deeds and devoted themselves to their Lord, they will reach Paradise, wherein there will live for ever.
The above mentioned groups are not equal for the same token that a deaf and blind person is not equal to the one who sees and hears. Would you contemplate and learn from this example?
I sent Noah to his people [as my Messenger.] He said: “I have come to you with a plain warning.”
“Do not worship but God. I hate to see you being sentenced to an awful punishment in a nasty day.
The leaders of the disbelievers responded: “You are a human being like us; your followers are bunch of low life people; you do not have my superiority; therefore, you are nothing but a bunch of liars.”
He replied: “Consider this: What if after having observed the signs of the [the existence and oneness] of the Lord in the nature, God (out of His mercy) has revealed the truth only to me [so that I present it to you? Is such thing impossible?] Are we forcing you to accept it?”
“My people, I am not asking you for any compensation [for this most valuable service of mine.] Lord will pay me for that. I do not mistreat the believers [the way that you treat them.] After all, they have to meet their Lord [and complain about being mistreated.] The ignorant people like you have my pity.”
“And if I [listen to you and] disperse the believers [whom you treat as “low lives”] who is going to save me from the Lord [for doing that?] Why do you not get it?”
“I do not pretend that I own the Lord’s treasures, nor that I have knowledge over everything. I can neither satisfy you by saying: “God has not favored those who [have chosen to believe and that you] resent so much.” God know what kind of persons they are; It will be unjust of me to say something [nasty about] them [to satisfy your ego.]”
The Noah’s people finally said: “Noah, You have lectured us more than enough (for year!) Enough is enough. If you are right in what you claim, then bring upon us that “awful punishment” that you are talking about.”
Noah replied: “If God wills, He will subject you to His punishment and you [who are making fun of this] cannot win the war that you have declared to God.”
“Even if I wanted to give a well wished lecture, now it is too late for you to benefit from it. After all, when God wants to send someone [who has earned the Lord’s displeasure] to the wrong path, none can re-direct them to the right path. But know that He is your Lord and to Him you will return.”
The disbelievers say that you (Mohammad) have invented this Qur’an. Reply: “I am innocent of such a crime; If I commit such a terrible crime, the Lord will severely punish me.”
And I said to Noah: “Apart from those who have already chosen to believe, no one else from your people will join you in belief. Therefore, never mind what they are doing.”
“Start to build an arc under My watchful eyes and according to the revelations that you are going to receive. Do not ask Me to forgive the disbelievers as they are already sentenced to be drawn.”
Then Noah started to build the arc. Every time that the chieftain of his people would pass by, they would make fun of him. His reply was: “Go on, continue laughing. We are also making fun of you (for your ignorance) the same way that you are making fun of us.”
“Soon you will see who will be humiliated by a painful punishment and who will be sentenced to an everlasting punishment.”
When The time approached, the springs began to gush up from the earth (and the heavy rain poured down constantly.) Then I said: “Take into the Arc a pair from every species, your family members (except the ones who are condemned) and those who have chosen to believe (which were few in number) to join you.”
Noah said: “Come on board; in the name of God it will sail and cast anchor. Indeed my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.”
As the Arc was sailing through the waves (which were as high as the mountains), Noah cried at his son (who was struggling in a distance): “Come and join us in the Arc and forget about the disbelievers.”
His son replied: “Do not worry about me, I will climb up the [highest] mountain to find in safety from the water.” Noah said: “Today, nothing can protect anyone from the Lord’s judgment. Only those will be saved who deserve His Mercy. Then a big wave separated the father from the son and the latter drowned.”
It was commanded: “O earth swallow up your water. O sky, stop raining.” Then the water sank into the earth. Thus, the ordeal came to its end and the Ark rested upon Mt. Judea. It was then proclaimed: “The era of unjust people is now over.”
Noah prayed to his Lord, saying: “Lord, my son is a member of my family [and you have promised to save my family members;] your promise is always fulfilled [would you save him now?] I beg you as the best of judges.
I said: “Noah, he is not a member of your family as he [is carrying the wrong genes and consequently) is doing nothing but wrong. Therefore, do not ask for something that you have any knowledge about it. Do not behave like ignorant people (who think the criminals are human beings and should not be destroyed.)”
Noah replied: “Lord, I apologize about begging for something that I do not have the least knowledge about it. Now, if you do not accept my apology and have no mercy on me, I will find myself in line with the losers.”
I replied: “Noah, you may leave the Arc now. Peace and My blessings will be with you and your people (and the generations who will follow them.) As for other [disbelieving] nations, I will let them enjoy their appointed lifetime [lifetime in this world] and then subject them to a painful punishment.
O’ Mohammad, these are some of the historical facts [that now have become a part] of the unseen which I reveal to you. Neither you, nor your people, knew about it before this. Be patient, [it is the law of the Lord that] the final victory belongs to those who respect the Lord.
As for the people of Ad, I appointed their brother Hood as a Prophet. He said to them: “My people, worship only the Lord as you do not have any other god beside Him. Any other god [that you believe in] is just a fabrication of yours.”
“O’ my people, I am not asking any compensation for this service of mine to you. The same God who originated me will reward me. Why do you not get it?”
“My people, ask for your Lord’s forgiveness and promise Him that you will not repeat your sins. God, then, will shower you with provisions from the sky and make you a strong nation. Do not repeat your sins.”
They replied: “O Hood, you have come with no clear miracle. We do not give up our gods because you say so. We simply do not believe in you.”
“We think that some of our gods have put a jinx on you.” Hood replied: “I take you and the Lord as my witness that [there is only One God and that] I do not believe in your [fabricated] gods.”
“There is no god beside Him. Now do whatever you want to me.”
“I put my trust in God Who is my Lord and yours as well. There is not a creature which escapes his authority. The right path is the path indicated by the Lord.”
“Now that I have relayed the Message, the choice is yours. If you do not obey my Lord, He will replace you with another nation and you cannot hurt Him the least as my Lord is in complete control.”
When I decreed My Sentence, I saved Hood and those who joined him in belief. It was only in account of My Mercy that they escaped such an awful punishment.”
Such was the end of Ad; people who rejected their Lord’s revelations, disobeyed His Messengers, and supported their tyrants.
They were doomed in this world (and in the Hereafter as well) because they disregarded their Lord. Thus was perished Ad, the people of Hood.
And to Thamud, I appointed their brother Saleh. He said: “O’ my people, worship the Lord as you do not have any other god beside Him. He raised you from the earth and sustained you therein. Pray for forgiveness from your Lord and repent sincerely; you will find the Lord very close to you and the Most Forgiving.
They replied: “O Saleh, you used to be such a nice person. Now you are asking us not to worship what our fathers have worshipped for generations? We are having second thought about you; you make us feel uncomfortable.
Saleh said: “Suppose for the sake of argument that I am sincere in saying that my Lord has sent me with undeniable signs and that He has showered me with His mercy, then who will save me from His punishment, if I join you in His disobedience? The only thing that I will earn for pleasing you is my doom.”
“By the way, God has asked you not to bother this camel that I am indicating to you [as a symbolic gesture of His obedience.] Let this camel roam in the land freely and do not touch her with an evil intention; otherwise, you will be punished immediately.”
They killed the camel (proving that they are not willing to follow even a symbolic commandment of God which is revealed to test their obedience.) Saleh said: “Listen carefully; you have only three days to live (an excellent opportunity to repent.) This is a true prophecy.”
When they were being subjected to My Punishment, I saved Saleh (and those who had joined him in belief) out of mercy and spared them from the humiliating punishment of that Day. Yes; your Lord is Powerful, Almighty.
As for those who were unjust [to their own souls,] a powerful blast overtook them in their houses and instantly killed them.
The blast was so disastrous that you would think no one had ever lived there before. The people of Thamood did not obey their Lord; the people of Thamood were destroyed.
There came My Messengers to Abraham (in the form of human beings) to relay some good news. They said: “Peace be with you [which is the greeting phrase for Muslims (those who obey the Lord.)] Abraham responded: “Peace be also upon you (not Hi, Good day, etc.)” Abraham then prepared a roasted calf for them (to show the highest hospitality, not knowing yet that they were the Lord’s Angels.)
When Abraham saw that they did not extend their hands to eat, he became suspicious and fear overtook him. They said: “Do not be afraid; we are on our way to visit the people of Ad.”
When they gave him the good news (that he will have Isaac [as his son] and Jacob [as his grand son,]) his wife (who was present) burst into laugh.
She said: “A son from an old couple like us will be really something!”
The angels replied: “Do you doubt the power of God? He has decided to shower you and your family with His blessings and mercy. The Lord is indeed Praiseworthy and Glorious.”
When Abraham overcome his initial shock and enjoyed the good news, he began to plea for the people of Lot.
What a tender-hearted and merciful servant was Abraham. He would always keep Me in mind.
“Abraham, forget about them. Your Lord’s unchangeable sentence is already issued and they must be tortured.”
When My Messengers [left Abraham and] reached to Lut, He felt very bad [about the way that they had been treated by his people] and was disappointed that he is powerless [and, therefore, cannot protect them.] He said: “What a tough day today is.”
Then Lut faced with a bunch of thugs who wanted to break into his house [and have sex with his guests] as they were deeply corrupt. Lut said: “My people, take my daughters instead as they are more natural for your purpose. Fear God and do not humiliate me in front of my guests. Is there not a real man among you?”
They said: “You know that we do not have the least desire for your daughters and you know exactly what we want.”
Lut angrily said: “I wish I were strong enough [to deal with you personally] or had someone strong with me [so that he punishes you.]
The angels said: “Lut, we are your Lord’s Messengers. Do not worry about them; they cannot harm you at all. Take your family and leave the town in these last hours of the night. Do not let none look behind except your wife who will be punished like everyone else in this town. The punishment will start early morning. Hurry up as the morning is approaching.”
When the time arrived, I turned the town upside down [by an earthquake] and showered them with baked clay type of stones (probably caused by a volcanic eruption) one after another.
Each stone was already destined to hit a given person. May the disbelievers [listen to this story and] realize that they [are not immune and that they] may be soon subjected to such a punishment.
As to the people of Median, I appointed their brother Shu’aib as My Messenger. He said: “O my people, Worship none but God as you do not have any other lord beside Him. Quit this habit of cheating people when you measure or weight. I see you a prosperous people now, but I am afraid that the continuation of your behavior will lead to a sudden doom day for you.”
“My people, give full measure and full weight, do not defraud people of their gods and do not spread corruption on earth.”
“By Lord a small profit (rightfully earned) is better for you (than a larger profit obtained through cheating,) if you have any belief. Anyhow [the choice is yours,] I am not a guardian over you.”
They replied: “Tell us Shu’aib, does your kind of worshipping the Lord mean that we have to abandon our forefathers’ religion and that we should give up our freedom of choice in the manner that we trade or do whatever we want with our properties? Then you are the only generous (,liberal, romantic) and righteous man [left in our community!]”
Shu’aib said: “For the sake of argument, imagine that God (beyond the shadow of the doubt) has revealed the truth to me. In addition, He has showered me with His best blessings. How can I, then (just in order to please you) join you in your evil practices? No way, I will never do what I forbid you to do. My only desire is to reform you and I will do my best to achieve this goal. My success in this enterprise completely depends on God in Whom I have put my trust and to Whom I have submitted full heartedly.”
“O’ my people, let not your opposition to me lead you to adoom that the peoples of Noah, Hud and Saleh were subjected to. What happened to the people of Hud (the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah) is a recent event.”
“Apologize to God and promise that you will never do the evil deeds that you are addicted to. The Lord is Merciful and Kind.”
They replied: “What you say (to give up our freedom and submit ourselves to the “tyranny” of God) does not make any sense to us. You are a powerless person among us. If it were not for your family, we would have stoned you to death long time ago. You are too insignificant to impose your desire upon us.”
Shu’aib said: “You mean that your fear of my family (which prevents you from stunning me) is more than your fear of God (which does not prevent you of His disobedience!) Is it why you disregard the Lord (or do you think that God does not see you)? Rest assured that God is aware of anything that you do.”
“Well, do whatever you want and I will do whatever I believe to be proper. Pretty soon we will see which one of us will be subject to a humiliating torture and who the liar is. Wait if you will and I, too, will wait in anticipation along with you.”
When I passed My Sentence, I saved Shu’aib and those who joined him in faith. The wrongdoers were struck by a disaster that left them dead in their homes.
It was as though they never existed. That was the end of the Midyan’s civilization. It came to an end the same way that the civilization of Thamood came to its end.
As to Pharaoh and his officers, I sent Moses with undeniable miracles and delegated authority.
Unfortunately, the people of Pharaoh chose to follow the Pharaoh’s commands; and his commands were not wise.
On the Day of Resurrection, He will lead his people all the way to Hell. What a miserable place to be led to.
The curse that they earned in this world will last even in Hereafter. what an thing to earn.
These are the stories of the past communities that I inform you of. Some of those nations still exist while the others completely vanished.
I was not unfair to them. It was they, themselves, who wronged their own souls. The lords that they had invented, was of the least help to them when the sentence of your Lord was carried. As a matter of fact, it was those same false lords that ensured their doom.
Such is the way that your Lord punishes the unjust nations. Know that His punishment is sever and painful.
Such punishment is imposed as a lesson for those who mind the punishment of the Last Day. A Day when all people will be gathered together to witness its events.
The Last Day (which is not too far away) will take place at its appointed time.
On that Day none will be able to speak without the Lord’s permission. Some will be miserable and some will be happy.
As for those who will be miserable, they will be thrown in the Fire. Their reaction will be nothing but sighs and tears.
They will “live” in the Hell as long as the heavens and the earth shall last, unless your Lord decides otherwise as it is the Lord Who [makes the laws and] may do whatever He wants.
As for those who will be happy (on the Day of Judgment), they will end up in the heavens wherein they will live as long as the heavens and the earth shall last, unless your Lord decides otherwise. They will be blessed with an everlasting reward.
Therefore, do not have any doubt about [the ineffectiveness of] the lords that they worship. They simply blindly follow the footstep of their forefathers. I will give them exactly what they have earned without reducing the least from it.
I blessed Moses with the Scripture, but it was disputed. If it was not in account of a decision of the Lord [not to intervene and see how they will behave], the matter would have been solved long time ago (and the trouble makers would have been punished.) Thus, they are in doubt about it (the authenticity of their Scripture.)
Your Lord will punish them according to their deeds without reducing the least from it as He is aware of what they are doing.
Therefore you (Mohammad) and those who have repented [learn from this and] stick firmly to the right way [as revealed here in Qur’an] and do not disobey as the Lord sees all you do.
Do not lean the least towards those who have chosen the disobedience as you may be attracted to the Hell. In that case you will find none to protect you against the Lord and you will end up losers.
You must worship the Lord at both end of the day and in the evening. Know that good deeds cancel out the sins. This is a reminder for those who do not mind to be criticized.
Be patient and know that the Lord does not deprive the good people from their rewards.
What a shame that in the past there were not good people who would forbid the people of making mischief. If there were any, there were very few who were saved from [the punishment imposed upon] those nations. As for the wrong-doers, they were absorbed with their materialistic pre-occupations and ended up as criminals.
Your Lord is not such a One as to unjustly destroy any community while their citizens are righteous.
If God wanted, He would have made mankind one community; but (the wisdom of God necessitates that) people try different alternatives (and eventually arrive to the conclusion that only the Lord’s way is conducive to salvation.)
Only those who have [earned and] received the Lord’s Mercy will be saved. They are the ones created to (be examples for freedom of choice and to) fulfill the promise of the Lord that: “I will fill the Hell with human beings and Jinns (extra-terrestrials) alike.”
I tell you about the previous prophets to strengthen your belief. Here You have received the truth and enlightenments to be reminders for the believers.
Say to those who have chosen not to believe: “Feel free to do whatever you want to do and we will follow our way of life.”
Then add: “Then let us wait and see what will happen.”
To God belongs the secret of the heavens and the earth. Every thing is controlled by God. Therefore, obey Him and put your trust in Him. Rest assured that your Lord is never unaware of what you are doing.
A.L.R. These are the verses of a Book which presents its subject of discussion clearly to the public.
God has revealed this Book to you (Arab speaking people) in Arabic language (and not in an exotic language as you are demanding—as a miracle!) so that you understand it.
God, hereby, is going to reveal to you the best story ever told; and you knew nothing about it before its revelation.
Once [little] Joseph said to his father (Jacob, son of Isaac and grand son of Abraham): “I saw in my dream that eleven stars, the sun and the moon [the solar system as we know today] were prostrating themselves before me.
Jacob said: “My little (favorite) son, do not say anything about this dream to your brothers as they may [become jealous and] hurt you; indeed Satan [who is behind all evil plots] is the man’s worse enemy (and teaches him devilish things.)”
“[here is the meaning of your dream:] God has chosen (you as His Prophet and has decided) to teach you the knowledge of the interpretation of unknown. He will shower you, as well as the off springs of Jacob, with His blessings the same way that He favored your forefathers Abraham and Issac. Indeed God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise (and knows whom to choose and favor.)
This story of Joseph will answer many questions of those who are blessed with inquisitive minds.
This is how the story begins:] Joseph’s brothers (who were upset that their father spoils his two youngest sons the most) got together and said: “It seems that our father has lost his mind as he is favoring Joseph and his brother and does not pay any attention to us. This is not fair as we are united and stronger (which does not necessarily mean being better.)”
“Let us kill Joseph or somehow get rid of him; then our father will notice us. We will then [commit no more sin and] chose righteousness.
One of the brothers suggested: “Do not kill him. If you have to get rid of him, cast him in a remote well. When the caravans pass by, they may take him as a slave.”
They went to their father and said: “Why do you not trust us with Joseph? We [are his brothers after all and] do not wish nothing but the best for him.”
“Let him come with us tomorrow; we will feed him, let him play and take good care of him.”
Jacob said: “I am afraid that a wolf may attack him while you are busy with your work.”
They replied: “We will be good for nothing, if a wolf attacks him while he is among us.”
When they convinced the father, took him out and threw him in the well, I revealed to Joseph: “A time will come when you will reproach them for what they are doing. For the moment [they have admitted the Satan so deeply in themselves that] they do not realize what they are doing.”
Then the brothers returned to their fathers at nightfall and started to cry.
They said: “Father, we left Joseph alone with our belongings to race with each other; then the wolf took advantage of our absence and devoured him. You will never believe us in spite of the fact that we are telling you the truth.”
Then they presented the torn cloths of Joseph which they had stained with some kind of blood. Jacob said: “Your lost conscious has made it seem light for you what you have done to Joseph. All I can do is resort to patience. May God help me to bear the consequences of your wrongdoing.
Then a caravan passed by the well. When the person in charge of water supply threw his bucket in the well, he screamed joyfully and said: “How lucky! There is a boy here!” Then they took him along as a slave according to the pre-destined will of God.
Eventually they sold him for a cheap price as they did not have any need for him.
The person who bought him in Egypt [was so enchanted with him that he] said to his wife: “Take good care of him; he may prove himself to be worthy of being adopted as our son.” This was the way that I set the stage for Joseph to get established and taught him the knowledge of unknown. God is in control but most people do not realize it.
When Joseph became mature, I blessed him with wisdom and knowledge; this is the way that I reward the gracious ones.
One day, the lady of the house (who had gradually been fallen in love with Joseph) tried to seduce him. She locked the doors and said: “I am all yours.” Joseph replied: “I seek refuge in Lord; the One who has raised me in such a nice home. The Lord never let the unjust people (such as a person who has been treated nicely in a house and then develop a sinful relationship with the land lord’s wife) to succeed.”
She advanced towards him and he almost gave in. If it were not that he had received the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong from his Lord, he would have been seduced. This was a trial [giving him the opportunity] to remove the root of indecency from him. Joseph was indeed a true worshipper of Mine.
Putting himself together, Joseph ran towards the door, being chased by the lady of the house. She reached his shirt, pulled it and tore it from behind. Surprisingly, they came face to face with the master of the house. The Lady [in order to show her “innocence”] cried out: “How are you going to punish the one who wanted to molest your wife? imprisonment or torture?”
Joseph responded: “It was she who tried to seduce me.” At this one of the family members said: “If his shirt is torn from the front, she speaks the truth and Joseph lies.”
“ But if his shirt is torn from the back, the lady is a liar and Joseph says the truth.”
When the husband saw that the shirt was torn at the back, he said: “What a cunning woman.”
Then he continued: “Joseph, try to forget this incidence. As for you woman, you should beg forgiveness for your sin.”
The women of the town started to gossip about this incidence, saying: “The wife of the governor has passionately fallen in love with her slave; what kind of woman is she?”
When governor’s wife heard about such gossips, she invited all important ladies of the town and prepared a relaxed environment for them. When they were cutting the fruits with their knives, she asked Joseph to enter the room. they were so enchanted with his look that they cut their hands. They spontaneously said: “Good Lord; is he a human being or an angel?”
The governor’s wife said: “This is the man that you blame me of falling in love with. I have tried to seduce him, but so far he has refused me. If he continues to refuse me, I will send him to jail to be disgraced.”
Joseph said: “My Lord, I prefer imprisonment to what they are pushing me to. If You do not save me from their plot, I may fall into their trap and behave like any other ignorant person.”
His Lord, Who hears everything and is the Most Knowledgeable, granted his wish and made him immune to their seductive plans.
Eventually (out of vindication) they decided to cast him into the jail for a while.
Now with him there came into the jail two young men [that according to the Scripture were in charge of wine and baking needs of the king. they were cast into the jail as bugs were found in their products.]. One of them said: “I saw in my dream that I am pressing grapes into wine.” The other one said: “I had also a dream. I saw that I am carrying loaves of bread on my head. Then the birds came and started to eat the bread.” Then they turned to Joseph and said: “We have found you a graceful person; would you kindly interpret these dreams of ours?”
Joseph [took advantage of their interest in “dream interpretation” to carry on his mission as a Propheti.e., inviting people to the right path of God. He] said: “God has blessed me with the knowledge of unknown. For instance, I can tell you what you are going to eat today before that food is offered to you. I am not like those people who do not believe neither in God nor in Hereafter; such people are indeed disbelievers.
I follow the religion of my forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We do not believe that God has any partner. The knowledge of this truth is the blessing that God has showered us and people with it. What a shame that most people are not grateful being blessed with this knowledge.”
“Tell me my fellow prisoners, which belief is better: belief in many gods or relying upon One Supreme God?”
“The gods that you are worshipping simply do not exist. These are only the names that you and your forefathers have invented. God has not given any power to those invented names of yours. There is only One Ruler in the universe, and He has ruled that you shall not worship none but Him. This is the only true religion. What a shame that most people do not realize it.”
“As to the interpretation of your dreams (that the One and only One Lord has blessed me with its knowledge,) the one who has dreamt of pressing the wine will serve wine (to the king of Egypt) and the other one will be crucified and the birds will eat of his head.”
Then Joseph turned to the one whom he thought would be released and said: “When you are released, would you kindly mention my situation to the king? The Satan, however, made the man to forget everything (the same way that Satan makes people to forget good things that others have done for them and turns them into ungrateful people) and, consequently, Joseph stayed in the jail for a few more years (to learn that depending upon others than God, who are easily swayed by Satan, is fruitless and that only God can relieve the hardship that one faces with.)
One day the king said: “ I have seen in my dream that seven fat cows were eating seven skinny cows. I also saw seven green ears of corn and seven dry ears of corn! Can anyone among you, my advisors, interpret this dream of mine?”
They replied: “It sounds like a meaningless dream; but again, we do not know anything about the interpretation of the dreams.”
The one who was released from the prison (and served the king as a butler) said: “I will tell you its interpretation, if you let me visit Joseph in the prison.”
“Joseph! O man of truth.” (he said) “What is the interpretation of this dream of seven fat cows devouring seven skinny ones and the seven green ears of corn and seven dry ears of corn? Let me know so that I explain it to my people.”
Joseph replied: “Whatever you harvest, during the next seven years, consume a part of it and save the remainder.”
“After these seven years of affluence, you will face seven years of drought. Then it will be the time to consume what you have saved.”
“ Now after these seven years of hardship, you will have a year of abundance in which people will extract the juice of fruits and press the oil of olive one more time.”
The king said: “Bring this man to me.” When they were preparing Joseph for the royal audience, he said: “Ask the king to investigate the incidence in which the women of the town cut their hands (so that I go to him as an honest man and not a person who has betrayed his master’s trust.) God is aware of my enemies’ vicious plot [and will re-instate my reputation.]”
The king asked the women about the incidence. They all said: “God have mercy on us; we found not a bit of evil in Joseph. When it came to the woman who had accused him at first place, she said: “Now that the truth has sipped out, I confess that it was I who tried to seduce him. He is indeed a virtuous man.”
Joseph said: “The reason for which I asked for this enquiry is to prove once and forever to my ex-master that I did not take advantage of his trust; after all, God never guides those who betray the trust.”
“I do not claim to be a saint. The human being always leans towards indecencies; except those who (deserve the Lord’s Mercy and) God takes them under His umbrella of protection. Indeed my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.”
The king said: “Now let him come to my presence as I would like to hire (such a trustworthy person) him to work for me.” When Joseph arrived to the court, the king said: “I am going to offer you an honorable position as I trust you.”
Joseph said: “make me your treasurer as I am knowledgeable in this domain.”
Thus I established Joseph on earth, ruling as he wished. I shower whomever I decide with my blessing and I never let go waste the reward of those who are righteous.
Yet the reward of the Hereafter is much better (than the worldly reward) for those believers who choose righteousness.
Joseph’s brothers (like the other people who were caught by the draught) came to Joseph (asking for food for their tribe.) He recognized them but they did not.
Joseph gave them what they wanted and said: “Next time, bring your brother (that you claim you have) so that I see him (and be sure that you have not invented him to get more food.) Do you not see that I am a gracious host and just in distributing the food?”
“If you do not come with him, you better do not show your face as you will get nothing from me.”
They replied: “We will do our best to convince our father to send him with us.”
Joseph then ordered his servants to put their goods (which they had bartered for the food) secretly in their bags. He hoped that they will appreciate his generosity and return back.
When they reached home they said to their father: “Please send our baby brother with us as this is the only way to get the food. We will promise to take good care of him.”
Their father said: “Should I entrust him to you as I entrusted Joseph to you before? No way, I entrust him to God Who is the best Protector. He is the Most Merciful of all the merciful ones.”
When they opened their bags, they cried out of happiness: “See father; what more do we want. The man has even returned our merchandise. We have to go back and get more food for our family. We will take good care of our baby brother and obtain an extra camel-load of food (on his account.) What a great deal.”
Jacob said: “I will not send him with you, unless you swear by God that you will do everything humanly possible to bring him back to me.” When they gave him their solemn pledge, he said: “Never forget that the Lord is a witness to your pledge.”
Jacob then said: “When you arrive (to the capital of Egypt,) do not enter from the same gate (to attract attention.) Enter from different gates and know that (even though I am a prophet and the Lord may grant my wishes) I cannot save you from what is pre-determined by God. I put my trust in Him the same way that all those who have to make a decision should put their trust in Him.”
They followed the instructions of their father and entered to the city from different gates. Although this could not have changed anything that the Lord has decreed, Jacob had a personal reason for asking them to do so. He had been blessed by a certain type of knowledge from God. what a shame that most people do not understand these things.
When they entered Joseph’s place, he talked privately to his brother, introduced himself to him, and said: “Do not be upset with what your brothers have done.”
When Joseph provided them with their provision, he slid his cup inside his brother’s bag. Then one of his workers accused them of the theft.
Turning back, they asked: “What is lost?”
The royal servants said: “The royal cup is lost.” Then their supervisor said: “Whoever returns it, will get an extra camel-load of grain; I personally guarantee this.”
The brothers said: “You know very well, and we take God as our witness, that we have not come here to do mischief and that we are not thieves.”
The servants asked: “Tell us, what shall be your punishment, if you are proven to be guilty?”
The brothers replied: “If the cup is found in anybody’s bag, he would be yours as a slave. This is the way that we punish the thief.”
Joseph then started to search his (step) brothers’ loads first, before searching his brother’s bag. Then he took the cup out from the pack of his brother (Benjamin.) This is how I helped Joseph to complete his plan in order to be able to keep his brother with him. He could not have kept his brother, if he had applied the law of the land. Yes; it was the will of God. I rais whoever I will to a higher rank; and above every knowledgeable person, there is One All-Knowledgeable Who is above all knowledgeable ones.
The other brothers (in order to disassociate themselves from Benjamin) said: “Of course; he is a thief like his brother Joseph!” Joseph [in order not to reveal his identity] said to himself: “What evil people you are. Good thing God knows the truth.”
The brothers said: “Your highness, he has a very old father (which may have a heart attack or something, hearing his baby is enslaved.) You are a kind man; take one of us in his place.”
Joseph replied: “God forbid. It will be injustice to punish any one other than the thief.”
Disappointed, they went to a corner to talk about the incidence. The elder one said: “Your father has taken a solemn pledge from you at the presence of God. You also know that what you did to Joseph was wrong. I am not going to leave this place without my father’s permission or the Lord’s judgment in my favor; I bear witness that the Lord is the best Judge.”
Go back to your father and explain how his son was caught red hand. Let him know that we guarded him against what we were able to see and that we could not have protected him against [the Satan’s temptation, his hidden theft, etc. which was happening in] the world of unseen.
Ask your father to question those who witnessed the whole thing and returned with your caravan.
Hearing their story, Jacob said: “How lightly you accept the things at their face value. Well, I have to bear this with a graceful patience. May the Lord, Who knows everything and is the Most Wise, bring back my lost ones to me.”
Jacob then turned away from them saying: “Now let me mourn for my Joseph.” His eyes turned white from grieving so much and he went into a deep depression.
Jacob’s sons said: “For God’s sake; If you keep on mourning for Joseph, you will become sick and you may even die of grief.”
Jacob replied: “I simply pray to God about my sorrow and grief. You do not know as much as I know about the Lord.”
“Listen my children; go look for Joseph and Benjamin and do not give up on God’s grace. Only the disbelievers give up on God’s mercy.”
When they returned back to the presence of Joseph’s, they said: “Your highness, we and our family are going through a lot of hardship now. We have brought some merchandise of less value to barter for food. Please be charitable and give us enough food for our survival in return. You know well that God highly rewards the charitable people.”
In reply he said: “Do you recall what you did to Joseph and his brother at the climax of your ignorance?”
They were so taken by surprise that they cried: “You must be Joseph.” He said: “Yes; I am Joseph, and here is my brother (and not my slave as you think.) God has been good to us. He never fails to reward those who lead a righteous life and recourse to patience.
They said: “We were wrong and [among other things that is why] God has made you superior to us.”
Joseph replied: “Do not blame yourself. May God forgive you. Of all those who are merciful, God is the Most Merciful.”
“No go back and put this shirt of mine over my father’s eyes; this will restore his vision. Then take all your families and come back to me.
When their caravan left Egypt, their father said to his folk: “I can sense the smell of Joseph; do not call me names (such as senile, crazy, etc.)”
His folk replied: “You are still living in the past!”
When the sons arrived and put the shirt of Joseph on his eyes, he got his eye sight back and said: “Did I not tell you that I was blessed with the revelations from the Lord that you were unaware of ?”
His sons said: “Father, please pray to God to forgive us. We were absolutely wrong.”
Jacob said: “I will beg my Lord to forgive you. He is the Forgiver, Most Merciful.
When they arrived to Egypt and met Joseph, he embraced his parents and said: “Welcome to Egypt. God willing, you will be safe here.”
Joseph placed his parents at the highest seat and then they all fell prostrate before him. He said: “Father, do you remember my dream. My Lord has made it come true. God has been good to me. He took me out of prison and brought you all to me from the heart of the desert and made Satan to fail in his plot to create animosity between me and my brothers. My Lord is Most Kind unto Whom He wills (and deserves.) He knows everything and He is the Most Wise.”
“My Lord, You have given me the power and You have taught me the interpretation of dreams. Originator of the heavens and the earth! I bear witness that you are my Lord in this world as well as in the Hereafter. When my time comes, please let me die as a Muslim (in Arabic meaning “submitter to the Lord.”) and join me with the righteous servants of yours.”
You (Mohammad) are thus being informed about this story which took place in the past (and its detailed are kept as unknown to the people.) After all, you were not there when they conspired against Joseph (to throw him in the well.)
What a shame that most people, no matter what you do, will choose not to believe.
You charge people nothing for delivering this message, which is a reminder for the intelligent residents of the whole universe.
As a matter of fact there are so many signs in the heavens and the earth (which testifies for the existence, greatness, and oneness of the Lord.) Yet, they pass by and do not show any interest in it.
As to those who believe in God, most of them believe in other (man-invented) gods (Christians believe that Jesus in God and most people fall so much in love with their women, wealth employer, etc. that they raise them to the heaven and start to worship them!)
Do they not realize that the Lord may subject them to a sever punishment? Do they not mind of the Day of Judgment which may catch up with them all of a sudden?
Say: “This is my path. I invite you to God. My followers and I see the path fully lit. Glorious (Perfect) is the Lord and (I seek refuge in Him as) I do not associate none with Him.
All the Prophets that I sent before you, were also human beings (chosen from their own communities) to relay My revelations. Do these people ever travel to see what happened to people who passed away before them? Know that the life after death is much better for those who lead a righteous life. Do you get it?
The previous Prophets went on spreading My Words for the longest time till they became disappointed. When they were treated as liar, My help reached them; I saved whoever I had decided and the punishment of the guilty people was unavoidable.
There are many lessons in their stories to be learnt by those people who use their brain. This is not a fabricated story. Qur’an confirms all previous Scriptures, gives details of everything (which is required for the success of man), is a guidance, and a mercy for those who have chosen to believe.
A.L.M.R These are the verses of Qur’an revealing nothing but the truth revealed to you (Mohammad.) What a shame that most people do not believe in it.
God is the One Who created the universe that you see with your own eyes without any supporting pillar . Then He assumed the control over the universe. He has subjected the sun and the moon to the motions in theirs orbits until they face their destiny. He is in charge of all happenings in the universe. I am telling you all these so that you contemplate and come to the conclusion that [the word of your Lord is the truth and that] you will certainly meet your Lord.
God is the One Who spread out the earth and placed on it mountains and rivers. Then He introduced male and female species. He is the One Who rolls the nights over the days and all these phenomena are subject of contemplation for those who bother to think.
On earth you see neighboring lots of land. In them you will see orchards of grapes, corn fields, and palm trees (sharing the same root or depending on different roots.) Although they are irrigated with the same water, yet they differ in taste as planned by your Lord. These, too, are mind bugling subject of contemplation for those who are blessed with the faculty of thought.
If there is anything for you to wonder at, it should be their (mockingly) saying: “What! After we turn into dust, shall we then be raised to live again?” These are the people who have chosen to deny their Lord. The only thing that they have earned is a chain around their necks to be imprisoned in the Hell forever.
They are such idiots that ask you to advance their punishment (as a proof of your prophet hood) rather than asking you about righteousness. There has been more than enough instances of the Lord’s punishment in the past to serve them as an example. The fact of the matter is that your Lord bears with the sinners (for a while) and (then) He is the most sever in imposing His punishment.
The disbelievers say: “If he had presented a miracle, we would have believed in him.” Your mission is to warn the people (not to impress them with the miracles. Besides, did the previous people submitted to the truth after having been exposed to so many undeniable miracles?) Every nation had a guiding teacher like you.
God knows what every female bears in her womb. He is fully aware of the state of the evolution of the embryo inside the womb. as a matter of fact, everything in His realm of creation is precisely calculated.
The Lord has absolute knowledge over what you see and what you do not see. He is the Great, the Most Supreme.
It does not matter to Him whether you hide your thoughts, declare them, hide yourself in the darkness or show yourself in the daylight. You are constantly under His supervision.
For each person, there are appointed angels who guard him from the front and the behind by the order of God. Know that God will not (order these angels to) change the condition of any people unless they, themselves, take the appropriate steps towards the change. Noël, if the Lord (for some reason) decides to impose a hardship for (a person or) a people, none can stop it as there is no lord beside the Lord.
He is the One Who orders the lightening to strike right before your own eyes. Although you are frightened, you wish for it (for the rain that follows it.) He is the One Who raises the clouds saturated with water.
The thunder glorifies Him (and manifests the power of the Lord who has created it.) The angles also glorify Him out of awe (at His greatness.) He strikes with the lightning bolts whoever He wills; yet, they (the ignorant people who cannot even see the manifestation of His power in the thunder) argue about God, though His power is awesome.
The only one who should be begged (and worshipped) is the Lord. The idols that the disbelievers implore cannot ever respond. Asking for help from someone beside God is like stretching the hands towards water and asking it to come to the mouth! The prayers of the disbelievers, therefore, is in vain.
To God submit whatever is in existence in the heavens and the earth. They do so willingly or unwillingly (A disbeliever’s heart, e.g., has to submit itself to what God has ordered it to do and its owner cannot change it to his will.) Have you not seen that the shadow of all things bow down (willingly or unwillingly) before the Lord in the morning and the evening?
Ask: “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” [When you see their hesitance in answering,] say: “God.” Then say: “Knowing this fact, why do you then adopt less than God as your lord? Do you not see that these adopted lords of yours have no power whatsoever to do something?” Say: “Is a blind man (physically speaking) equal to the one who can see?” Say: “Is darkness the same as the light?” Have your adopted gods created the things so similar to the creation of the Lord that [has made it difficult for you to distinguish God from your idols as easily as you distinguish darkness from the light or blind from the man who sees, and that] it has become so difficult for you to judge who is God and who is not God? Say: “God is the Creator of everything; He is One and He is Almighty.
God is the One Who pours down water from the sky causing the valleys to overflow. The river then produces lots of foam as the water runs fast. The metals, melted to make ornaments or utensils, too, produces lots of scum. By these examples the Lord wants to explain how the truth (like the water or the melted metal) which is useful for the people stays and how the falsehood (the foam or the scum which is good for nothing) disappears.
Those who respond to their Lord, they will receive an excellent reward from Him. As for those who disregard the Lord, they will end up in the Hell what a miserable destiny. They will readily pay anything in order not to be sent there. However, even if they own and offer the entire treasures of the earth (or even twice as much,) it will not be accepted from them.
The true believers are the one who has accepted that this Book (which is sent down to you) is a revelation of the Lord equal to the one who is blind to this fact? Only the intelligent people will listen to the admonition.
Such intelligent people will fulfill their obligation to the Lord and will not break their promises.
They will respect the Lord’s commandments in its entirety, respect the Lord with an utmost respect, and will be fearful of wrongdoing.
They will recourse to the patience (to achieve a “God loving way of life”), worship their Lord on regular basis, devote a part of their “God given” income to the charity (publicly or secretly), and their response to evil will be goodness. Such people deserve the best in the Hereafter.
They will enter into the gardens of Paradise, together with their forefathers, spouses, and their descendents (if the latter have been righteous also) and will be welcomed by the angels at any gate.
They will be greeted by peaceful wishes; a reward for their patience which led them to such a wonderful place.
As for those who betrayed their Lord by breaking their promises, disregarding the commandments of the Lord, and spreading the corruption on the earth, they will face their Lord’s disenchantment and end up in a terrible place.
Those who are enchanted with the life of this world should know that it is nothing compared to the Hereafter; [therefore, it really does not matter if] God (for the reasons that is mentioned in this Book) gives more (to whoever He decides) and less (to whoever He wills.)
The disbelievers (make a joke and) say: “How come God has not blessed this Prophet with a miracle?” Say: “God will lead to the loss whoever He wills (for the simple token that no miracle in the past has proven to change an obdurate mind) and He guides whoever (who is willing to listen to this message which by itself is the greatest miracle and) who submits (to the messages contained in this Book.)
Those who are guided are the ones who become more convinced when the name of God is mentioned. Yes; it is the Lord’s remembrance (in daily acts of worshipping) which brings comfort to hearts.
Those who are guided are the ones who believe and do good deeds. The are showered with My blessings and will end up in a wonderful place.
I have sent you in this manner (without any jazzy miracle) to be My Messenger for a nation who has seen so many civilization come and go. Your mission is to relay the Message. What a shame that they choose to disbelieve in the Most Gracious. Say: “He is My Lord. There is no God beside Him; to Him alone is my only resort.”
The disbelievers (who ask for a miracle) would not have believed, even if this Qur’an had made the mountains to move, the earth to open up or the dead to speak (as it happened in the case of the previous prophets.) God is in control of everything. It is too soon for the believer to be disappointed (that an undeniable miracle is not being sent.) If God wills, He can guide all the people (which, by the way, happened in their own life time when after the fall of Mecca, disbelievers embraced Islam by groups.) The disbelievers will continuously suffer directly (as it happened battle after battle) or indirectly in account of their own mischief. The Lord’s promise will be fulfilled; He never fails to deliver.
The prophets before you also were subject to the disbelievers’ mockery. I put up with them for a while and then subjected them to my punishment; how awful was my punishment.
They set up equals to the Lord, while He is the Only One Who is in control of every single soul. Ask them to name their adopted lords; then say: “Are you informing the Lord of something on earth that He does not know about? Is it not true that these gods of your are simply fabricated by you and that what you are saying are simply phrases void of meaning?” Their passionate defense of their religion has made the falsehood so appealing in their eyes that they are diverted from the right path. The fact of the matter is, no one can guide the one that God sends to the wrong path.
They will receive a punishment in this world (and a more horrible punishment in the Hereafter) and they will find none to protect them from the Lord.
The heaven (which is promised for the righteous people) may be imagined as a garden in which the water flows beneath the trees, with unlimited food (served forever), and the cool shades (to be enjoyed.) As for the disbelievers, nothing but the Fire is in reserve for them.
Those who have grasped the Scripture, welcome this Book which is revealed to you. Different sects among them, however, rejects part of it. Say to them: “I am ordered to worship God and associate none with Him. I invite you to Him and to Him I give myself up.”
I have revealed My Commandments in Arabic (in order to be understood.) Now if you give up to their desires (and compromise) after having learnt the truth, know that there is none to defend you nor to protect you against the Lord.
I have sent many Messengers before you and (in spite of those who think that the Prophets had to do nothing with the carnal desire) they were married and had children (it is therefore possible that, as some Christians believe, Christ was married and had children.) No Prophet can come up with a miracle without the Lord’s permission as predetermined by God (for a specific purpose and occasion.)
The original source of all Divine Books (referred to as Mother of the Books) is at the disposition of the Lord. He erases (from the previously revealed Books) whatever he decides (in accordance with a planned strategy by Him) and keeps intact whatever He wills.
Rest assured that my treats will be fulfilled. You may see a part of it or your life may not be long enough to see it. In any case, your only mission is to deliver the message. It is My business to call them to account.
Do they not see how day by day they are loosing the ground. It is God Who rules and there is none to reverse His decrees and God is swift in taking the guilty ones to account.
Others before them tried to challenge the Lord, but it is God Who has the ultimate hand. He knows what every soul has earned and the disbelievers pretty soon will realize who the real winners are.
The disbelievers say: “You are a false Prophet.” Respond: “I have two witness for my prophet hood: God and those who have grasped the Scripture.”
A.L.R. Qur’an is a book revealed from God to Mohammad in order to lead mankind, by His will, out of darkness into light: The path of God Almighty, the only One Worthy of Worship.
God is the owner of everything which exist in the heavens and in the earth. How terrible is God’s punishment being reserved for the disbelievers
Those who prefer this worldly life to Life after death, prefer dirt roads which lead to nowhere to God’s highway. They are indeed wrong.
For those who ask why Qur’an is not revealed in another language as a miracle!] God has always sent His words to each nation on their own language so that they may get the message clearly. [The message thus being clear], God then makes whoever he pleases [of the disbelievers] to walk on the wrong path and whoever he pleases to join the right path and He is the All Mighty, the Wisest.
I (God) sent Moses with [undeniable] miracles and said: “Lead your people out of darkness into the light and remind them of what they have to do (how to worship God) in each day of the Lord (as well as the history of mankind.) Those who are patient and grateful will understand it (wisdom of their daily acts of worship.)”
Moses said to his people: “Count your blessings. The Lord saved you from the tyranny of the Pharaoh’s people. They had made your life miserable: Slaughtering your males and abusing your females. What a harsh trial your Lord had subjected you to.”
Remember what your Lord has promised: “The more appreciative you are, the more I will shower you with my blessings. On the contrary, if you do not appreciate my blessings upon you, I will subject you to the sever punishments (for a complete sermon of Moses (as mentioned in the Bible) see Deuteronomy Ch.4-6-8-10-11-28-29-30.)”
Moses also said: “If you choose to disregard the Lord (along with all people on earth), God cares the least as He is in no need. He is The Wealthiest, the Only One worth of praise.”
Have you not heard about the previous nations (such as the people of Noah, Aad, Thamood, and the others who followed them?) There were also other nations (such as Mayas, Incas, etc.) that only God knows their full history. All those nations were blessed with Prophets who had undeniable miracles in support of their prophet hood. But when they conveyed the Message, people put their fingers in their mouth (the utmost sign of disrespect, as though they were vomiting) and said: “We disbelieve in your miracles and doubt about the way of life that you are inviting us to.”
Their prophets said: “Do you have doubt about the Lord who has initiated the heavens and the earth? What is wrong about His willingness to forgive your sins and giving you a second chance from now till the rest of your life [so that you prove that you deserve His generosity?” The disbelievers replied: “Who are you? You are nothing but human beings like us. You simply want to change our way of life (as it is fashionable today to refer to as American way of life in the U.S.) and deprive us of what our forefathers have worshipped in their wisdom. If you are truthful, come up with a miracle in support of your claims.”
Their prophets replied: “True, we are human beings like you. Do you have any objection if the Lord blesses someone among you and appoint him as His Messenger for you? As for your demand for a miracle, we cannot produce none without the will of the Lord. Know that in God alone the believers put their trust.”
They continued: “Is there any reason that we should not trust the One Who has guided us to the straight path? We will patiently continue put up with your persecution. Those who are blessed with the ability to trust, trust none but the Lord.”
The disbelievers replied: “Enough is enough; if you do not join us, we will kick you our of our state.” The Lord then revealed to them: “It is time to destroy the disbelievers.”
“Then, I will establish you in their land as a reward for respecting Me and believing in My promise.”
They challenged the Lord and received what they deserved. Every tyrant has to face his doom.
Waiting for such person is Hell, wherein he has nothing to drink but a boiling disgusting water.
He can not bear more than a sip. He will face the agony of the death which will approach him from every direction, yet he will not be terminated. He has to continue suffering.
The disbelievers’ good deeds will not benefit them (as it is the truth that has to remain and the falsehood, with all its beneficial side effect has to vanish.) Their works will disappear the same way that the ashes disappear by a strong wind in a stormy day. Such is the case of one who goes far from the boundaries set by God.
Do you not see that God has based the creation of the heavens and the earth on the basis of (the survival of the) truth? If He (faces the human being’s continuous effort to establish the falsehood then He) may decide to remove man and substitute him with a new creation.
This is not difficult at all for God.
When the disbelievers stand before God, they will ask their leaders: “We used to follow you. Can you help us now to receive a little bit lighter sentence from God?” Their leader will say: “If we had deserved the Lord’s guidance in our worldly life, we would have guided you (so that you receive a lighter sentence, or none, today.) Now it is too late. Whether we face our destiny with patience or grief, there is no escape for us.
Once the judgment is passed, Satan will say: “God kept His promises. I broke my promises to you. I never had any power over you. I invited you to my path and you simply accepted it. Therefore, do not blame me; blame yourselves. Today, neither I can help you nor you can get me out of trouble. You chose me as your Lord by obeying me [instead of obeying God.] I disown you for adopting other than God as your lords. The unjust people (such as yours who committed such a big injustice) have to taste an awful punishment.
As for those who chose to believe (and what they did in their life was God pleasing,) they will enter into the gardens of Paradise under which the canals of water flow. They will have the permission of the Lord to stay there forever and will be greeted with : “Peace!”
God considers the “Pure Word” (the belief in oneness of God, God pleasing acts, regulars worshipping acts, charity, belief in Hereafter, etc.) as a “pure tree” which is deeply rooted on earth (in the heart of the believers) and its branches high in the sky (striving to reach the Heaven.)
Such three has permission form the Lord to bear fruits every season (from which the spirits of the believers feed.) Thus, God makes His points clear so that people come to their senses.
As to the “Evil Word” (opposite of the Pure word), it is like a tree that has no root (essence) to stand upon. It is chopped at the soil level.
God strengthens those who believe with His “Firm word” in this life as well as in the Hereafter. As to the unjust people, God will send them to the darkness (as they have proven that they do not deserve the guidance) and God does whatever He wills.
Have you noted those who responded to the Lord’s blessings with ingratitude and led (themselves as well as) their people (family/ followers) to where the losers end up in?
Yes; they will end up in the Hell. What an evil place to end up in.
They fabricate their own ideologies setting up equals to God. Say to them: “Enjoy this short life of yours as you are headed towards the Hell.”
Say to those servants of mine who have chosen to believe: “Worship the Lord on regular basis, spend a part of your income (that God has given you at first place) to the charity (publicly or secretly) before the coming of a Day in which there will be neither bargaining nor any friendly gestures.
God is the One Who has created the heavens and the earth. He sends down the water from the sky in order to grow all kinds of agricultural products for you to eat. He has let you take control of the ships by which He may let you travel overseas and has put the rivers as well subservient to you.
God is the One Who has made the sun and the moon (which constantly follow their paths) of service to you. He has also subjected the night and the day to [the laws which are beneficial to] you.
God has given you what you have asked for. As a matter of fact, you are showered with so much blessings that you cannot even count them! What a shame that mankind is unjust and ungrateful.
Now (I open a new chapter and ask you to) remember when Abraham said: “My Lord, please make this place (Mecca) a city of peace and save me and my descendents from falling into idol worshipping trap.”
“Lord, idol worshipping has led many people to darkness. Those who follow me, they belong with me. As for those who do not follow me, (lead them to the right path as) you are forgiver and Most Merciful.”
“Lord, I have settled some of my off springs in an uncultivatable valley near your sacred House. Lord, I have given them this opportunity so that they may worship you properly. May you make the people’s hearts tender towards them. May you provide for them all kind of agricultural products and may they turn out grateful to your blessings.”
“Our Lord, you are aware of what we are keeping as secret to ourselves as well as what we declare publicly. The fact of the matter is, nothing in the earth and in the heaven is hidden from God.”
“I thank you God for granting me Ishmael and Isaac, at such an old age. I bear witness that My Lord answers the prayers.”
“Lord, bless me and my off springs with the urge to worship you on regular basis. Lord, may you respond to my prayers.”
“Lord, forgive me, my parents, as well as all the believers on the Day that we have to present our report card to you.”
Do not ever think that God is unaware of what the disbelievers do. He only leaves them alone for a while until the Day that the eyes will become wide open out of terror.
They will rush (to the appointed place) in terror with their heads up-lifted. Their eyes will not even blink and they will be absolutely horrified.
Let them know that there will be a Day when they have to face their punishment. Those who have been unjust will beg: “Our Lord, give just a little more time so that we respond to your Message and follow your Messengers.” They will be responded: “Are you not the same people who used to swear that there is no such thing as punishment?”
Remember that you live in the same land that its people wronged their souls. You know exactly how I punished them. Learn from such examples.
The disbelievers had recourse to the most evil plans; the plans that could have moved the mountains. What they did not know was that God was aware of their plans.
Do not think even for a moment that God will ever break what He has promised to His messengers. The Lord is Almighty & Revengeful.
One Day (when the earth will be a totally different earth and the heavens will look strange,) everyone will be brought before the Lord, the One, the Irresistible.
Then you will see all sinners chained together.
They will be dipped in tar and their faces covered with fire.
Thus God will pay each soul what it has earned. Yes; God is swift in implementing His Justice.
This (Qur’an) is a universal Message for mankind. Let them all know that He is the One and Only One God. May those who are blessed with intelligence come to their senses and take this warning seriously.
A.L.R. These are indeed the signs indicated in the Book and a part of “easy to understand” Qur’an.
Pretty soon the same people who violently oppose Islam will submit themselves to the will of God regretting why they did not embrace Islam sooner.
Leave them on their own to be preoccupied with their daily affairs of eating, drinking, entertaining themselves and follow their worldly desires which will eventually make them sorry.
Every town which God destroyed, was given a prescribed time for re-thinking and repentance (as a sign of God’s mercy.)
No community is destroyed before its pre-determined time of reflection and re-evaluation nor is given more time than what is fair enough for coming to their senses.
The disbelievers make mockery saying: “This Mohammad guy who claims to receive divine revelation is nothing but a crazy person.”
They say: “Why God has not sent us His Angles to testify for the truthfulness of Mohammad’s mission?”
I (God) do not send the Angles for the entertainment of people. When I send my Angles down to establish My Will, there will be no time for you silly people to repent.
I have sent down this Qur’an and I will protect it [what a guarantee more than the promise of Lord All Mighty Himself as a tamper proof ness of Qur’an].
O’ Mohammad,
we have sent many prophets before you to their own people in the past and they all were laughed at.
With their words, these prophets tried to touch their minds.
However, they did not believe their prophet; being stubborn is the state of mind and a characteristic of the disbelievers
Even if I (God) open a gate from the heaven for them in the middle of the day so that they may climb over and see with their own eyes whatever is behind the curtain, they will not believe in what they see!
They will say: “We are being hypnotized or something and whatever we see is just an illusion.”
I am the One Who has set out the zodiac signs in the heaves that has made some so enchanted.
Such places are far beyond the reach of the devils (indicating that Satan and his followers do not have the power to roam freely in the universe.)
If they sneaks around to listen (to the heart beat of the stars as captured by radio telescopes,) a fiery flame will interrupt their trial.
As for the earth, I have spread it out, established firm mountains in it and have provided a balanced environment hospitable to the growth of all kind of suitable things.
On earth, I have provided your necessities (food, water, air) as well as whatever the other creatures (that you do not take care of them) need to continue their lives.
I own everything (that you know of) in infinite amounts (in the universe.) Yet, you will find them proportionately spread on earth (forming a well- balanced eco-system.)
I am the One Who sends the wind to fertilize the land [and to pollinate the vegetations.) I send down your drinking water from the sky. It is not you who store it up.
I am the One Who gives life and death. I am the One Who, at the end, inherits all (as all living species die and He alone remains; therefore, He is the only inheritor.)
I am fully aware of those who advance and those who lag behind.
Rest assured that your Lord one day will summon them all. He is the Most Wise, the Most Knowledgeable.
I created man from an aged mud (like the one used in the pottery.)
As for the jinns, I created them before creating human being, from a blazing fire looking substance
I said to the angles: “I am going to create a human being from dried clay of rotten earth.”
“When I shaped him and breathed into him of My spirit, you must fall prostrate before him.”
All the angles fell prostrate.
Only Satan refused to join them in prostration.
I asked: “Satan, what prevented you to join them in prostration?”
He said: “I am not going to prostrate before a being whom You have created from rotten earth.”
I said: “Get out of here; you are now an outcast.”
“You will carry My disenchantment until the Day of Judgment.”
Satan asked: “My Lord! Will you leave me alone until the Day that they all are raised to a new life.?”
I said: “Your request is granted.”
“Until that Day which is pre-determined.”
He said: “My Lord, as you have excluded me from salvation, I will enchant them with their earthly life so much that they are misled into the wrong path.”
“The only ones that I will fail are your sincere worshippers.”
The Lord confirmed: “This (sincere devotion and worship) is indeed the way that leads straight to me.”
“You have no power over My sincere worshippers. You will succeed tempting only those who choose to follow you.”
“Your followers, then, will be gathered in the Hell.”
“The Hell has seven gates; each welcoming a certain type of sinners.”
As for the righteous people, they will end up in beautiful gardens full of springs.
They will enter therein, peacefully and secure.
I will erase all bad feelings [that they might have developed in their worldly life towards each other] from their memory. Thus, they will become like brothers, enjoying themselves while sitting face to face in reclining plush furniture.
They will never feel any sickness nor will they be evicted from Paradise.
O’ Prophet! let My servants know that I am Forgiver and the Most Merciful.
Also let them know that My punishment is the most painful.
Now inform the about Abraham’s guests.
When they arrived, they said: “Peace be with you.” He said, “You frighten me.”
They replied: “Do not be afraid. We have brought you a good news: You will be blessed with a wise son.”
Abraham said: “What! How can you give an old man like me a good news like this? Are you sure?”
They said: “This good news is nothing but the truth. You should not act like those who have given up.”
Abraham confirmed: “Only those who do not believe in God will give up.”
He continued: “What is your mission.”
They said: “We are sent to punish a guilty nation (Sodom and Gommhora.)”
“We will save Lot’s family.”
“Except his wife. God has decided to leave her with the doomed ones.”
Then the executioners went to Lot’s town (Sodom & Gommhora.)
Lot welcomed them and said: “You look stranger to me.”
They replied: “Not really; we are here to deliver the punishment that the disbelievers always were making fun of.”
“We are truthful ones armed with the truth!”
“Depart with your people in the last hours of the night. Stay behind them and ask them not to look back. Go straight where you are commanded to go.”
Thus I informed Lot about My decision concerning the next day destruction of those people .
Meanwhile the people of the town rushed joyfully to the house of Lot (to have fun with his guests.)
He said: “These are my guests; do not embarrass me.”
“Fear God and do not put me to shame.”
They said: “We have already told you not to talk about morality with us?”
He said: “Take my daughters instead, if you must.”
Alas they were drunk and out of their mind.
So they were subjected to a sever blast early in the morning.
I turned their houses upside down and rained upon them heated stones.
Those who are intelligent will learn a lesson from their story.
Their ruins are still there;
so that the believers refer to it as a lesson.
The people of “Thick Forest” (blessed with Prophet Shu’aib, they called themselves Midianites after they capital city and referred to as Tabuk these days) were also indulged in sins.
They too were subjected to my punishment. Their ruins are also available for sightseeing.
The People of Al-Hijr (located at north-west of Madina) also rejected their Prophets.
I sent them thus My revelations, but they preferred to disregard them.
They used to carve secure houses inside the mountains.
Then a rumbling overtook them in the morning (that made their secure houses of no protection to them.)
Whatever they had gained was of no help to them.
I have created the heavens, the earth, and whatever is between not for fun. Know that the end of the world will come. Therefore, graciously forgive their ignorance (and continue spreading the word.)
Know that your Lord is the Creator, the Most Knowledgeable.
I have given you seven verses (most probably the seven verses which opens Qur’an) and this Glorious Qur’an.
Do not wonder why they (disbelievers) are blessed with the worldly wealth nor become sad for their (deplorable mental) condition. Just pay your attention to the believers.
And say: “I am only a plain Warner.”
This warning is like the one that I sent [in the past] to those who divided their religion into different sects.
The disbelievers accept the Qur’an only partially (like the Jews who are criticized in Ch. for having accepted a part of their book and not believing in the rest.)
By your Lord, I will question them all about
(and hold responsible for) what they were doing.
So; carry out what you are ordered to do and disregard those who worship more than One God.
Never mind if they subject you to the mockeries.
Those who set up other gods beside God, will surely find out the truth (one way or the other.)
I know well how much you suffer by what they say.
Glorify your Lord (as a mean of lifting your moral,) be thankful to Him and Prostrate yourself in worship [the same way that Jesus (see Matthew 19-and other prophets (see Joshua 5:& 7:6 and Genesis 17:were worshipping the Lord.]
Keep on worshipping your Lord, until you reach the absolute belief.
Pretty soon you will find it is time to meet your Lord. Why are you in hurry to face your punishment [by jokingly asking Mohammad: “ why God does not send us his punishment ?”] Lord, the Glorious One, is above what disbeliever think to have a partner in His realm of creation.
God sends His angels down to reveal His message to any human being that He chooses to proclaim that: “There is no other Deity but God; be at awe with your God.”
God is the One Who has created the heavens and the earth to serve a purpose. He is too Perfect to have a partner.
He has created mankind from a tiny embryo; how funny of this insignificant creature to turn against his own soul and challenge his Creator.
God is the One Who has created for you the cattle so that you eat their meat, wear their skin and take advantage of so many other benefit they offer you.
How pleasant it is for you to bring them back to the stable at night and take them to the pastures next day.
They carry your loads to the most difficult to reach places that otherwise you had to carry with the most pain. How kind and merciful of your Lord to have created them for you.
God has created horses, mules and donkeys so that you ride them and use for your entertainment. God (besides the creatures that you know) has also created the creatures that you do not know about them [microscopic species, extraterrestrials, etc.]
There are many alternative ways. God wants to show you the right path. If He willed, He would have forced you to the right path (but He wants us to exercise our freedom of choice.)
He is the One Who sends down from the sky drinking water for you and by it grows vegetation for you and for your cattle.
Thus He grows for you crops, olives, date palms, grapes and all kinds of fruits. Those who use their brain for thinking and contemplate will find in it sufficient proof (for the existence, mercy and the greatness of God.)
God has put in your service the night and the day as well as the sun and the moon. The whole universe submits itself to His will. Here again, those who contemplate will find sufficient proofs.
There are many lessons to be learned from so many colorful things that God has put on the earth.
He is the One Who has put the sea in your disposition. You eat from it tender meat, find in it jewelry to wear and sail over it your ships. May you enjoy His blessings and be grateful to Him.
He has placed firm standing mountains on the earth to turn with you (everything on earth joins its turning around itself and round the sun as well as moving towards an unknown destiny.) See also the roads and the rivers that He has created and you use them to find your destination.
You also use the landmarks and the stars that He has created to find your way.
Is then He Who creates equal to the one that creates nothing (like your boss, your loved ones, your wealth, Jesus, the saints that you have created, the idols that you have carved, etc. that you worship beside God?)
Know that, your blessings are so many that you cannot count them! How Forgiving and Merciful is the Lord.
Know that God knows what you declare and what you keep as a secret.
Know that the idols (carved from the stone or wood) that some worship, do not create nothing. On the contrary, they themselves are created!
Such idols are dead. They do not have any spirit. They have no idea when they will be resurrected.
Know that your God is One God. It is in account of their arrogant that some People have chosen not to believe in the Hereafter.
God definitely knows what the disbelievers say and what they hide in their hearts. God does not love the arrogant people.
when the disbelievers are asked what they are thinking about the Lord’s Revelations, they simply say: “These are nothing but good old mythologies!”
On the Day of Resurrection, they will be crushed by the weight of their own sins. Additionally, they have to carry the sins of those whom they misled in account of their ignorance. What a miserable load to carry.
Others like them tried to plan evil things in the past. God responded by destroying the edifice of their evil plans at the foundation, causing the roof to fall on them. They did not even realized how they were struck.
God, on the Day of Resurrection will disgrace them and ask: “Where are those partners of Mine that you had invented for Me?” Those who were blessed with knowledge will say: “This is the Day that shame and misery will catch up with the disbelievers.”
These are the same people who will be put to death by the angels at the height of wrongdoing. They will have nothing to say in their defense except: “We did not do anything wrong!” No way! God knows exactly what you have done.
“Enter the gates of Hell and live there forever.” What a miserable place the arrogant ones have to end in.
As for those who respect the Lord, when their opinions are asked about the Lord’s Revelations, they will reply: “Indeed the best.” The pious ones will have the best (peace & contentment) in this life and a wonderful place to live in the Hereafter. What a blessed place reserved for the righteous people.
God rewards the righteous people by lodging them in the gardens of Eden under which the rivers flow and let all their wishes come true.
These are the people whose souls have been taken away when they were pure. The angels will say: “Peace with you, enter Paradise as a reward for your good deeds.”
What are the disbelievers waiting for? For the angels to appear to them or the Lord’s judgment against them? The disbelievers before them behaved exactly like them. God did not do any injustice to them; they were the ones who were unjust to themselves.
It was their own wrongdoings which caught up with them and the very things they were mocking at came back to haunt them.
The idol worshippers say: “If God wanted, neither we nor our forefathers would have never worshipped anything but the Lord. Nor would we have declared anything that God has made lawful as unlawful.” Such excuses were also presented by the people who were living before them. Do they not realize that the only mission of the prophets is to deliver the message (and that God has given the mankind the freedom to accept the message or to disregard it and that God has decided not to make people to believe by force?)
I have sent a Messenger to each nation to say: “Worship God and avoid alternative way of lives (exemplified in worshipping the idols in any form and shape.)” Once the way was clearly presented, some people deserved the Lord’s mercy and were guided by God, while the others chose the alternative ways. Roam the earth and see what happened to those who rejected the message.
It will be a wishful thinking of yours that God guide those who have chosen to reject the message. None can help them.
They insist and swear by the Lord that God will never raise the one who is already dead. Never mind them. The fact of the matter is that God has promised it and when the Lord promises, He delivers; what a shame that most people do not get it.
After having resurrecting everyone, God will point out what everyone has been doing (in his worldly life.) Thus it will be revealed what kind of the liars the disbelievers were.
As to how powerful the Lord is, to have something done, I simply say: “Be” and it is immediately created.
Let those who emigrated in the cause of God (in account of being persecuted), that their reward will be a good life in this world and, of course, their reward of the Hereafter is even greater (as it is everlasting;) if they only knew.
Such is the reward of those who choose the patience and in God they put their trust.
Any Prophet sent before you was a human being armed with My Revelations. If you have any doubt about it (and think that the Prophet of God must be an angel or something,) ask those who know the Scripture.
I armed the previous Prophets with undeniable miracles and the Scripture. As for you (Mohammad,) I am sending this Message (Qur’an) so that you teach the people what was taught in the previous Books; may they stop and think.
Do those who oppose the Message with their evil behaviors (exemplified in persecuting the Muslims) have any guarantee that God will not let the earth to swallow them or that their punishment will not catch up with them when they least expect it?
Do they not mind, if their punishment strikes them when they are sleeping and, therefore, incapable of escaping it? Know that they have no power to prevent the Lord’s punishment.
Their punishment may even be sent down while they are fearfully expecting it. The fact of the matter is that your Lord is the Most Compassionated, the Most Merciful (and that is why He is giving them more time so that they may wake up.)
Do theses disbelievers ever look at what God has created? Do they not see that the shadow of everything willingly submits itself to the will of God?
To God submits itself anything that exists in the heavens and the earth; including living species and the angels who prostrate themselves in adoration before God without the least arrogance.
They are at awe with their Creator, Who is high above them, and they obey their orders.
God has proclaimed: “Do not worship two gods”2 Know that your Lord is the Only God. Obey your Lord then.
Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. Your way of life (religion), therefore, should be the way sanctioned by Him. Now, would you worship other than God (by trying alternative ways of life?)
Any blessing you enjoy is from the Lord. Yet, whenever you encounter a hardship, you come begging God.
Unfortunately, as soon as God (out of mercy) relieves your hardship, some of you go back to your old routine of worshipping beside God.
This kind of behavior is nothing but ingratitude to the Lord’s favor. That is fine! Enjoy your [short] life on earth as you will finally find out.
They go far in ignorance up to thanking beside God for what God has blessed them with! By Lord, you will be questioned for your false inventions.
They consider their goddesses as the daughters of God! How funny of them to assign something to God that they resent to have.
When one of them is given the good news of having a baby girl, his face changes the color and he becomes overwhelmed with the grief!
Such disbeliever becomes so upset (with what he considers as disgrace) that he hides himself from the people while considering to live with such “disgrace” or bury her alive! What an evil decision to make.
Refer to the disbelievers as evils and to the Lord as goodness. After all, He is Almighty and the Most Wise.
Had God decided to punish the people on the spot for their wrongdoings, He would have left no one on earth. Instead, He lets them go through their lives (which its lengths is already determined in advance.) When Their time comes, they can neither delay nor advance it even for an hour.
They attribute to God what they consider to be a disgrace for themselves to own. Then they say all kinds of lies to pretend that they are righteous! Beyond any shadow of the doubt they have earned the Hell in which they will be abandoned.
By Lord, I sent them so many Messengers, before you, to so many communities What a shame that Satan made their behavior fair seeming to their eyes. Now the Satan is their lord on the Day of Resurrection and they have nothing but an awful punishment to look forward to.
I have sent you this book for two reasons: To point out the reality of the issues that they (Christians and Jews) are disputing upon and to provide guidance which will open the doors of mercy to those (Muslims) who have chosen to believe.
God is the One Who sends down from the sky water which revives the dead land. This is a miracle for those who have not shut down their ears to the truth.
Look also in the livestock (for miracle.) I provide you with a drink from their bellies. You enjoy drinking the pure milk which I produce from the midst of [fitly] digested food and blood!
As for the fruits (such as date and grape,) you can make intoxicants as well as healthy food. This also is a miracle enough for the people who think.
Your Lord has revealed the bee: “build your hive in the mountains, the trees or wherever else you are inspired. Then drink the nectar of every kind of fruit and follow the design of your Lord”
Thus, from their belly, God creates a colorful fluid (honey) out of which the man can extract healing medications. This indeed is a miracle for those people who bother to contemplate.
God has created you and will subject you to death. He allows some to grow old and learn as much as they can. Such people, however, at their old days remember nothing. Only God is the Knowledgeable One (knows everything) and the Most Powerful (not subject to aging.)
God has provided for some of you more than others. The wealthy ones never distribute their wealth equally with those who are under their authorities, thus making them their partners. Do they give up the Lord’s blessings (so that you expect God also share His Kingdom with the others and make partner for Himself?)
God is the One Who created your wives from your own species and, through them, blessed you with children and grandchildren.
He is the One Who sustained you with His blessings (throughout your lives.) How come then they turn ungrateful by [practically] worshipping less than God (who do not own anything in the heavens and the earth and can provide them with nothing?)
Do not compare God with any other “power” (as He is the Most powerful, and unlike other “powers” can be easily reached at through acts of worship.) Remember, God knows while you do not know.
Consider a slave who is owned (like man who is owned by God) and has no power. Then compare him with the one who (is being showered with so many blessings of Mine and) generously contributes to the charity (publicly or secretly.) Are these two equal? (If the answer is: “No”, then the Generous Lord is not equal to the helpless beings which are being raised to heaven by some.) Praise to the Lord, what a shame that most people simply do not get it.
As another example, consider two men. One of them is dumb and (like the creatures of God who are totally dependent upon Him) incapable of doing any thing good. Is such person equal to the other one who (like God) rules with justice and follows the right way? (If the answer is no, then why are you making good for nothing gods of yours equal to God?)
God is the Only One Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth. As far as God is concerned, from here to Resurrection is as short as a blink of an eye, ore even shorter. Remember, God is capable of doing everything.
God is the One Who delivered you from the wombs of your mother to this world. You knew nothing. He showered you with hearing, seeing and intelligence; may you show some gratitude.
Do the disbelievers ever look at the birds held in mid-air? Only the power of God holds them up there. For those who believe, this is an undeniable miracle.
Know that it is God Who has given you your home so that you may enjoy its peaceful environment. It is He Who has (given you enough intelligence and ) let you prepare tents out of the skins of animals which you find so handy when you travel. As for the animals’ wools, furs, and hair, He has taught you to prepare clothing and other useful things for your worldly life.
God has created for your enjoinment the shadow which is being cast by whatever he has created. He has created for you the caves in the mountain that you use as a shelter. He has given you the garments to protect you from heat; also the heavy garment to be used at war. He has indeed perfected His blessings upon you; may you (show gratitude and) submit.
Now, if they still disregard the Message, no problem. Your only mission is to deliver this Message clearly.
They definitely recognize the Lord’s blessings; yet [out of pride] they deny the. Most of them thus cover the fact.
The Day will come when I will rais up a person from each community to testify for their wrongdoings. On that Day, the disbelievers will not find any excuse nor an opportunity to repent.
When the disbelievers come face to face with their punishment, their begging for a lighter sentence or a second chance will be denied.
When the disbelievers encounter those whom they had raised to the level of God, they will say: “Our Lord! shame on us taking them as our lords.” Their lords will interject: “You were nothing but liars to say that we are equal to God.”
That is the Day that they will totally submit themselves to the Lord and all those things on which they used to rely will be proven to be good for nothing.
As for those who chose to disbelieve (and had something to do with the others’ leaving the right path), they will be double punished for their role in spreading the mischief.
On the Day that I will raise up a person from each nation to witness against their wrongdoing, I will ask you to witness against these people. After all, I have revealed this Book as a mercy to you to be served as a reference for explaining every issues, guidance, and relaying the good news [about the Hereafter] for those who join you in submission to the will of God.
God orders you to be just, charitable, and kind treatment of your folks. God forbids indecencies, evil deeds and violating the others’ rights. Thus, He instructs you so that you may mind.
Fulfill any promise that you make to the Lord. Do not break any oath that you have taken God as a witness over. Know that God knows everything that you do.
Do not behave like that (foolish) person who, after having worked so hard to knit something, pulls the thread and breaks it into pieces! Remember this example when you want to break your promises (even the ones which are not made by taking God as a witness for its fulfillment) no matter how powerful you (or your group) are. This is one way that God puts you to the test. Remember, on the Day of Resurrection, He will play back for you whatever you were disputing among yourselves.
If God wanted, He would have united you. But [this is not His plan. He wants to try the people’s behavior while their have freedom of choice;] He will lead whoever He wants (and chooses the rebellion) to the wrong path and guides whoever He wants (and shows the willingness to be good) to the right path. Remember, you will be questioned about everything you have done.
When you promise something to somebody, take it seriously. Do not let your foot to slip (after having firmly held on the ground) and end up in misery. Such is the consequence of tempting people to leave the path of God. If you do so, an awful punishment will be waiting for you.
Once you promise something to God, do not break it for any price (which will be too small of a gain for such a big loss.) Whatever God has for you in reserve as a reward is far better [than any worldly gain.] If you only knew.
Whatever you possess runs out. What God has in reserve for you as a reward is everlasting. I will surely reward those who patiently face the challenges of their lives and do good deeds.
Any righteous man or woman who has chosen to believe, will be granted a pure and peaceful life in this world. They will be rewarded for their good deeds.
When you read the Qur’an, beg the Lord’s protection against the temptations of the rejected Satan (so that he can not distract you.)
Rest assured that Satan does not have any power over those who believe and in God they trust.
The Satan’s power is limited only to whose who make him their patron and, by his temptation, worship (in any for or shape) other than God.
God knows what He is revealing to you. Yet when a subject is being elaborated in different chapters [or when an issue (such as the prohibition of drinking alcoholic beverages) is being scrutinized,] the disbelievers say: “You have made this one up!” The fact of the matter is, they simply do not get it.
Say: “The Holy Spirit has brought the verses of Qur’an intact from the Lord to make the believers firm in their belief, guide them, and give good news (about life after death) to the Muslims (an Arabic: those who surrender themselves to God.)
I am aware of what they say (in their gatherings) about you: “Such and such person is teaching him the subject matter of Qur’an (from the biblical sources.)” The funny thing is that the maternal language of this such and such person (that they are referring to) is not Arabic and that the Qur’an is presented in a perfect Arabic language.
Thus, God does not guide those who choose not to believe in God’s revelation (by coming up with such objections) and they will be subjected to a sever punishment.
The only ones who fabricate false religions are those who do not believe in God’s revelations (i.e., the disbelievers; not Mohammad.) Yes, the disbelievers are the real liars.
There is no blame on those who have to deny their faith under persecution, if they harbor it in their hearts. But those who renounce their religion (after having chosen to believe,) they will face the anger of the Lord and theirs will be a sever punishment.
By renouncing their faith, they declare their preference of this world over the Hereafter and God will not guide such disbelieving people.
God has put a seal on their hearts (so that they do not get it), their ears (so that they do not hear the truth), and their eyes (so that they do not see the fact.) Such people, naturally, become neglectful.
Beyond any shadow of the doubt, they will be the losers in the Hereafter.
On the other hand, God is Forgiving and Merciful towards those who had to migrate in account of their belief (as they were being persecuted) and patiently faced their challenges.
The Day will come when every soul has to defend himself and receive a full compensation for whatever he has done without the least injustice.
Imagine a community (such as yours) that used to be safe and peaceful and its people would be showered by blessings right and left. When they took it for granted and showed ingratitude towards the Lord’s blessings, God made them taste the hardships, starvation and fear in account of their wrongdoings.
Then a Prophet, from among themselves, was appointed to them. Unfortunately (instead of listening to him) they treated him as an imposter (as mentioned in vs. 103.) At last, they were subjected to their doom in account of being so unjust.
Therefore (learn a lesson from the above mentioned example and) enjoy all kind of lawful and pure (culturally non-repugnant) food, be thankful to God and worship none but Him.
The unlawful eating materials for you are the dead animals, blood, pork’s meat and whatever that the name (permission) of other than God is mentioned when being slaughtered. In case of emergency, however, one may eat even these unlawful food, for no reason other than survival. How Merciful and Forgiving is the Lord.
Do not use your tongue (that God has given to you at first place) and say a lie such as: “God has made this one lawful and that one unlawful.” Know that those who ascribe lies to God will never succeed.
Such liars should realize that the pleasures of this world is brief to enjoy and that a sever [everlasting] punishment is waiting for them.
For the Jews, I prohibited what I told you before (VI:It was not the Lord Who imposed hardship (such as the sanctity of the Sabbath) upon them. They are the ones who asked for it.
Yet, your Lord is the Most Forgiving and the Most Merciful towards those who do a wrong thing (out of ignorance) and then repent thereafter and reform themselves.
As for Abraham, He was a model in submission to the Lord. By nature upright, he never worshipped none but God.
He was always grateful for what the Lord had given him as a favor. No wonder the Lord chose him and guided him in a straight path.
I granted him the best (peace, happiness, guidance and not necessarily materialistic things) in this world and will be among the righteous ones in the Hereafter.
That is why I revealed to you: “Follow the path of Abraham (and not the way of the Jews or the Christians.)” He never worshipped none but God.
The Sabbath was imposed upon those who engaged in a dispute about it [and was not a part of the Abraham’s religion.God, certainly, will judge them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their disputes.
Invite people to the way of your Lord with wisdom and effective speeches. Debate with them in the most civilized manner. Rest assured that God knows who is wondering in the wrong path and who is following the right path.
If you decide to retaliate, be fair in retaliation. However, it will be better (up to certain point) to be patient (rather than revengeful.)
Go on performing your mission with the patience (knowing that the source of the patience is the Lord.) Do not grieve over them and do not be upset with their evil behaviors.
Know that God is with those who respect Him the most and are righteous.
Glorified is God Who took His servant (Mohammad) from Mecca to Jerusalem overnight to show him the magnitude of his kingdom. The fact is that He alone hears everything and sees everything.
God is the One Who revealed the Scripture to Moses to be used as the guidance for the children of Israel that: “You should not take anyone else but Me (God) as your protector.”
You are off springs of Noah whom I (God) carried on his ship; What a grateful servant of Mine was Noah.
In the Scripture, I forewarned the Israelites that: “You will become tyrant and arrogant twice throughout the history and behave against My commands.”
When My first warning was materialized, I subjected you to the power of a nation of My servants who utterly destroyed your country; a warning that had to be materialized.
Afterwards, I gave you the victory over them and showered you with wealth and children and increased the population of your nation.
If you choose to be righteous, you are doing a favor to yourself. If you choose to be evil, your evil acts will come back to haunt you. Thus, when it came to the fulfillment of the second warning, you were subjected to the other people’s tyranny. They brought you to grief and entered into your Temple the same way that they defeated you the first time. What a terrible defeat you were subjected to.
Now everything depends upon you. If you behave, God may be merciful to you. But if you go back to your old tricks (such as the way that Israelites have so far behaved in Palestine), I willsubject you again to the punishment. Know that I have made Hell a prison for those who choose to disregard the Lord’s guidance.
This Qur’an guides people to the most right path. It also gives the good news: “ A great reward is waiting for those believers who do good things in life.”
As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, Qur’an warns them that I have prepared for them a sever punishment.
In account of his impatience, man often invokes evil instead of goodness.
I offer the night and the day as two miracles of Mine to you. I have prevailed darkness at night and lighted the day so that you may look for your God given blessings. They also are used by you as a mean of calculation and the basis for keeping track of time. See how in detail I explain everything (in Qur’an.)
Every man’s fate is attached to his own neck (and depends on his own deeds.) On the Day of Resurrection, I will hand man with a record of his deeds which will be open to review.
“Read your records today and judge for yourself!”
Whoever accepts the guidance, has done himself a favor. Whoever has chooses the wrong path, he has done an injustice to himself. Nobody will be held responsible for somebody else’s wrong doing and I will never punish without first having sent a Messenger (to warn.)
Before I destroy a town, I send My Commandments to their elite people. When they choose to continue their wrongdoings, then I totally annihilate them.
Just think about how many generations I have destroyed after Noah (meaning that the Great Flood was not the last act of justice of God on earth.) Yes, your Lord reacts against the sins of His servants; He is aware of everything and sees everything.
If a person wants something very badly in this world, I readily grant him his wish at my discretion. Then I condemn him to Hell where he will burn and stay there forever disgraced and rejected.
As for the believer who chooses the Hereafter (as his priority) and strive hard towards it, his righteous acts will be appreciated.
God showers His worldly blessings (upon those who choose this life as their priorities as well as upon those whose priorities are Hereafter) and your Lord’s power to bless is endless.
Just look around and see how some have been showered more than the others with my blessings. In the Hereafter, too, people will be showered differently; the difference, however is far greater and more significant.
Do not raise none to the level of God. If you do so, you will end up being disgraced and helpless. 
Your Lord has decreed: You shall worship none but God. You shall honor your parents. As long as your parents are alive, you shall never say any word to them which implies disrespect. You shall not raise your voice over your parents. You shall talk to your parents in the most kind manner.
You shall be submissive and gentle to your parents and pray for them saying: “My Lord! Have mercy on my parents; they are the ones who [had mercy on me and went through so much trouble and] brought me up.
God knows exactly what is going in your mind. Now, if you choose the righteousness [instead of what your evil thoughts suggest], you will find Him the Most Forgiving towards those who turn to him frequently in obedience and in repentance.
You shall fulfill your charitable obligations towards your relatives, needy people, and stranded travelers (refugees) but do not be wasteful.
The wasteful people are like Satan’s brothers in the sight of God for the simple reason that Satan [like them] is ungrateful to his Lord.
If you [are going through economic hardship and cannot help the others and, therefore, you] are wishfully begging the Lord’s mercy upon them, put them off kindly.
You shall not be stingy. You shall not be extravagant either as you will be blamed once you end up in poverty.
Your Lord may increase or decrease the earnings of whoever He wills. He is fully aware of the condition of His servants and observes them closely.
You shall not kill your children in account of fear of poverty. I will provide for them (as well as for you.) Such killing is a great crime.
You shall not even approach adultery. It is a big sin and an evil behavior.
You shall not kill any soul (whose killing has been forbidden by God), except in the course of justice.. If someone is killed unjustly, his heir is thus given the authority to enforce justice. He should not go beyond the boundaries of justice (forgive, demand blood money or equality in punishment) and shall be helped [by the Islamic State.]
You shall not even approach to the orphan’s property except for their own sake (such as managing their investment) till they reach the age of maturity. You shall fulfill your pledges. You will be held responsible for them.
You shall give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a correct scale. You will find such practice the most profitable at the end.
You shall not follow (the guess work and) what you do not have any knowledge about. Remember, your hearing, sight, and mind will be held responsible.
You shall not walk on earth with arrogance. You can neither split the earth nor be as tall as the mountains.
All the above mentioned things are considered as sin and disgusting by your Lord.
All these wise commandments are revealed to you by your Lord. Remember, never set up any deity with God. If you do so, you will be thrown into Hell; you will be blamed and deprived of the Lord’s favors.
How come you are looking forward to have sons (which you consider them as a matter of honor) and consider the Lord’s angels as females (which you consider them as a matter of shame)? What a great lie to spread.
I have sent this Qur’an to be used as a reference and warning. Instead, the disbelievers dispute it!
Say: “If there were any other gods beside Him (as they claim), those gods would have tried [long time ago] to overthrow the Lord of the Throne.
Glorified and Above All is God. What they say are big lies.
The seven universes, the earth, and whatever there is between, testify for the Lord’s Glory. There is nothing that does not glorify Him; yet you do not understand it (as you do not have the scientific knowledge to see their submission to the will of God, i.e., the laws of the nature set by the Lord.) The Lord is the Most Patient, the Most Forgiving.
When you recite the Qur’an, I place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter an invisible barrier (to punish them in the most sever manner, i.e., depriving them of understanding.)
I have covered their mind with a shield so that they do not understand and made their ears deaf in order not to hear. Therefore, when you use the Qur’an in your discussion, they turn away, fleeing with disenchantment.
I know exactly what they would like to hear when they listen to you. I also hear these unjust people’s murmuring when they say: “Do not follow this possessed man.”
Note how they refer to you and how their attitude leads them further away from the straight path.
They [jokingly] say: “Sure, we will be resurrected after beings turned into bones and pieces!”
Say: “Yes; even if you turn into stones, iron, or whatever you consider in your minds impossible [to be brought back to life.]” They will ask: “Who will bring us back to life? “
Say: “The One Who created you at first place.” Then they will shake their heads at you [as a sign of making fun of ] and say: “When will this happen?” Say: “Perhaps sooner than you think!”
On that Day, when I call you (and you will respond with the utmost respect), You will be under the impression that it took only a little while.
Tell My servants (the believers) to exchange the kindest words among themselves as Satan is waiting to create disagreement among them. Never forget that Satan is the man’s worse enemy.
Know that your Lord knows you very well. Accordingly, He may shower you with His mercy or He may subject you to a punishment. You (Mohammad) are not, therefore, sent to be their guardian (and make those kind of decisions.)
Know that your Lord knows about anything in the heavens and on the earth. I have showered My Prophets differently. To David (for example,) I granted Psalms.
Say: “Go ahead; ask anyone beside God (whom you respect the most) for help. They have no power to help you nor can they prevent a disaster.
In fact, those whom people call upon for help (such as Jesus, Mary, saints, etc.), strive to get closer and closer to the Lord by all possible means. They hope for His mercy and fear His punishment. The punishment of your Lord is indeed a terrible thing.
It is written in the Book of the Lord’s decrees that: “Every habitation shall either be destroyed or severely punished before the Day of the Resurrection.”
Nothing can prevent the Lord from sending His miracles (that you are repeatedly asking for) to you. The fact is, the previous nations (such as the people of Pharaoh) denied such miracles (sending miracles, therefore, is not efficient.) I sent the famous camel (as a miracle) to the people of Thamood (for example;) they responded (to this miracle) by killing her! The main reason for sending the (past) miracles was to warn the people (so that they wake up from the hypnotic dream induced by Satan and come to their senses. What was needed in the time of Mohammad was a Book to relay the Lord’s Message to the entire humanity and to the generations to come, with a guarantee that it will never be falsified.)
As I told you before: “Your Lord is in control and that people can only go so far.” What I showed you now (reference to Mohammad’s out of body experience and his visiting the Lord’s Kingdom), as well as the nasty tree (of Zuquum) which is mentioned in Qur’an, are just a trial for the people (to test their degree of belief.) Thus I am giving them warning upon warning; unfortunately, their reaction to each warning is an increased rebellion.
I commanded the angels: “Fall prostrate before Adam.” They all followed the order save Satan. He said: “Why should I prostrate to one whom you created from clay?”
Satan said: “You see this thing that you have made superior to me? If you give me permission, from now till the Day of Resurrection, I will easily mislead his off springs save a few.”
The Lord replied: “Get out of here. You, and those who follow you, will be cast into the Hell; an awful punishment for your disobedience.”
“You have my permission to entice them with your voice, mobilize your military forces against them (read the history and see how many evil military forces have made the man’s life miserable), become a partner with them in their wealth and children and (above all) make all kind of promises to them.” Therefore, know that the Satan’s promises are shallow.
“As for My true worshippers, you will never dominate them as the Lord is enough of a Protector for them.”
Your Lord is the One Who is behind the forces that sail your ship through the sea so that you may pick up what He has gracefully provided for you. How merciful is He toward you.
And when you encounter a danger upon the see, you forget about all those whom you worship and turn sincerely to the Lord. But when He brings you safely to land, you forget Him. How ungrateful is man.
What makes you so sure that He will not order the land to swallow you or send a strong wind to harm you? Whom will you turn to as protector then?
Is there any guarantee that (in account of your ingratitude) you will not find yourself one more time in the sea facing another storm which will lead you to drawn? Rest assured that you will not be given a second chance then.
See how I have honored the children of Adam, carried them on land and sea, provided them with pure eatables, and given them superiority over many of My creatures.
On the Day that I will summon all human beings (with their leaders in front of them), those who will find their report cards in their right hands will find not an atom of injustice.
As for those who are blind to the truth in this world, they will find themselves blindly walking in the wrong path (leading to the Hell) in the Hereafter.
They almost succeeded in convincing you to walk away from My Revelations and falsify them in order to gain their friendship.
If I had not strengthened your faith, you would have compromised a little bit with them.
If you had given in to them, I would have subjected you to a double punishment in this world and after death. Then you would not have found anyone to stand for you against Me.
The disbelievers frightened you so much that you almost decided to flee. If it would have happened (as it happened a year later), they would not have stayed in power for a long time (as it took only eight years that Mohammad triumphantly returned to Mecca and after years everyone embraced Islam.)
Such has been the case of the previous messengers (facing the resistance of the disbelievers and their final defeat) and you will find the same true for you too.
Worship the Lord from the moment that sun declines until the night casts its darkness. Also, read Qur’an in the early dawn. This will be credited to your account.
As to the nights, spend a part of it in worshipping the Lord and studying of Qur’an. May the Lord raise you to a very high rank.
Pray: “My Lord, let me enter (into any situation) in an honorable manner and let me out (of any situation) in an honorable manner and bless me with your most powerful support.”
Declare: “The truth is revealed and the falsehood is put to shame. The falsehood was destined to be vanished.”
Send this Qur’an as a mercy and a mean of healing (mental, psychological, moral and cultural diseases) for the believers. As for the disbelievers, it brings their worse out (as they confront the truth.)
Man (is not consistent in his behavior. He) becomes proud of himself , when I shower him with my blessings (thinking he has “earned it himself), and becomes depressed in bad times (thus confessing with his behavior that his talents are good for nothing, if they are not backed by God.)
Say: “Everyone behaves in accordance with his belief. It is only your Lord who knows who is walking in the right path.”
They ask you about the nature of the spirit. Reply: “Only God knows about it and he will not let you more than a little bit about this subject.”
If I will, I can take back all My Revelations (the whole Qur’an) from you. If such things happen (as it has happened in case of the previous religions,) who is going to help you against the Lord?
Know that this [availability of Qur’an in its intact form] is out of the Lord’s Mercy. How gracious is Lord to you.
Say: “If all human beings and all Jinns (intelligent none human beings) gathered together and help each other, they cannot come up with a book similar to Qur’an.”
I have cited all kinds of examples in this Qur’an for the people. Yet most people insist in its denial.
They say: “We will not believe in what you say unless: You ask the earth to open up a water spring for us (as though the people of Moses submitted to him with the performance of such a miracle.) or ….
You own a garden of date palms and grapes, with rivers running through it; or ….
You cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you are threatening us with. You bring God and the angels face to face before us; or ….
You own a palace made of precious metals and stones or you ascend up into the sky. Even then we will not believe in you unless you come back from the sky with a book so that we can read it.” Respond: “Glory to the Lord; have I ever claimed that I am more than an ordinary person chosen to convey the Lord’s Message?”
What prevented the people from believing (when the Lord’s guidance reached them) is their questioning the fact that God has chosen a human being as His Messenger.
Say: “I would have sent an angel as My Messenger, if the earth was populated by the angels!”
Say: “I take only God as my witness (for your reaction to the Message as He is the One Who is going to judge you.) He sees His worshipping creatures (all creature worship God by submitting themselves to the biological laws imposed upon them by the Lord) and knows how they behave.
The only one who is really guided, is the one that God has guided him. As for those whom God has let to wonder in the wrong path, they will eventually find that they have no other protector beside the Lord. On the Day of Resurrection, I will summon them to fall prostrate while they are the most miserable: blind, dumb and deaf. Their destination is Hell. If by any chance it cools down, I will re-ignite its fire.
This is in account of their disregarding My Revelations and jokingly saying: “When we die and turn into bones and scattered pieces, will be raised as a new being?”
Can they really not understand that the same God Who has created the heavens and the earth, is Capable of re-creating them? God has granted them a lifelong time (to change themselves), yet they insist upon disbelieving.
Say to them: “Even if you had the Lord’s treasures of mercy at your disposition, you would have held it back, fearing that they may be exhausted!” How narrow minded is man.
I supported Moses with nine undeniable miracles; you may inquire the Jews about it. Pharaoh’s only response was: “I am afraid that you are a magician!”
Moses replied: “You know very well that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth is capable of presenting such miracles. I am afraid that you, Pharaoh, are doomed [in account of your denial.]”
When Pharaoh finally decided to erase them from the face of the earth, I drowned him and all those who were supporting him.
Then I said to the children of Israel: “Settle down in this land; when My promised time comes, I will summon you all together in one group.”
Truthfully this Qur’an is revealed to you and there is nothing but the truth in it. As for you (Mohammad), You are sent only as a Warner (about the Hell) and announcer of the good news (about the paradise.)
This Qur’an is divided into different parts and revealed gradually so that you may recite to people piece by piece.
Say: “It does not matter if you believe in this Qur’an or not.” When Qur’an is recited to those who are knowledgeable about the previous Scriptures, they fall down in prostration.
The latter say: “Glory to the Lord; His promises are always fulfilled.”
Then they fall down on their faces, overwhelmed with the excitement and are thus raised to a higher level of humility.
Say: “Call Him Allah or call Him Most Merciful, whichever you like the most. The fact of the matter is: to God belongs the nicest names. When you worship your Lord, do not raise your voice nor lower it down; use a moderate tone.”
And say: “I thank the One Who has never begotten a son, never taken a partner in His Kingdom, and has never been in need of any ally out of weakness.” Then glorify Him in the most glorious way.
Mankind should be thankful to God Who sent this Qur’an through His servant Mohammad and made His points in it sound and clear.
Qur’an is a straight forward book revealed to warn the disbeliever of a terrible punishment waiting for them as well as a generous reward for those believers who have chosen a God pleasing way of life and do good deeds.
The latter will live in Paradise forever.
Qur’an is revealed to warn a terrible punishment for those who believe God has begotten a son.
Those who believe that God has begotten a son, nor they fathers who taught them such a none sense, do not know what they are talking about. They are simply putting a few words together to make a sentence. God hereby declares that: “Saying God has begotten a son is nothing but a lie.”
O’ Mohammad I (God) understand your frustration that makes you so depressed when you see these people turn down God’s own word (Qur’an).
I (God) created the world as a place to test mankind and to reward those who are not enchanted by the glitter of the worldly life.
One day, I will turn this glittering world (that the materialistic people are in love with so much) into a lifeless desert like planet.
Whey then do you think I am reading the story of the “People of the Cave and people of Inscription” to you? They were among My greatest miracles.
When those youth took refuge in the cave (probably fleeing a persecution), they implored: “Lord, please have mercy on us and relieve us from our troubles.”
I answered their prayer and put them to a comma for several years.
Then I brought them back to life and let them guess how long they have been sleeping.
This is the true story of some youth who put their faith in the hand of their Lord.
I gave them the strength so that they stand up (against the pagans of Ephesus in Asia Minor, who were worshipping goddess Diana) and say: “We bear witness that God is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never adopt another lord beside Him; It will be very indecent of us to do so.”
Then they consulted among themselves and said: “What a shame that our people worship others beside God. If only they could come up with any proof to justify their behavior. After all, who is more wicked than the one who fabricates lies and pretends that they are revealed by God?”
“Now that we have denounced them (and have decided to worship none but the Lord,) let us hide ourselves in a cave. My our Lord have mercy on us (protect us from our persecutors) and make it easy for us.”
While they fell asleep in the cave, you could not have seen them in the cave as the sun declined to the right from their cave in sunrise and to the left in the sunset. This was definitely a miracle of your Lord [which was meant to assist them in their hiding. This is mentioned so that you] Know that whoever the Lord guides, is truly guided, and whoever is deprived of His guidance, will never find a guiding teacher.
If you had seen them, it would have appeared to you as if they were awake, when they were in fact asleep. I was making them to turn to their right sides and to their left sides. As to their dog, he was stretching forth his two forelegs at the entrance of the cave. If you (or anybody else) had seen them, you would have been frightened and run away.
When I woke them up, one of them asked: “How long have we been sleeping?” The others replied: “Who knows, perhaps a day or so …
only God knows. Now someone should volunteer to go to the town and get a good food for this silver coin, while taking all precautionary measures so that none know about our hide-out place. If our persecutors find us, they will either stone us or force us to join them in disbelief, which, in that case, we will loose our chance to succeed.”
Thus (when the man went to the city) I revealed their secret (which they, themselves, had not discovered yet) to every one in town (who had embraced Christianity while they were sleeping for some two hundred years) so that they know that the Lord’s promise (about the Resurrection) is nothing but the truth. Then people started to dispute about what they should do with their bodies (when they died shortly after.) Some (the true believers) said: “Let us construct a building over them (and leave them in peace) as this is the Lord’s business. The others (who succeeded in imposing their opinion) said: “Let us build a place of worship over them.”
Some say they were three men with a dog. The others say they were five men with a dog. The others dare to guess (about what is a part of unknown) and say they were seven men with a dog. Let them know: “Apart a few, only God knows their number. Therefore do not west your time on debating (with the Jews and the Christians) about this subject (as the numbers of them is not irrelevant), unless they come up with an undeniable document.”
Never say that you will do such and such thing without mentioning: “God willing.” If you forget to do this, you must immediately apologize to your Lord and …
say: “May my Lord help me not to forget to mention “God willing” next time.”
Some say, The Refugees in the Cave spend (solar) years ([lunar] year and 9 months) in the cave.
Say: “Only God knows exactly how many years they were in the cave. He knows every secret of the unseen, the heavens and the earth. He has the perfect sight and hearing capability. As a matter of fact, there is no guardian for the disbelievers besides Him as He does not let anyone to intervene in His passing the judgment.
You shall recite the words of God knowing that God has decreed that none can falsify Qur’an. Keep in mind that God is your only source of refuge.
Stay with those who worship their Lord day and night, seeking His closeness. Do not turn your eyes away from the worshippers, looking at those who seek the vanities of this world (as you may be attracted towards those vanities.) Do not follow those whom I have made neglecting My remembrance. After all, the one who follows his desires and is heavily involved with his own affairs is lost.
Say: “The truth is revealed to you by your Lord; let those who believe in Him follow it and those who disbelieve, disregard it. The disbelievers will be surrounded by the Fire that God has prepared for them. If these unjust people beg for relief, they will receive none but a boiling oil thrown at their faces. What a terrible thing to drink; what a terrible place to end up in.”
As for those who believe and do nothing but good, I will not let go waste their reward.
They will have their shares of the gardens of Eden wherein rivers flow underneath. They will be given the bracelets of gold and the garments made of thick fine silk. They will recline on comfortable furniture. What a wonderful reward and a wonderful place to live in.
Tell them the story of two friends that I had blessed one with two gardens of grapes (and all kind of crops) surrounded by date palms.
A river was passing through his gardens which would insure the highest level of production.
Being so proud of his “accomplishment”, he said to his friend: “See how much more respectful and wealthier I am compared to you.”
While entering his gardens, being so unjust, he continued: “I have made it forever.”
Then he continued: “To be honest with you, I do not think there is any Hereafter. But if, for the sake of argument, I ever return to my Lord, I will get even better than this.”
His friend replied: “Shame on you; Do you disbelieve in Him Who originally created you from the earth, then raised you from a tiny embryo into a grown up man?”
“I bear witness that God is my Lord and that I will never set up any other god beside Him.”
“When you entered your garden (instead of saying those words of pride), you should have said: “What a blessing from the Lord. Indeed there is no power beside the power of the Lord.” You are right; I do not have as much wealth and as many children as you have. But my Lord may shower me with better than your gardens. …
Do not forget that He may send a storm to destroy your gardens, turning them into a useless land.”
“He may also order your water to sink deep, out of your reach.”
Eventually, when he saw the result of his efforts being turned into a useless land, he was overwhelmed with sadness and sorrow and said: “I wish I had never worshipped another god (referring to himself) beside the Lord.”
There was none to help him against the Lord, nor could he save himself.
Know that the only protection comes from God, the True One. His reward is the best and the best destiny is He Himself.
Let them know that the man’s life in this world is similar to the (short) life of the plants. When I send the rain, the plants grow up. After a while, however, they dry up and are blown away by the wind. See how God is capable of doing everything (meaning: God can take what He has blessed you with, the same way that He turns the plants into hay.)
Your wealth and children are nothing but the vanities of this world. What really counts is your good deeds which raises you expectations for the Lord’s reward.
The Day will come that I will wipe out the mountains flatten the earth. Then I will summon them (disbelievers as well as the believers) without any exception.
They will stand in front of your lords in a row. Then I will say: “Now back to when I created you. This is what you claimed will never take place.
When their recorded life is presented, you will see how the criminals dread its content. They will say: “Pity on us. What kind of recording device is this that does not leave even the least deeds of ours left out? When they face their deeds in person, they will realize that your Lord wrongs no one the least.
Recall when I asked the angels to prostrate to Adam. They all obeyed. Satan, however, who was a Jinn (not a human nor an angel) disregarded his Lord’s Command. Do you then take him and his off springs as your lords rather than Me while knowing that they are your enemies? How unjust of you to treat yourselves like this.
They (Satan and his companions) were not present when I created the heavens and the earth; they were not present when I created themselves either. I do not take those who mislead the others as My helper.
On the Day of Judgment, I will ask the disbelievers to call upon those whom they assumed to be My partners . They will do so but there will be no response. They will find a thick barrier separating them from each other.
The guilty ones will see the Fire and understand that soon they will fall into it, yet they cannot escape the inescapable.
In this Qur’an, I have used so many examples to warn the human beings, yet man is such an argumentative creature.
The only thing that prevented man from believing and asking for forgiveness (when the guidance was presented to them) was their insistence upon the miracles (which did not change the disbelievers’ attitude in the past) or seeing the Lord’s punishment beforehand (which naturally would have been the end.)
I sent the messengers to simply deliver the good news (about the existence of Paradise) and to warn the people (about the Hell.) The disbelievers, in response have recourse to the most irrational arguments in order to reject the truth and to treat My Revelations as a joke.
Who is more unjust to his own soul than the one who turns away when to him the Revelations of the Lord is being presented? Such person forgets the evil end to which he has prepared the way with his own hands (deeds.) Such an attitude creates a shield around such a person’s heart preventing him from further understanding the truth. Therefore, no matter how much you try to guide them, they can never be guided.
How Forgiving and Merciful of your Lord not to destroy them on the spot. He allows them to finish their pre-destined life span and, then, subjects them to their inescapable punishment.
Thus I destroyed many towns (Sodom, Gomorrah, etc.) after having given ample time to its unjust people.
Now let us talk about Moses when he said to his young follower (who he was does not have any importance in this story): “I am determined to reach the junction of the two river (the place has no importance either), even though I have to travel for several years [to meet the man whom God has assigned to teach me a few lessons.)
When they reached the point [where they were supposed to meet the wise man,] they totally forgot about the fish that they were carrying. The fish, thus jumped into the water and disappeared.
When they passed the appointed point, Moses said to his company: “Let us take a lunch break as this trip has exhausted us.”
The young man replied: “Something strange happened when we took a break back there by the rock. The Satan made me to forget looking after the fish and it should have strangely jumped into the water.
Moses said: “That was [the sign revealed by God to indicate] the place we were looking for. Therefore, they retraced their footsteps back.
There they found one of My servants (probably Prophet Khizr) whom I had blessed with knowledge.
Muses said to the man: “May I follow you so that you may teach me some of the wisdom that God has blessed you with?”
The man replied: “You will not patient enough to bear with me….
After all, how can you be patient about something that you do not know anything about it?” (try to attend a lecture that you do not know nothing about the subject matter and see how patient you are.)
Moses replied: “ Please indulge me. God willing I will be patient and will not disobey you.”
The wise man said: “You may follow me on one condition: Do not ask the wisdom behind my behavior. I will tell you myself later!”
So they went. When they boarded a boat, the man made a hole in it. Moses said: “Why do you want to drawn the people? What a terrible thing to do.”
The wise man replied: “Did I not tell you that you are not patient enough to bear with me?”
Moses said: “Forgive me having forgotten it. Please do not be hard upon me.”
Then they continued their journey until they met a young man. Suddenly, the wise man killed him! Moses said: “Why did you kill an innocent man who had not done no harm to anyone? What a horrible thing to do.”
The wise man replied: “Did I not tell you that you are not patient enough to bear with me?”
Moses said: “ I apologize again. If I reproach you again, then get rid of me.”
They went on till they reached a village. They ask the people for food but they found them not so hospitable. Soon they found a wall about to collapse. The wise man took upon himself to fix the wall. Moses said: “You should have asked a wage for what you did (so that we could buy some food.)”
The wise man said: “Enough is enough. We have to separate our ways here. But let me explain to you why I did what I did.”
“The ship [that I made defective] belonged to a bunch of poor fishermen. There was a king passing by his army who was confiscating every boat [for the use in his army.]”
“As for the boy, I knew that he will become a big burden for his good believing parents by being rebellious and choosing the disbelief. …
It was the will of the Lord to replace him with a better, more righteous, and kinder son.”
“As for the wall, that property belonged to two orphan boys. Under that wall there was a treasure hidden by their father. As the father was a good man, your Lord, out of His mercy, wanted them to discover it, when they would grow up and being capable of managing it. I did not do nothing on my own. Now you understand the wisdom behind the happening of the events that you did not have patience to stand.”
They will ask you about Zulgharnain (Double honored man; most probably Cyrus, king of Persia who freed the Jews from the Babylonian tyranny. It may as well be a Prophet sent to a lost American civilization!) Say: “Here is a short story of him.”
I (God) gave him all kind of means and tools to establish his authority on the earth.
Then He (started to expand his kingdom and) moved to the far west and saw the sun setting in a vast ocean. He found a nation there. I revealed to him: “You may rule as you wish. …
If you want, punish them (for their wrongdoings and style of life) or (forgive their past behavior and) rule them with kindness.”
He declared: “Those who continue wrongdoings, will be punished and sent to the Lord (Who, in turn, will punish them severely.”
“As for those who choose to believe and lead a righteous life, theirs will be a good reward and I will treat them kindly.”
Then he made preparation for another expedition and traveled till he came to a place when sun rises (from the ocean) and saw a people for whom….
I had not prepared any [natural] protection (such as a hill or the trees, etc., i.e. a barren desert) against the sun.
I (God) know well what he was doing (therefore, this is a true story.)
Then he took another way and marched on till he reached a valley ….
whose inhabitants barely understood a word.
They somehow explained their concern about “Gog” and “Magog” and said: “They are hurting us a lot; will you accept money form us for building a wall between them and us?”
He replied: “What God has given me is much better than the money you are offering me. Just help me with your labor and I will build a barrier between you and them.”
“Now bring me masses of iron, blow heat on it till it turns red and then pour melted copper on top of it.”
….Thus he built a dam (as a barrier between the two parties involved) that they could neither climb it nor make a hole in it.
Then he worshipped the Lord saying: “See how merciful is my lord. This wall will be leveled on the Day of Resurrection which will surely happen as promised by the Lord.”
Yes; on that Day (Gog and Magog will come out and) I will let loose the people to come close together (like the waves;) then the horn will be blown, and I will summon them all together.
Then I will present Hell to the disbelievers…
those who were blind to see My Message and deaf to hear It.
Do the disbelievers really believe that they can get away with worshipping My servants (the king, the boss, the woman, etc) instead of Me? I have prepared Hell to welcome them.
Say: “Do you want to know who the worst losers are?“
“They are the ones who think what they are doing is good and that all their good deeds are nullified.”
The works of those who deny the Revelations of the Lord and meeting Him, are in vain. On the Day of Judgment, I will not take into consideration their good works at all.
Their reward for disregarding My Revelations and mocking at My Prophets will be the same Hell that they used to deny its existence.
As for those who choose to believe and do good deeds, they will be entertained in the Gardens of Paradise.
They will live in the Heaven forever and will never have any desire to leave it.
Say: “If the oceans were ink for [writing] the Words of my Lord, the ocean would run out, before the words of my Lord would be finished. Even doubling the ocean would not be enough.”
Say: “I am only a man like you to whom God has revealed that: There is only One God. Whoever wishes to meet Him, must do good deeds and worship none but his Lord.”
KHYAS
Here is how your Lord showered his mercy upon his servant Zechariah.
When he called his Lord secretly in a low voice.
He said: “My Lord! Because of my age, my very bones have become weak and my head is shining with gray hair and you have never refused my prayers.
“I worry about what will happen to my folks after my death, and my wife is barren. Would you grant me an heir out of your kindness
“One that will be my heir and the heir of Jacob (who was before me); the one who will please you.
(In response God told him): “O Zechariah, I give you the good news: A son whose name shall be John. No one like him has ever been created before”.
(Zechariah replied): “My Lord, how is it possible that an old man like me and a barren woman like my wife have a son?”
God replied: “So shall it be. Your Lord says: this is easy for me; the one who created you before that while you were nothing at all.”
Zechariah said: “My Lord, confirm your will with a sign.” God said: “Your sign is that you will become so overcome with the emotions that you will not be able to speak to the people for three day and nights.”
Zechariah then left that place of the worship and by the sign language asked his people to glorify the Lord in the morning and in the afternoon.
I ordered Zechariah’s son: “John, you shall observe the laws (as revealed in the Scripture) with the utmost respect.” Evan as a child I blessed John with wisdom.
I gave him tenderness of heart and saved him from any sin and he responded to these blessings with righteousness.
He was very respectful towards his parents. He was neither arrogant nor disobedient.
He was greeted the day he was born, the day he died, and will be greeted in the day of his resurrection.
Now mention in the Book (Qur’an) the story of Mary. She left her family to an eastern province to dedicate herself completely to the worship of the Lord.
She covered herself up and I sent to her My Spirit (Angel Gabriel.) The Holly Spirit appeared before her in the form of a perfect man.
She said: “I seek refuge in the Most Gracious from your presence. I hope that you are a God fearing person [with the least evil intention.]
The angel replied: “Relax, I am a Messenger from your Lord. I am sent to inform you that you are going to have a righteous son as a gift (in response to your devotion to God.)
She said: “How can a chaste woman who has never been touched by a man conceive a child?
The angel replied: “Thus has decreed your Lord, and He says: “This is easy for me. It has been My decision to send him as a mercy to the people, and to be a sign of Mine.”
Thus she conceived Jesus, and moved further (to Bethlehem in order not to be reproached by people who would have asked her about the father.)
She went under a date-palm tree to give birth. The pain of the moment made her to cry: “I wish I were dead, forgotten, and out of memories.”
Then she heard a voice beneath her (most probably baby Jesus) saying:
“Do not worry. The Lord thus informs you of a water stream which is passing under this tree. Now stand up and shake the tree to get fresh dates. Eat, drink and be merry…..
If you do not want to talk to a human being, simply use the sign language explaining that you have made a vow to the Lord to fast and not to talk to anyone today.”
Mary then came back to her folks, carrying the baby. They told her: “What a surprise Mary.”
“How could sister of Aaron (who enjoyed a good reputation in piety) do that? Neither your father was an evil person nor your mother an unchaste woman.”
She pointed at the baby (meaning: Ask him.) They said: “How can we talk to a new born baby?”
Baby Jesus [in the cradle started to talk and] said: “I am a servant of God. He has given me the Scripture and has appointed me to be His Prophet.”
“God has blessed me wherever I walk. He has ordered me to worship Him regularly and be charitable as long as I live.”
“God has made me to honor my mother; He has not made me a disobedient rebel.”
“I was greeted on my birth day, and I will be greeted the day that I die and the day that I will be resurrected.”
Such is the true story of Jesus, sun of Mary, about whom they (non-Muslims) wonder.
It is beneath the dignity of God to have a son. The Glorious One is so Powerful that it suffice for Him to say “Be” and, whatever He has willed, will be created.
Know that (as Jesus said:) “God is my Lord and your Lord (John 17.) Worship him alone (Luke 8), this is the right path.”
Unfortunately they divided themselves into different sects and presented different images of Jesus. Pity to the disbelievers on that Great Day in which they have to meet their Lord (and present the reasons for which they made Jesus son of God.)
You will see and hear them on the Day that they have to face Me. They will be totally lost.
Warn them about the coming of the Day that they have to face a judgment against them. What a shame that they are careless and that they choose the disbelief.
I am the One Who will eventually inherit the earth and everything in it. The inhabitants of the earth then have to return to face Me.
Now devote this part of the Book to the story of Abraham, a truthful Prophet.
He said: “Father, why do you worship these things which neither hear, nor see, nor can be of any help to you?”
“Dear father, I have been blessed with certain knowledge that you have not been blessed with. Follow me, and I will guide you to the straight path.”
“O’ father, please do not obey the Satan. He is the one who has rebelled against the Most Merciful.”
“Dear father: I resent seeing you being subject to the punishment of the Most Merciful. If such thing happens, then you will become Satan’s companion (in the Hell.)”
His father replied: “How dare you to reject the gods of your father? If you do not stop this nonsense, I will stone you. Now get out of here before I punish you.”
Abraham replied: “Peace be on you! The only thing that has remained for me to do for you is to beg my Lord to forgive you. He has always been the Most Gracious to me.”
“Now I will leave you and all those things that you worship instead of God. I will worship none but my Lord. I hope that I will not fail in getting the Lord’s blessings.”
In return for leaving his folks and what they were worshipping, I blessed him with Isaac and Jacob; two prophets of Mine.
I showered them all with My blessings and granted them an honorable position in history.
Now it is the place for you in this Book to mention the story of Moses. He was a devoted Prophet sent as My Messenger.
I called him from the eastern side of Mount Sinai and gave him a private audience.
I granted (his wish and chose) his brother Aaron (out of My mercy) as a Prophet [to assist him in his mission.]
Now Mention the name of Ishmael in Qur’an who (as a Prophet of Mine) had to deliver My Message. Indeed he was a man of his word.
He would invite his folks to worship Me on regular basis and encourage them to be charitable. God is satisfied with him.
Also mention the name of Idris in Qur’an. He was a righteous Prophet.
I have raised him to an honorable rank.
The above mentioned are (some of the) blessed Prophets of God originated from Adam whom I carried their grand parents in the Noah’s Arc. They are the descendants of Abraham and Israel. They were from among those whom I guided and chose. When the Revelations of the Most Gracious were recited to them, they would become emotional and fall prostrate while weeping.
Then there came after them generations who forgot to worship the Lord on regular basis, and pursued their lusts instead. They will soon suffer the consequences.
The exceptions are those who repent, choose to believe, and change their style of life to the righteousness. They will not be subjected to the least injustice and will be welcomed to Paradise.
The (unseen) gardens of Eden (which the Most Gracious has promised) belongs to His worshippers. Certainly, the Lord’s promise must be fulfilled.
There will be no foul language spoken in Paradise. Only peace. The inhabitants of the Paradise will be served day and night.
Such is the Garden which My righteous servants will inherit.
The angels of the Lord do not appear to you (Mohammad) except by the will of the Lord [and they will confess to you that: “Our past, our future, and everything between belongs to the Lord. Your Lord is never forgetful (and there was a wisdom behind a long silence during which you did not receive any Revelation.]
You shall keep regularly worshipping the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and whatever there is between. Do you know of anyone who equals Him?
Man wonders whether he will be brought to life after death.
Does the human being forget that I created him at first out of nothing?
I swear that I will gather all men and satans around Hell while they are absolutely submitted.
Then I will choose the ones who have been the most rebellious to the Most Gracious.
I know exactly who deserves to be burnt in the Hell.
Every one of you will tour the Hell (to feel how awful of a place it is.)
Then I will rescue the righteous ones and leave the criminals therein to suffer.
When My Revelations is recited to people, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: “How come then we are more prosperous and more powerful than you?”
How many of generations before them I destroyed while they were more prosperous and more powerful?
Say to them: “Those who choose the darkness, the Most Gracious will let them continue their appointed life span. Then they will see what is already promised for them (either the punishment or the Resurrection.) It is only then when they will realize who is the least prosperous and the least powerful.”
God will increase in guidance those who crave for it. What really last is the good deeds; and the Lord knows what a fantastic reward and destiny waits for those who do the good deeds.
Did you note the one who disregarded My Revelations and [sarcastically] said: “I will have lots of money and many children!”
Does he know his future? Has he received such a pledge from the Most Gracious?
I will record his nonsense and present as an evidence explain why he should get a higher punishment.
Such person will come back to Me all alone as I am the One Who will inherited all his belongings.
Such people worship their own gods hoping that they will give them power.
If they knew that the same gods will deny them and turn to be their enemies.
Do you not see how I have given absolute freedom to satans to entice the disbelievers to oppose the truth?
Do not be impatient; if you knew what I am preparing for them.
Rest assured, the Day will come when I will gather the righteous ones under the umbrella of My protection.
I will then herd the guilty ones to Hell so that they stay there forever.
No one will have the ability to intercede, except those who conform to the laws of the Most Gracious.
They say that the Gracious One has got a son!
What a disgusting thing to fabricate.
The heavens would like to crack, the earth would like to split asunder….
and the mountains might crumble down when they saw that the Gracious One has begotten a son.
It is beneath the dignity of the Most Gracious to beget a son.
Every single being in the heavens and the earth is a servant of the Most Gracious.
They are all counted in the Lord’s census.
All of them individually will be summoned before the Lord on the Day of Resurrection.
Those who chose to believe and did good deeds, will be loved by God.
Thus I have presented this Qur’an in an easy to understand Arabic so that you may deliver the good news (about the Heaven) to the righteous ones and warn with it the rebellious ones.
Many a generation before them I destroyed. Do you find any trace of them? Do you hear any whisper from them?
T.H.
I (God) have not sent you Qur’an to make your life miserable.
The main reason for sending down Qur’an has been to be used as a reminder for those who are at awe with the might of God.
This (Qur’an) is a revelation from God, the creator of earth and high heavens.
The Merciful is ruling his realm of creation and has power over everything in the heaven and earth…
and whatever is above and under the earth.
God hears your supplication no matter how loud or in a low voice you speak to him as He knows every secret thought of yours.
God is the One to Whom belongs all good names
Have you ever heard the story of Moses?
When he saw a fire afar, he said to his family: “Wait a little so that I bring a bit of that fire (to make a fir) for us or get a guidance (knowledge about what it is, where we are, etc.) from it (if he knew that he is going to get the guidance of his life from that fire.)”
When he reached the fire, a voice called out: “O Moses.”
“I am your Lord. Take off your sandals. You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa”
“I have chosen you; listen to what is going to be revealed to you.”
“It is I Who am God. There is no other God beside Me. Therefore, obey Me and worship me on regular basis so that you always keep me in mind.”
“Know that there is such thing as the time of Resurrection. I have not revealed when it will take place (to provide a peaceful environment) so that every soul work towards earning his reward.”
Therefore, do not let this (peaceful environment before the hurricane) turn your thoughts away from it and make you join the one who does not believe in it, has become a slave of his lust, and will perish.
“Tell Me Moses, what do you carry in your right hand?”
Moses said: “This is my staff: I lean upon it, beat down branches for my sheep, and use it for anything else that it may become handy for.”
I said: “Fine Moses; now throw it down!”
When he threw it down, the staff turned into an active snake.
I said: “Do not be afraid. Pick it up, I will turn it back into what it was.”
“Now put your hand under your arm-pit. When you take it out, it will shine (like a fire) without hurting you.”
“This is the second miracle that I let you perform.”
“Now go to Pharaoh. He has become rebellious.”
Moses said: “Lord, bless me with absolute belief.”
“Make it easy for me to accomplish my mission.”
“Please give my power of speech (which has been impeded as he put fire in his mouth when he was a child)….
back to me so that people understand me.”
“I beg you…..
to appoint Aaron (my brother) as my assistant….
to make me stronger.”
“Let Aaron be a part of my mission….
so that we glorify you together and….
worship you frequently.”
“Lord, I trust that you always watch over us.”
I said: “Moses, your wishes are granted.”
“I want you to know that this is not the first time that I shower you with My blessings.”
“When you were a baby (and Pharaoh of the time was killing all new born Jews,) I inspired your mother.”
“I told your mother: “put baby Moses in a box and let the river carry him to our mutual enemy (Pharaoh.)” I made you a lovely child and brought you up under My personal supervision.”
“Your sister (who was working in the palace) said: “May I recommend someone to take care of the baby?” Thus I reunited you with your mother so that she should not cry any more. Later you killed a man; I saved you from its consequences. What a trial you went through. Then you spent a few years with the people of Midian and here you are; exactly when I had pre-destined you to be here. Moses.”
“I have molded you for your mission.”
“Now you and your brother may leave, armed with My miracles, and never keep Me out of your mind.”
“Go to Pharaoh as he has become rebellious.”
“Talk to him in a nice manner so that he may listen to your admonition and mind the consequences of his rebellion.”
[When the two brothers joined together and wanted to pay a visit to Pharaoh,] they said: “Lord, we are afraid that he may subject us to an excessive punishment or that he may rebel (and harm all Jews.)
I replied: “Do not worry. I am with you and see and hear everything.”
“Go to Pharaoh and say: “We are two Messengers of your Lord. Let the Israelites leave with us. Do not persecute them. Your Lord has sent us with undeniable miracles. Know that peace is the reward of those who follows the guidance of the Lord.”
“It has been revealed to us that the punishment awaits the one who chooses the disbelief and turns his back to the truth.”
Pharaoh asked: “Who is this Lord of yours Moses?”
Moses said: “Our Lord is the One who originates everything and then guide them on the path of growth.”
Pharaoh said: “What about the past generations (who were not as fortunate as me to have the Messengers of God like you)?”
Moses said: “It is the Lord’s business. I simply know that my Lords records everything and that He forgets nothing.”
“He is the One Who has made the earth habitable for you, has put roads in it, and sends down water from the sky so that all kind of vegetations grow up.”
“You eat such plants and grow your cattle with. The functioning of the whole system is a good enough reason for those who are intelligent.”
I have created you from the earth, I will return you into it, and I will raise you once again from it.
I presented many proofs to Pharaoh; yet he denied them all and chose the disbelief.
Finally he said: “Moses, have you come back to snatch my kingdom by the means of sorcery?”
“I can also come up with a few tricks of ours. Let us then set up an unbreakable appointment in an open field.”
Moses replied: “Let our meeting take place in the day of the festival at sunrise.
So Pharaoh withdrew, organized his show, and came back to the meeting as planned.
Moses said: “I warn you, do not come up with fabricated lies meant to deny the Lord; He may destroy you painfully. Know that the one who tries to distort the truth about God will fail miserably.
Then they started to talk among themselves (and co-ordinate their activities.)
They said: “These are only two magicians who would like to take your properties and destroy your way of life.”
“Let us get together and face them and face them as a united front. whoever wins today has really made it.”
They said: “O.K. Moses, who should start first?”
Moses replied: “Go ahead.” Their ropes and sticks put a live show on the scene.
Moses was overcome with fear.
I said to him: “Do not be afraid; you will have the upper hand.”
“Throw your staff and it will swallow up all their sham fabrications. What they have come up with is only an illusion, and the magicians will never succeed, no matter how much of an impressive show they put on the scene.
The magicians {were so impressed with the truth that they] fell down prostrate and said: “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”
Pharaoh said: “How dare you to believe in Moses before getting my permission? It is obvious that he is your master (and you have got together to take my kingdom.) Therefore, I am going to cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you on the trunks of the palms so that you know who can inflict a more sever punishment (Moses’ Lord or me.)
They replied: “We are not going to choose you over the undeniable miracles of the One Who created us. Do whatever you want. The most you can do is to torture us (for a short period of time) in this world.”
“We declare that we have believed in our Lord. We beg Him to forgive our shortcomings and organizing this magic show that you commissioned us to do. God’s reward is much better than yours and last longer (and is worth to submit ourselves to your short term punishment.)”
Anyone who comes back to His Lord (from the battle of life) as a criminal, He will find himself in the Hell; therein he will neither die (and has to suffer continuously) nor live (after all, what kind of life is it if one has to suffer continuously?)
As for the one who come backs to Him as a believer with the accomplished good deeds, he will find himself among those who have received high ranks.
They will live forever in the gardens of Eden under which rivers flow. Such is the reward for the one who strives to purify himself.
I revealed to Moses: “Set forth with My servants at night and open for them a path across the sea. Do not be neither afraid (of Pharaoh) nor overtaken (by the greatness of the miracle of Passover.)
When Pharaoh realized that they have left, he went after them with his army, but the see swallowed them all up.
What a shame that Pharaoh led his people to the darkness instead of the guidance.
Children of Israel! I am the One Who saved you from your enemy. I am the One Who took a promise from you on the eastern side of the Mount Sinai. I am the One Who sent down to you manna & quails.
Eat of (and enjoy) the pure things that I have provided for you and do not pass the limits set by the law. Otherwise, you will be subjected to My Anger; the one who is subjected to My Anger, is indeed destroyed.
Know that I am Forgiver. The one who repents, chooses to believe, and does good things is a guided person. Moses rushes to meet the Lord after Passover:
“What made you to come here in hurry, Moses?” [Asked the Lord.]
“They are right behind me,” said Moses. “I rushed to this appointed place of ours to please you (in obedience.)”
The Lord said: “I have let your people go through a trial at your absence. Unfortunately, Samarian has succeeded in misleading them.”
Moses returned to his people in rage and disappointment. He said: “Was your Lord not fair with you in keeping His Promise? Could you not wait? Perhaps you wish to be subjected to the anger of the Lord that you broke your promise to me (to worship none but God)?
They [came with a ridiculous excuse and] said: “We did not break our promise to you. The fact of the matter is: we wanted to get rid of our jewelry and melt them down, as suggested by Samarian!”
Thus Sumerian made for them a statue of a calf which would make a sound. Then people cried: “This is your Lord and the Lord of Moses; how senile of Moses!”
Were they not able to see that the statue could neither communicate with them nor had the power to do something (good or bad) for them?
Aaron had warned them saying: “This is a trial for you. Your Lord is the Most Kind; follow me and listen to what I say.”
Their response was: “We will not stop worshipping the cow until Moses comes back.”
Moses told to Aaron: “What is the matter with you that you did not prevent them of worshipping the cow?”
“Why did you disobey my commands?”
Aaron replied: “Brother, please do not pull my beard and my hair. I was simply afraid that you accuse me of causing a division among the children of Israel as you had strictly ordered me against.”
Moses turned to Samarian and said: “What do you say for yourself?”
He replied: “Well, I saw angel Gabriel (that the others did not see) and I was inspired to take a handful of his foot print’s dust and throw upon the statue [making it sacred!]”
Moses said: “Get out of my sight; now for the rest of your life you should say: “Do not touch me (in account of leprosy as explained in Leviticus 45-46.” The time is appointed for you to receive your sentence. Look at your god for the last time as we are going to burn it and scatter its ashes all over the sea.”
Know that your God is the One beside Who there is no other lord and He has knowledge over everything.
Thus I tell you about some events of the past to serve as a reminder.
Whoever turns his back to these reminders, he will carry a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection.
What a miserable luggage to carry (on their back) on the Day of Resurrection, towards an eternal life in the Hell.
When the horn on that Day is blown, the criminals will be resurrected blue (like the cadavers who have lost their natural color due to lack of blood circulation.)
They will whisper among themselves asking: “How long ago was it? Ten (days?)
I am fully aware of what they are saying. The most learned one among them will say: “It was only a day!”
They will ask: “What will happen to the mountains (which in their eyes are so huge.)?” Respond: “My Lord will pull them out of their roots and scatter them into dust.”
“Making them flat.”
“You will see neither a dip nor a bump where they were (absolutely flat.)”
Everyone will silently follow the voice which will directly lead them to the Lord. All sound will be hushed before the Most Gracious. You will only hear the sound of their feet (as they march.)
No intercession will be accepted on that Day, except those that the Most Gracious has already given the permission and that echoes the will of God.
He knows their past and their future and none has His knowledge.
All faces will look down at the presence of the Living One, the Eternal One. What a failure is the one who has to carry the burden of his sins.
As for the one who has done good deeds and has been a believer, he will have no fear of injustice or a reduction in his reward.
Thus I have revealed this Qur’an in Arabic language (and not in a foreign language so that you understand it) with ample warnings so that people come to your senses and change their behavior.
Hi and above all is God, the true King. Do not be in hurry to see the whole Qur’an being revealed to you. Pray: “Lord, please bless me with more and more knowledge.”
I took a promise from Adam (to obey the Lord) but he forgot (and followed what Satan suggested him.) He proved to be weak in will power.
I commanded the angels: “Prostrate yourselves to Adam.” They all did, but Satan refused.
Then I reminded Adam: “this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Do not let him succeed in deporting you from the Heaven as you will be miserable.”
“Here you will never suffer from nor without cloths.”
“Here you will never suffer from thirst nor from the sun’s heat.”
The Satan, however, tempted them whispering: “Adam, may I show you a tree that (eating its fruit) will give you an eternal life and power?”
When they ate of that fruit, they found themselves naked and began to cover themselves with the leaves of the trees. This is how Adam disobeyed his Lord and fell.
Later (after going through a series of humiliating experiences) the Lord chose him (as His first Prophet for mankind) and gave him the guidance.
The Lord said: “Leave the Paradise. You will find out that some of you will become the enemies of each other! I will send you the guidance. Whoever follows it, will not get lost nor become miserable.”
“As for the one who refuses to worship me, he will have a miserable life and will be raised blind on the Day of Resurrection.”
Such a person will ask: “My Lord, how come you raised me blind while I had eye sight before?”
The Lord will say: “You disregarded My Message when it came to you; that is why you are disregarded now.”
Thus I punish the one who dares to go beyond the boundaries set by the Lord. Know that the one who does not choose to believe in the revelation of God will get an everlasting punishment in Hereafter, which is far worse (than any torture in the world.)”
Do they ever learn from the story of so many generations that I destroyed in the past? They walk over the ruins of their houses. What lessons to learn by those who use their brain and contemplate.
If it was not in account of a pre-determined plan of your Lord (to give man some time and try him in his freedom of choice,) they would have immediately been sentenced.
Therefore, be patient with them and worship your Lord before sunrise, before sunset, at night, as well as during the day; you will be pleased with your reward.
Never mind how I have showered different kind of people with so much worldly wealth. This is just a trial for them (to see how they behave in wealth.) Rest assured that What your Lord has for you is the best and will last forever.
Encourage your folk to Worship God on regular basis and strictly observe it. I am asking no offering (as the pagans were offering jewels to their idols) from you. On the contrary, I am the one who provides for you. Know that, at the end, it is the righteous who will have the upper hand.
They say: “If only he comes up with a sign.” Did they not receive enough signs from the previous Scriptures? (Why they did not believe in those signs then? These are just excuses.)
Had I destroyed them before (in account of their wrongdoings,) they would have said: “Our Lord, if you had sent any Prophet to us, we would have definitely followed him so that we would not be so ashamed and humiliated at your present.”
Say: “We are all waiting. You, too wait. Pretty soon you will find out who is in the right path and who has got the guidance.”
Closer and closer approaches to mankind the day that they have to face their deeds; yet they are careless of such a most important event.
The Lord’s message is being presented to them while they are carelessly kidding about it!
Their minds being close to truth, they say among themselves: “Do you believe in what this mortal (Mohammad) is saying? ….
Do you believe in sorcery and enchantment?” Mohammad said that: “My Lord knows everything which is spoken in the heaven and the earth; He is Hearing, He is Knowing”
They have called you names saying: “These are his dreams; he has forged it; he is nothing but a poet, etc.” They also say: “Why cannot he come up with a miracle like the previous prophets?”
Not even one of those towns which I destroyed believed (in the miracles of their Prophets.) Will these people believe then (if I give you a miracle?)
Before you, I sent many human beings to them as My Messengers to whom I revealed My Revelations. If you do not know about them, ask those who have inherited the Scripture.
They were neither immortals, nor had a different kind of body (which did not need food to survive.)
I fulfilled My promises with them. I saved them (from the punishment which was descending upon their people) with whoever else I willed. Then I destroyed the sinners.
I have sent you a Book in which there is all kind of answers to your issues. What is then that you do not understand?
See how many nations of the wrongdoers I destroyed in the past, replacing them with other people.
When My punishment descended upon them, they tried to run from it.
“Do not run. come back to those houses wherein you were enjoying a luxurious life and answer My questions.”
Their response was: “Pity on us; we bear witness that we were unjust (to our own souls as well as to other people.)”
They were repeating the same phrase again and again while I was whipping them out of the face of the earth.
Know that I have not created the heavens, the earth, and whatever there is between just for fun.
If I wanted to have some fun, I would have done it otherwise (it is beneath the dignity of the Lord to let sensible creatures of his suffer just for fun.)
Instead, it is My intention to give the falsehood a hard blow with the truth (as explained in detail in Qur’an) and let it vanish. Pity to those who fabricate lies about their Lord (Saying He has said such and such things, He has begotten a son, etc.)
To God belongs every soul in the heavens and on earth. Those who are close to Him, never feel that it is beneath their dignity to worship Him; they worship Him from the bottom of their heart.
They are never tired of worshipping Him day and night.
Can these earthly things (that they have taken them as their gods) create?
If there were any other gods, there would have been chaos in the universe (as is the case in the Greek mythology in which the gods are always fighting among themselves.) The King of the entire universe is far high above what they ascribe to Him (such as having begotten a son.)
God is never to be asked about what He does. He is the one who questions.
Have they found other gods beside Him? Ask them: “How do you prove that there are other gods? (Even their own books says there is only one God [Mark John etc.]) This Qur’an (which serves as a Warner for you) is the same that warned the previous generations. Unfortunately, most of them do not get it and just engage in a senseless dispute.”
All the Messengers that I sent before you, had received the following Revelation: “There is no other god except Me; therefore, obey (worship) Me (and none but Me.)”
In spite of this, they say: “The Most Gracious has begotten a son!” Hi above all is the Lord (to beget a son through sexual act like the lower forms of life) All Prophets (including Jesus) are His dear servants.
His Prophets do not speak on their own, and follow what they are ordered.
The Lord knows His Prophets inside out. They cannot intercede on behalf of none; except for the one that God will be pleased to hear a plea on his behalf. As a matter of fact, the Prophets themselves worry about their own fate!
If by any chance one of the Prophet claims to be a god or something, he would be thrown into Hell! This is the reward for an unjust person.
Are those who have chosen the disbelief not aware of the fact that at the beginning everything in the universe was densely concentrated (so concentrated that could pass through the eye of a needle,) then I exploded it into existence?1 Do they not know that I have created everything living species from the water? What is their excuse now in order to choose the disbelief?
I firmly established the mountains on earth to turn with them. I have also put highways on them so that they may travel.
Do they not see that I have established a ceiling on top of the earth (referred to as ozone layer these days;) to keep the earth safe and well guarded (from life killing rays of sun?) Yet they turn their back to such signs (which testifies for the existence and the greatness of the Creator.)
He is the One Who has created the night and the day (by ordering the earth to turn around itself,) and the sun and the moon which turn on their orbit and float (in the space.)
I have not made an immortal human being before you (Mohammad.) Now, if you die, will they live forever?
Every soul will taste the death. I will try you in good times and in bad times, and to Me is the return of all of you.
When you see the disbelievers, they will make fun of you and say: “Is this the man who does not believe in gods?” In fact, they are the ones who disbelieve in the Most Gracious.
Man is impatient by nature. You, however, should be patient and do not pray that I reveal My revelations to you earlier than their appropriate time.
They say: “If what you are saying is true, then subject us to the punishment that you are warning us about!”
If the disbelievers could see the Day that they are trying to turn the Fire off from their faces and from their backs while nobody comes to their help.
The catastrophe will take place all of a sudden. They will be so surprised that they cannot avoid it. The Event will not be postponed either.
The previous Prophets also were laughed at. But the same thing that they were laughing at (the Lord’s punishment) came to haunt them back.
Say: “Who is there looking for you, day and night, to protect you from the punishment of God, if it descends all of a sudden upon you?” Yet they turn their back to the Lord’s Message.
Do they have gods who can protect them from Me? Such gods cannot even help themselves when they are summoned to the Meeting of the Lord.
I have given to the disbelievers (as well as their ancestors) a fixed life span. Can they not see how, every day, they get closer and closer to the end of their life? Can they reverse this process?
Say: “I am warning you with the Revelations of God.” What a shame that the deaf cannot hear when the warnings are loudly shouted at him.
When they are subjected to the slightest punishment of the Lord, they (the same people who jokingly ask for the punishment of God) cry: “Pity on us. We were indeed wrong.”
On the Day of Resurrection, the scales will be reset to zero so that even the equivalent of a mustard weight of good or bad be paid for accordingly; no soul will suffer the least injustice.
I am the One Who gave Moses and Aaron the Book of Criterion. It was a beacon and a reminder for the righteous ones:
Those who are at awe with their Lord (even though they have not seen Him with their own eyes) and are always keep the Day of Judgment in their minds.
And now, I have sent down this blessed reminder to you. Are you denying it.
Even before that, knowing Abraham, I granted him a mature view.
He asked his father and his people: “What are these images that you show such a devotion to them?”
They replied: “This is our cultural root! Our fathers were worshipping them.”
Abraham said: “You and your fathers have been wrong.”
They said: “Are you serious or you are just kidding?”
He replied: “Not at all. As a matter of fact, I bear witness that your God is the Creator and the Lord of the heavens and the earth.”
“By Lord, I will have a few words with your idols while you go (to the festival) and return back.”
Accordingly he broke them all into pieces, except the chief “god” so that it may serve as a subject of discussion at their return.
They said: “The one who has done this to our gods (symbol of cultural identity) is really an uncultivated person.”
Some said: “We heard a young man by the name of Abraham was calling them names.”
They said: “Then bring him here so that he answers a few question before the public.”
They asked: “Have you done this to our gods, Abraham?”
He replied: “It was the chief of your gods who did it; you may ask them yourselves and see whether or not they are even capable of speaking.”
They consulted among themselves and arrived to the conclusion that they, themselves, were the real unjust people (worshipping the kind of gods who were good for nothing.”
They [were too proud, however, to admit it publicly and] returned to their roots and said: “You know well that the idols do not speak.”
Abraham said: “Why do you then worship these things (instead of God Almighty,) knowing that [they are good for nothing and] can neither profit you nor harm you?”
“Shame on you (and these gods of yours) that you worship instead of God. Have you lost your senses?”
They said to the public: “Burn him and save your gods, if you really care (about your cultural roots.)”
I commanded: “O fire, cool down and welcome Abraham in peace.”
They wanted to harm hi, but I made them to look like fools.
Thus I brought Abraham (as well as Lot) to the safety of a blessed land (fertile and most visited by Prophets.)
I blessed Abraham with Isaac (his son) and Jacob (his grand son) and made them both righteous.
I appointed them as the leaders of their nations so that they may lead them according to My Laws. I thought them how to be righteous, worship the Lord on regular basis, and devote a part of their income to charity. Thus they became devote worshippers of Mine.
As for Lot, I granted him knowledge and wisdom. I saved him from the corrupt people of that town who had indulged themselves in all kind of evil deeds.”
I brought him under the umbrella of My Mercy. He was indeed a righteous person.
As for Noah (who was earlier,) he cried to me. I listened to his prayers and saved him and his folks from the great disaster.
I gave him victory over those who were denying My Revelations. They were indeed evil people. This is why I drowned them all.
As for David and Solomon, I was witnessing when they were trying the case of the field in which the sheep of certain people had entered and grazed at night.
I made Solomon to understand the [above mentioned] case better, though to both of them I granted Wisdom and knowledge. I commanded the mountains to join David (and echo back his sweet voice) while he was praising the Lord, as well as the birds (to accompany him in his religious chants.) Yes, it was your Lord who did all these.
I taught David the art of making Armor coat so that you (inherit it and) protect yourself in fighting. Do you ever thank for it?
I let Solomon to perform miracles with the wind (send them at any speed anywhere and make his merchant floats [I King 10:travel faster.) Thus he could send the raging wind towards the land which I wanted to bless (with rain.) Yes, I am fully aware of everything (and behind every miracle performed by the Prophets.)
I had subjected to him some satans (which may refer to extraterrestrials or time travelers) who would dive for him (in the ocean) and do other (unimaginable at the time) tasks. It was I who did not let them loose.
As for Job, one day he cried to his Lord saying: “I am in distress and you are the Most Merciful.”
I answered his call, healed him and reunited his family together to serve as an example of My Mercy to those who worship Me.
As for Ishmael, Enoch (Idris) and Isaiah (Zul- Kafl), they were all patient creatures of Mine.
I brought them under the umbrella of My Mercy. They were indeed righteous people.
As for Jonah, he left his mission in anger, not thinking that I may punish him. From the midst of the darkness then, he prayed: “O the One beside Whom there is no other god, be you glorified, I have been one of those unjust creatures of yours.”
I answered his call and saved him from sorrow. Thus I help the believers.
As for Zechariah, he cried to his Lord saying: “My Lord, do not leave me alone (without any child and inheritor) even though (it is a pleasure to have you as inheritor; after all,) you are the best inheritor.
So I answered his call and gave him John and healed his wife. They used to race with each other in doing good and call on Me with love and respect. they were submissive to their Lord.
As for virgin Mary, I blew (this word is used here as a figure of speech) in her through My Spirit (Angel Gabriel) and made her and her son (Jesus) a [living] miracle of Mine for the inhabitants of the universe (terrestrials and extra-terrestrials.)
Know that you all belong to one nation and that I am your Lord. Therefore, worship none but Me.
As for those who have broken this nation into pieces [creating different sects and religions,] they have an appointment with Me.
The one who chooses to believe and does good deeds, will not find his works lost. His deeds are all recorded.
I have forbidden a second chance to those people whose community was destroyed by the order of the Lord. They shall not return.
Until the Gog and Magog are released and descend from every hill and mountains down.
Then it will be very close for the true promise of God (the Day of Resurrection) to take place. You will see the horrified eyes of the disbelievers while saying: “Pity on us! We never took this seriously; indeed we were so unjust to ourselves.”
They will hear: “You and what you took as gods for yourselves will become the fuel for Hell, once you are cast in.”
If these subjects of your worship were truly gods, they would not have ended up staying in the Hell forever.
Theirs will be sighs and the roaring of the Fire and they will hear nothing (no news, absolutely abandoned.)
As for those who have already been nominated for My rewards, they will be removed from the Hell.
They will not hear the least noise to distract their soul from enjoying their lives.
They will not be affected by the terror of the Event . They will be welcomed by the angels saying: “This is the Day that you had been promised.”
On that Day, I will roll up the space, the same way that a long letter is being rolled up. This is how the creation was started; it will be repeated again. This is a promise of Mine which will materialize.
Recall that I mentioned in Psalms: “The righteous servants of Mine will inherit the land.”
In this Qur’an, indeed there is a good news for the worshippers of the Lord.
I (God) have sent you (Mohammad) as the manifestation of My Mercy to the entire universe.
Say: “It has been revealed to me that there is only one God for you. Now, will you submit to Him?”
Now if they turn away, say to them: “I have conveyed the Message. I do not know how soon or late, the punishment of the Lord will descend upon you.”
“Know that the Lord hears whatever you say publicly or whatever you keep for yourselves as a secret.”
“For all that I know, life in this world is a mean of trial and a temporary pleasure.”
Say: “The Lord Judges with justice. Our Lord is the Most Merciful. Only His help is to be sought against what you attribute (such as attributing a son) to Him.
O’ mankind, Be at awe with your Lord and obey Him. Do not forget that when the most horrible earthquake of the Day of Judgment takes place, you have no one but God to seek refuge in.
That earthquake is so awesome that the kindest mother nursing her child will throw away him and that all pregnant women will miscarry their babies and that mankind will resembled to the wondering junkies without having used any drug and worse than all these is the punishment of God imposed upon the guilty ones.
Look how some people are disputing about the existence and the characteristics of God without having any knowledge and background just being turned on by any rebellious Satan.
The Satan has promised to de-route his followers and to lead them to the Hell Fire!
O’ mankind, if you have any doubt about [the Lord’s promised] resurrection, consider this: I am the One Who created the first man from earthly materials and then established the following system for your evolution. You were a tiny egg, then I turned you into a piece of an almost dried blood, out of which I brought up a little lump of flesh. Some embryos survive and some are miscarried. I am telling you all this in detail to make it plain to you. Thus the surviving embryos will stay in the wombs of their mother for a fixed period of time. I bring you then to this world1 as an infant and help you to grow and reach the height of your strength. Some of you die earlier and some of you are destined to see you miserable old ages, when you will forget all you knew. As an another example for the possibility of Resurrection, consider a dead land. As soon as I sent My rain, it becomes alive and give birth to all kinds of vegetation.
Thus you should realize that your Lord is Truthful. He gives life to dead and He is capable of doing everything.
Have no doubt about the coming of an Hour in which the Lord will Resurrect all from their graves.
People dispute about the Lord: A subject in which they do not have the least knowledge about. They have neither a proper guidance nor are they armed with an enlightening Scripture.
Such people turn their back, in account of their false pride and do your best in order to see the others lost too. They will have nothing but disgrace in this life and, on the Day of Resurrection, I will make them taste the pain of being burnt in the Fire.
They will hear: “This is what you prepared for yourselves. (Do not blame god for it as) God is not unjust to His servants.”
Some people worship God conditionally! If things go their way, they are satisfied with their belief. If they are put through the test of hardship, they will loose their faith. Such people have lost both this world and the Hereafter; what losers they are.
The real looser is the one who worships other than God (in any form or shape.) That is because, such idols can neither help him nor inflict a harm upon him (what a waste of time to worship it then.)
As a matter of fact, such “god” is more apt to hurt him rather than help him. What a miserable “lord” [to choose]; what a nasty companion to have.
As for God, He will reward those who believe (and do good deeds) by admitting them into Gardens where the rivers flow underneath. Yes, God is capable of doing anything that He wishes.
The one who doubts that God is of no help to him neither in this world nor in the Hereafter, has only one choice: to throw a rope up to the sky, mount it, make a whole in the sky, and get angry [for not having found a written answer to his doubt even up there!]
Thus I send My Revelations so clearly [in layman’s language;] God alone guides whoever He wills (and deserves such guidance.)
God witnesses everything. Therefore, on the Day of Resurrection, He will judge among those who have chosen to believe, the Jews, the Christians, the Sabeans (who believe that John the Baptist is the last Prophet of God,) the Zoroastrians, and those who have chosen the disbelief.
Do you not see that everything in the heavens and the earth submits himself to the will of God (obeys the laws of nature that God has imposed upon them)? Do you not see that the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, all living species, as well as lots of human beings (who, in their absolute freedom of choice given to them by God,) and even those who deserve the punishment of their Lord submit themselves to the Lord? The one whom God subjects to disgrace (and rightfully deprives him of further guidance,) none can give him the honor (of understanding the truth.) God does whatever He wishes.
Here are two parties (the believers and the disbelievers) who dispute about their Lord. The disbelievers should know that there are garments of Fire prepared for them and that the boiling water is waiting to be poured down over their heads.
The water will be so hot that not only it will burn their skins but also penetrate and melt inside them.
There are also maces of iron to lash them.
When they desperately try to get out of the Hell, they will be pushed back and will be told: “Taste the agony of burning.”
God will admit those who believe and do good deeds into the Gardens beneath which the rivers flow. They will carry bracelets of gold and pearls and wear garments made of silk.
They have been indeed guided by the purest speech (Lord’s Revelations) to the path of the Most Praised One.
Those who have chosen to disbelieve, try to deviate people from the path of the Lord, do not let people to have equal access to the Sacred Mosque (made by Abraham for the worship of God) that I have designated for the local people and the pilgrims, and pollute it (by putting their man made idols in it,) should know that I will punish them severely.
I appointed Abraham to erect the Shrine (in Mecca) saying: “Never associate anything in worship with Me. Purify My Shrine for those who will come to turn around it, stand up for prayer, bow down, and fall in prostration.”
“Call people to come (for the pilgrimage) and they will come on foot, and on exhausted means of transportations from far away.”
“Thus, they may go through the experiences that will benefit them (such as standing next to each other in inexpensive uniforms in the middle of the desert which will remind them of standing in front of the Creator in the Day of Judgment.) They will mention the name of God, while sacrificing an animal that I have provided for them at first place. They may eat from it and feeds the poor who are going through hard time.”
“Then let them complete their obligations, fulfill their vows, and go round the ancient shrine.”
Thus it was (duties prescribed by God for mankind who owes this pilgrimage to the Lord.) A good reward is reserved for the one who honors the Lord’s commandments. The cattle have been made lawful to you, with the exceptions mentioned. Avoid the filthy practice of idol worshipping and avoid lying.
Maintain your sincere devotion to the Lord. Do not worship none beside Him. The one who worships beside God, is like the person who falls from the sky ending up either being snatched by the vultures or carried away by the wind to a far off place.
These are the mankind’s obligation to the Lord. Those who establish the Lord’s rituals, in fact demonstrate the piety of their heart.
You have already benefited enough from your cattle (their milk, their wools, their giving rides to you,, etc.) before offering them as a sacrifice in the ancient shrine.
I have prescribed to each nation (and all of them, except the Muslims have forgotten) to sacrifice some animals of their cattle which I have given them at first place. Know that your God is the One and Only Lord. Submit yourself to Him. Let the obedient people know what a good destiny is awaiting them.
When such people hear the name of God, their hearts are filled with awe. They patiently deal with the difficulties of life, worship god on regular basis, and spend a part of what God has given them in the way of God (charity.)
Herding your animals to Mecca for the sacrifice are among the rituals decreed by God for your own good. Mention the name of God (asking His permission for the slaughter of a living animal) while they are brought in line for sacrifice. Once slaughtered, eat of that meet and also give to the poor people (whether they ask for it or not.) I have subjected them to you so that you may show your gratitude [by sacrificing them.]
It is neither their meat nor their blood (which is the basis for the Christianity) that reaches the Lord; it is your righteousness (in feeding the poor) which touches the Lord. That is why I have made them subservient to you so that you may your appreciation for His favors. Thus, let the charitable people know about their good destiny.
God will defend those who have chosen to believe for the simple reason that He does not like the treacherous unappreciative people.
Thus, permission (to fight and defend themselves) to those who have been subject to an injustice and God certainly is capable of helping them.
These are the people who have been expelled from their land unjustly, just because they were saying: “Our Lord is God.” If God had not willed to destroy one nation by another nation, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques (wherein the name of the Lord is frequently praised) would have been destroyed. God will give victory to those who bring Him the victory; He is the Most Powerful, Almighty.
These are the people that, if I establish their nation on earth, will worship the Lord on regular basis, engage in charity, encourage people to do good things, and discourage them of wrongdoings. It is God Who has the final word.
Do not worry, if they deny you. The peoples of Noah, Ad and Thamud also denied their Prophets.
So did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot.
So did the people of Midyan. Moses was also rejected. I gave ample time to disbelievers and then I called them to account; how terrible was My punishment.
I destroyed many townships in account of their inhabitants’ wickedness. Their ruins are lying upside down upon their roofs. How many wells are left useless and how many castles are abandoned.
Do they never travel to see these ruins that may make them to think and open their ears (and let the word of God penetrate in?) The fact of the matter is, there is nothing wrong with their eyes; it is the consciousness which is blind to the fact.
They challenge you as to when God will punish them. God never reneges His promise. The (calendar of the Lord, however is different from your and a) Day of God is equal to a thousand of your years.
I gave ample time to any a community in the past before punishing them in account of their wickedness. To God is everyone’s destiny.
Say: “People, I am only a plain Warner.”
“Those who choose to believe and do good deeds, they will receive the Lord’s forgiveness and a generous reward.”
“As for those who make it a business of theirs to challenge My Revelations, they will end up in the Hell.”
All Prophets and Messengers before you had to deal with the Satan’s intervention. God, however, reveals the true nature of the Satan’s suggestions and establishes His Divine Laws. God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
God has permitted Satan’s intervention to let people choose (in their absolute freedom, either to enjoy a healthy mind or) to have sick mind (the same way that the drug users choose to have a sick body) which becomes (increasingly) insensitive to truth. Thus the wicked is drifted far away.
Such trial, also, gives the opportunity to those who have earned the knowledge to realize that this Qur’an is the Truth sent by the Lord and that they may choose to believe in it (knowing and choosing are two different things.) God will make such people sensitive to His Revelations and guide those who have chosen to believe to the right path.
The disbelievers have to constantly debate their doubts until they suddenly come face to face either with their worldly punishment or the Day of Judgment (which in either case it will be to late to make a choice.)
On that Day, God will exercise His Power (and will end the freedom of choice that He has given to mankind and other creatures of His.) He will judge between His creatures. Those who have chosen to believe and done good deeds will be admitted to the Gardens of Paradise.
Those who chose to disbelieve and disregard His Revelations, they have to face their humiliating punishment.
As for those who were forced to leave their houses (and emigrate in account of their belief) and were either killed or died, God has provided for them a generous provision. Know that God is the Best Provider.
God will let them enter to Paradise and they will be very pleased with their admission. Know that God is the Most Knowledgeable (and knows what troubles His martyrs have gone through) and the Most patient (letting the mean people do all kind of wickedness in their absolute freedom of choice.)
Now for the one who has defended himself (by doing exactly what has been done to him) and then is persecuted (say by the irrational laws of the land,) God will help him. After all, God is Forgiving and (even though the retaliation implies the repetition of the same savage act, He is) Pardoning.
That is because God hears everything and sees everything (a Judge in an earthly court does not have such an insight and, consequently, cannot render the full justice. Besides) God is the One Who merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night (and such a Power, Who makes this gigantic earth to turn around its axle, has the final word in what is right and what is wrong in this planet.)
It is a fact that God is the truth and what they refer to beside Him (such as man made laws or a dictator’s rules or deified things) is falsehood. The Lord is the Most High, the Supreme.
Do you not see how God turns the land green by sending water from the sky (which by itself is a great miracle.) Yes, God is the Most Courteous, and Well Acquainted.
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. Therefore, He is the Wealthiest and the Most Praiseworthy.
Do you not see that God has put at your disposal whatever you find on earth? Do you not see that He has subjected the boat to the law that let she float over the sea (instead of sinking)? do you not see that He is supporting the sky (with the ozone layer) and does not let the heavenly bodies fall on earth (due to the laws of mutual gravity which keeps the planets from collusion), unless He decides so (such as falling of a meteor on earth)? Indeed God is the Most Kind and Merciful (in providing such a hospitable environment) to mankind.
God is the One Who has given you life, will put you to death and will bring you back to life. How ungrateful is man.
I am the Originator of the rituals by which each nation worship Me. Therefore, (now that I have sent you with this way of worshipping Me,) they should not dispute with you (about keeping their rituals instead of the way of worship that I am thus prescribing.) Invite people to the way of your Lord. Certainly, what you are inviting them to, is the right way.
If they start to dispute about the wisdom of their rituals, say: “God knows what is behind what you are doing.”
“On the Day of Resurrection, God will judge among you regarding all your disputes.”
Do you not know that God knows anything that happens in the heavens and the earth? Everything is being recorded and this is an easy thing for God. (If man can record the events with his newly invented video recorder, so can God.)
Yet they worship others beside God who do not have the least awareness of being worshipped as God has not given them such capacity. Such unjust people will have no helpers (neither God nor what they are worshipping.)
When My easy to understand Revelations are recited to them, you may see the spark of wickedness on their faces. They become so violent with those who refer to My Revelations. Say to them: “If these Revelations displease you, let me inform you of something worse which is the Fire of Hell that God has promised it to the disbelievers. What an evil place to end up in.”
Listen people; whatever you worship beside God, cannot create even a fly, even though they combine their forces together. Now if a fly of Mine snatches away something from them, they cannot get it back from it! How weak of a worshipper and an object of worship.
They do not appreciate the Lord the way He should be appreciated. God is Strong and Almighty.
God Hears everything and sees everything. He chooses His Messengers among the angels and human being [the same ones that you worship (such as Jesus and Holy Spirit) instead of God.]
He knows you inside out and you will eventually be summoned to his court for questioning.
O’ you who have chosen to believe, worship your Lord by bowing down and falling prostrate (the same way that all Prophets of God have worshipped Himobeying your Lord, and doing good deeds so that you may succeed.
Strive for the cause of God the same way that His cause is worthy of strive. He has chosen you and has given you an easy to follow way of life. you belong to the nation (of God worshippers) originated by Abraham. He called you Muslims (in Arabic meaning those who submit themselves to God) back then; and now your Prophet is a role model for you and you shall serve as a role model for the entire humanity. Therefore, worship the Lord on regular basis, be charitable, and hold fast to God. He is your Lord; what an excellent guardian, what an excellent helper.
The believers are the only successful ones in this world. 
The believers are those who worship God with awe and respect.
The believers are those who avoid worthless talk.
The believers are those who devote a prescribed part of their income to charity.
The believers are those who do not engage in immoral sexual activities.
The believers are those who have sex only with their own wives based upon divine laws.
Indeed those who do not observe divine laws governing sexual behaviors are the sinners.
The believers are trust worthy and deliver their promises.
The believers do not miss any of their prescribed daily prayers.
The believers are the inheritors.
They will inherit the paradise and will live in its best place forever.
I created [the first] man from some kind of mud (hydrocarbon/ organic compound.) 
Subsequently, I reproduced him by placing the fertilized egg in a safe place (mother’s womb.)
From the fertilized egg, I created the embryo; from the embryo I led him into a little lump; then I created his bones; then I covered the bones with flesh; and then, I introduced him to the world in his final stage of evolution. Congratulations to the Lord, the Best of creators.
Eventually you will die.
Then, beyond any shadow of the doubt, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.
Above you, I have created seven paths (universes within universes separated by seven layers) and I am never unaware of a single creature therein.
I send down water from the sky in exact measure. Then I let it stay on earth (in Aquifer.) Be careful (and do not provoke My anger) as I am capable of letting it escape (and then, even with an advanced technology you will become miserable.)
With this water, I create for you gardens of date palms, grapes, full of fruits so that you enjoy eating them.
I have also created a tree, native to Mount Sinai, which you may extract oil from its fruit, or eat it as some like to do.
Think about livestock and see if they can provide you an example (of how gracious your Lord is.) I let you drink their milk, take advantage of lots of benefits that they provide for you, and eat them.
I also let you use some of them as a mean of transportation, the same way that I let you use your ships for moving from one place to another on earth.
I sent Noah to his people. He said to them: “My people, worship God. You do not have any other lord beside Him; why do you not respect Him then?” 
The leaders of the disbelievers said: “This guy is a human being like yourselves. His only intention is to become your ruler. Had God willed, He would have sent the angels down. We have never heard none senses like this from our forefathers.”
“He may have gone crazy; just leave him alone.”
Noah then prayed: “Lord, grant me victory over these denying people.”
I replied: “Start making a ship under My supervision. Then, when the springs starts to gush the water, I will command you to take on board a pair of each animal as well as your folks (except those who are already condemned.) Do not ask me to change My mind about the wrongdoers as they must be drowned.
Once you embark on the watercraft (a simple boat as explained in 54:say: “Thank you God for saving us from the unjust people.”
Then pray: “My Lord, bless the land that you have decided to disembark me. You are the best in bringing to the most hospitable land to disembark in.”
This (drowning of the wicked people) should serve you as an example. I always put people to the test (and Noah’s people are not the last ones as claimed in the existing Bible. See Genesis 9:11.)
Later, I raised to power a generation of their descendents (The people of Ad: Al Aaraf, 69.)
I appointed someone of their own people as My Messenger to them saying: “You do not have any other Lord but God; therefore, obey Him. Are you not afraid of Him (doing what you are doing?)”
A disbeliever leader of them who had rejected the Hereafter (in spite of having received a good portion in this world) said: “This guy is a human being like yourselves. He eats the same thing that you eat and drinks the same thing that you drink!”
“If you obey a human being like yourselves, you will be nothing but a bunch of the losers.”
“Does he really mean that after dying and turning into dust and bones, you will come back intact?”
“Come on, come on, what kind of nonsense is this?”
“You only live once and then die. You will not be resurrected.”
“He has simply fabricated these lies, pretending they are God’s words. We will not believe in these none senses.”
Their Prophet said: “Help me as they have treated me like an imposter.”
I said: “Soon they will be sorry.”
They deserved the punishment that struck them. I turned them into ruins. The unjust people disappeared.
Then I raised to power another nation.
No nation can advance its pre-determined fate, nor delay it.
I sent My Messengers one after another. Any time that a Messenger conveyed his Message, people denied them. Therefore, I destroyed them one after another. I let their life stories to serve as a reminder for the next generations. The Hell with the people who chose the disbelief.
Eventually, I sent Moses and his brother Aaron with undeniable miracles and delegated authority.
They went to Pharaoh and his administrators but the latter showed arrogant. As a matter of fact, they were repressive people.
They said: “Do you want us to believe in two human beings, like us, whose people are already our slaves?”
They rejected those two Prophets; consequently, they deserved their destruction.
I gave Moses the Scripture so that his people get guidance.
I made son of Mary and his mother a sign of Mine, and I gave them both a lovely place (having meadows and springs) on a high ground to rest and have peace.
I told to each Prophet: “Enjoy eating the pure provision of yours and do good deeds and know that I am aware of all that you are doing.”
You all belong to the same congregation and I am your Lord. Respect Me the Most.
What a shame that people have divided themselves into different nations each happy with what they have (proud of their “cultural roots!”)
Let them enjoy it for a while.
Do they think that being showered with wealth and children is a sign….
that they will also be showered with goodies in the Hereafter? Not at all; they do not get it.
Those who are at awe with their Lord; 
those who believe in the Revelations of their Lord;
those who worship none but their Lord;
those who devote a part of their God given income to charity and they are looking forward to return to their Lord;
these [are the ones who will be showered with their Lord’s blessings in the Hereafter as they are the ones] who are looking forward to participate in good deeds and compete with each other in righteousness.
Rest assured that I am not obliging nobody to do what he cannot bear. I have a precise (with no video trick) record of everything (that you have done.) No body (in the Lord’s court) will be subject to the least injustice.
Given the fact that they care less about this (Revelation of God), they are engaged in the kind of activities that do not conform to this (Revelation of God.) What they do are evil.
When their wealthy ones are subjected to My punishment, they start to beg from the bottom of their heart.
“Do not beg as I will not help you today.”
My Revelations were recited to you; yet you turned your back and went on.
You showed arrogance and ridiculed the Messenger of Mine in your private parties.
Do the disbelievers ever consider My Revelations worthy of thinking about? Do they reject it simply because their forefathers had not heard it?
Do they deny My Messenger because they do not know him?
Do they reject it because some say: “Mohammad is possessed ?” My Messenger has brought them the truth. The fact of the matter is, most of them hate the truth.
If what they consider the truth had prevailed, chaos would have spread in the heavens and the earth and whatever lives therein My Commandments are revealed for their own good, yet they disregard it!
Is it because you are asking a consulting fee from them? Definitely not for the simple reason that what God gives you is much better than what they would have afforded to pay to you. God is the Best Provider.
In fact, you are inviting them to the straight path (and it is sad that they cannot see it that way.)
Those who do not believe in the Hereafter are in a path which gets far and far away from the right path.
If I shower them with My Mercy and relieve their problem, (instead of being thankful) they become more rebellious!
Even now that they have a miserable life (which can be translated in our today’s rampant divorces, increasing homosexuality, being infected with AIDS and other “Social Disease”, mean job environment, etc.), they do not return to their Lord and implore for help and forgiveness.
But when I sentence them to a sever punishment, they will implore in desperation.
What a shame that you rarely appreciate the One Who has given you the ability to hear, to see, and to think.
He is the One Who has established you on earth and before Him you will be summoned (for questioning.)
He is the One Who gives life, makes you die, and alternates the night and day (by turning the earth around its axle.) Why do you not get it?
Their response (to the Lord’s invitation) is the same as their forefathers’ saying:
“How is it possible to be resurrected after dying and turning into dust and bones? ….
No way. We have heard these things being told to our forefathers in ancient mythologies”
Ask them: “Do you know to whom belongs the earth and all its living species?”
They will respond: “To God.” Say: “Why do you doubt Him then?”
Ask them: “Who is the Creator of the seven universes and the Lord of the Great dominion?”
They will say: “God.” Say: “Why then you do not fear Him?
Say: “Who is in charge of the entire realm of creation? Who is the One Who Protects while none can be protected from Him?”
They will reply: “God.” Say: “Who has hypnotized you then (that you disregard His Commandments?)”
I have offered you the truth and you reject it!
God has begotten no son. There has never been any other lord beside Him. Otherwise, every creator would have separated his dominion and engaged in completion (as is the case with the Greek mythology.) God is much higher than what they portray Him to be.
He has absolute knowledge about what you see and what you do not see.
Pray: “Lord, if the punishment that you have promised has to happen any moment, ….
please do not include me among those who are consider as unjust by You.”
Your Lord is indeed capable of showing you the promised punishment.
Never mind their evil and counter it with goodness. I know exactly what they are saying about you.
And pray: “Lord, I beg for your protection against the Satan’s whispers.
A better prayers will be: “Lord, may you not let Satan to approach me.”
When death comes to one of the disbelievers, he begs: “Lord, please send me back so that I do righteous deeds this time.” ….
What a big lie (they will go back to their old tricks, if they are returned.) A barrier will separate them from the world till the Day of Resurrection.
When the horn is blown, all relationships will be forgotten and they will care the least about each other.
Those who have more good deeds than bad deeds are the successful one.
Those who have more bad deeds than good deeds are the ones who have wronged their souls as they will be confined to the Hell forever.
The Fire will burn their faces so badly that their jaws will be exposed.
“Were not My Revelations recited to you? Were you not denying them?”
They will reply: “Lord, our wicked desires overwhelmed us. We were indeed in darkness.”
“Lord, please take us out of here. If we repeat our mistakes, then we accept that we are the most unjust (and deserve this punishment.)”
The Lord will say: “Stay there in misery and do not speak to Me.”
“Remember those servants of Mine who used to pray: “Lord, we have chosen the belief; forgive us and have mercy on us. Of all those who have a tender heart, you are the Most Merciful One.”
“You devoted so much time to make fun of them that you did not have any time to Worship Me. You were simply a bunch of jokers.”
“Today, I have rewarded them for their patience, and made them successful.”
The Lord will ask then: “How many years did you live on earth?”
They will reply: “It seems like a day or even half a day. Please ask those who take care of accounting!”
The Lord will say: “So, you realize that it was only a short stay (and was not worth it to exchange it for the eternity.)”
“Did you really believe that I have created you in vain (with no mission to accomplish) and that you will not be brought back to Me (to present your accomplishments)?”
The Most High is God, the King, the Whole Reality. There is no other god beside Him: The Lord of the Glorious Throne.
Whoever worship any other “Unproven to exist god” beside God, has to answer to God. The disbelievers are surely the losers.
Pray: “Lord, forgive and have mercy! Of all the merciful ones, You are the Most Merciful.”
I (God) have sent this chapter and declare it as law. Thus I have revealed clear communication for you to be mindful.
Publicly whip each adulterous man or woman with lashes and do not have any pity on them, if you believe in God and the day of judgment. 
It is prohibited for an adulterous man to marry with a believing (chaste) woman. It is also prohibited for an adulterous woman to marry with a believing man. The adulterous men or women should marry their own kind or (worse) to the idol worshippers.
Whip the one who accuses a married woman of adultery (without backing his accusation by four witnesses) eighty lashes. Never again accept his testimony as such a person is corrupt.
If such a person repents and reforms himself, he will find God the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
As for the one who accuses his own wife of adultery (without having any witness,) Let him swear four times by God that he is telling the truth.
He has to swear the fifth time, mentioning that if his testimony is false, may God never forgive him (and send him directly to the Hell.)
If the accused wife wants to escape the punishment, she should swear four times by God that her husband is giving a false testimony.
Then she should swear for the fifth time, mentioning that if her testimony is false, may God’s anger be upon her. (Although it is horrible to be subjected to the Lord’s anger, it is better than not having any opportunity for forgiveness as is the case of the man’s fifth time’s swearing.)
Had it not been for the Grace of God and His Mercy on you (you would have been punished immediately without having a chance to repent.) Thus God, the Most Wise (gives you the good news that He) is the One Who accepts (the sincere) repentance.
A gang among you came up with the slander (against your wife Aisha.) Do not consider this slander as counter-productive. As a matter of fact, it has been a blessing in disguise for you (to know the hypocrites.) Those who took any part in this have their share of the sin and the one who has been the most adamant shall have a terrible punishment.
When the rumors started to circulate, the believers should have shown their goodness of heart saying: “This is a great slander.”
Only if they can come up with four witnesses, they are credible; otherwise, according to God, they are liars.
If it were not for the Lord’s Grace (and the Mercy that He has showered the world and the Hereafter with,) you would have been harshly punished in account of this incidence (slandering an innocent woman.)
You fabricated a lie and then the others (without knowing it for sure) circulated it by using their tongues (that God has given to be used for good purposes.) You took it lightly, while it is was a grave offence in the sight of God.
When you heard the rumor, you should have said: “We are not going to spread it. We take refuge in God, this is indeed a great slander.”
Thus God reminds you not to get involved in a slander (that you are not sure about it,) if you claim to be a believer.
God, the Most Knowledgeable and the Most Wise, thus plainly explains His Commandments to you.
Those who like to spread these kinds of indecencies (back biting, slandering, etc.) among the believers, will be subjected to a painful punishment in this world, as well as in the Hereafter. That is because God knows and you do not know (what are the consequences of immoralities upon the future of the society.)
If you only knew what would have happened to you, if God had not shown His Grace and Mercy to you. Indeed God is the Most Merciful, the Most Forgiving.
O’ you who have believed, do not follow the path of Satan. The one who follows the Satan’s footstep, submits himself to his orders, i.e., getting involved in indecencies and the denial of the truth. Had it not been for the Grace of God and His Mercy on you, none would have been purified. But God purifies whoever He wills as He hears everything and is knows everything.
Those among you whom God has blessed with wealth should not say that they will never again help their relatives, poor people, and those who have immigrated for the cause of the Lord (because of the disappointing experiences that they have had with them.) They should forgive (if they have said or done something wrong) and treat them with tolerance. Do you not wish to be pardoned by God? Yes, indeed the Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.
Those who falsely accuse the married women (who are pious believers,) have earned the curse of God in this life as well as in the Hereafter. They will be subjected to a horrible punishment.
Such people should know that, on the Day of Judgment, their own tongues, hands, and legs will testify against them and reveal what they used to do.
On that Day, God will pay what they deserve in full and they will finally realize that there is a God and that He is the Whole Truth.
Bad women are meant for bad men and vice versa. On the other hand, good women are meant for good men and vice versa. The latter are far from any slander meant to destroy their reputations. God will embrace them with His forgiveness and will provide them with a generous provision.
O’ you who believe, do not enter the other people’s home without having their invitation. When you enter people’s home, wish them “Peace.” Make a habit of it as it is a good behavior.
If you knock at the door and nobody answers, do not enter. If your request for the entrance is refused, leave the premises; this is a good behavior. Do not forget that God sees what you are doing.
You may enter an abandoned house, if there is something of interest therein for you. In any case, keep in mind that God knows what you publicly reveal and what you keep as a secret for yourselves.
Tell the believing men not to stare at women and not to reveal their private parts (from the naval to the knee.) This is very decent of them. Indeed God knows what they do.
As for believing women, let them know that they should not stare at men. They should not reveal their private parts (any part except the face, palm of the hand and feet from the ankle down) and not to show off their adornments (except it is revealed unintentionally.) They should cover their chests with their veils and reveal their adornments only to the followings: their husbands, their fathers, their husband’s fathers, their sons, their husband’s sons, their brothers, their brother’s sons, their sister’s sons, their sisters in Islam, their female slaves, their male subordinates who do not have any sexual desire and the small children. Also, they should not strike their feet to reveal their adornments. All of you should ask for the Lord’s forgiveness so that you may succeed.
It is an obligation of yours to bring single men and single women together in marriage. Also, facilitate the marriage of your pious slaves. The poverty should not be a matter of consideration in marriage as God will provide for the married couples out of His Grace.
Those who cannot find a match, must maintain morality. They should wait until God showers them out of His Grace. As for those slaves of yours who wish to be free and then marry (and you find them responsible people), grant them their freedom; also give them some capital out of what God has given you at first place. Do not force your female slaves into prostitution so that you make a little bit money. If the female slaved are forced to do so, God will forgive them as He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
I have sent you My easy to understand Revelations, which include the examples of the past generations, to be used as warnings for the righteous people.
God is the light of the heavens and the earth. Imagine a concave mirror behind a lamp which is placed inside a glass container. Imagine this container being like a bright, pearl-like star. Imagine the lamp being fueled by a blessed oil-producing tree, that you cannot find neither in the east nor in the west. Its oil is almost self-radiating; needs no fire to ignite it. Light upon light is the God’s light with which He guides whoever He wills. God thus explains (difficult to understand matters) so that mankind have some idea. Know that God knows everything.
You will find the light of God in the houses blessed by the Lord. The houses in which His name is being glorified day and night
In these houses, you will find in people who do not let the business and making money come between them and worshipping the Lord and participation in the charities. They are afraid of being at loss on the Day that the hearts and the eyes will be horrified.
God will raise their good acts to the heaven and increase their reward out of His Grace; after all, God can shower anyone He wills without measure.
As for those who rejected (this Qur’an,) their deeds are like a mirage. It gives them the allusion of water in a desert; but when they reach there, instead of water, they will find the Lord ready to question the figures in their accounts. God is the Most Efficient in Accounting.
Their case may also be likened to a man who find himself in the middle of a violent ocean. There are waves upon waves. It is so dark that he cannot even see his own hand when stretching it for swimming in desperation. The one whom God has deprived of light, cannot find any light.
Do you not see that all creatures in the heavens and the earth worship the Lord? Look at the birds who open their wings in the air. They all know how to worship and glorify Him in their own ways; and God knows what they all are doing.
To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all have to return back to Him.
Do you not see that God raises the clouds, then unites them together, then concentrates them and let them shower their rain? He is the One Who sends the hail from the mountains of clouds, hurting whoever He wants and sparing whoever He wants. Look at the lightning sent from the same clouds which almost blinds the eyes.
God alternates night and the day. In this alone, there are lessons for those who have inquisitive mind (to discover the rotation of the earth and appreciate the power which makes the earth turn around its axel.)
God has originated every creature in the water (confirmation of the theory of the evolution.) Among them, some crawl on their bellies, some walk on their two legs, and some run using their four legs. Thus God creates whatever He wants and has power over everything.
Thus I have sent you My plains Revelations (which are easy to understand) to guide those whom I want to the straight path.
Some say: “We bear witness that we have chosen to believe in God and His Messenger and we are going to submit ourselves.” Soon after, however, a group of them forget their pledges. The latter are definitely not the believers.
When they are called tot he court of God so that His Messengers judge their cases, some of them turn away.
However, if the judgment is in their favor, they will happily accept it!
Are they sick? Do they still have doubts? Are they afraid that God and His Messenger will not judge them in fairness? The fact of the matter is, they are unjust people.
As for the believers, when they are summoned to the court of the Lord for the judgment, they simply say: “We heard the call and we obey.” These are the kind of people who will succeed.
Those who obey God and His Messenger, are at awe with the Lord, and never disobey Him are the successful ones.
They swear by God that if they are called to serve in the army, they will leave their homes to join. Say: “Do not swear; obedience is an obligation. God knows what you are doing.”
Say: “Obey God and His Messenger.” If they turn their back, they will be held responsible for their choice and you will be held responsible for the accomplishment of your mission. Those who obey, they are guided. The responsibility of the Messenger is only to properly convey the Message.”
God promises those believers who lead a righteous life, that He will establish them with power on earth. He did it for the previous nations. He will establish for them the religion He has chosen for them, and will create an environment for them inwhich fear will be replaced by peace and security. All this in account of their choosing to worship Me alone and not to worship anyone else. Those who choose to disbelieve now are truly corrupt.
Worship the Lord on regular basis, devote a part of your God given income to charity, and follow the Prophet so that He may show Mercy on you.
Do not think that those who rebel against the Lord can frustrate Him the least in this world. As a matter of fact they are going to live in the Hell which is an evil place.
O’ you who believe, You may have privacy of your own three times a day: Before the Dawn Prayer, at noon (when you usually change your clothes to have a siesta,) and after the Night Prayer. Your servants and the children who have not attained puberty must ask permission to disturb your privacy. At other times, it does not matter if you mingle with one another. GOD thus makes His revelations clear for you. GOD knows everything and is the Most Wise.
When your children grow up, they should continue asking permission as before. God, the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise, thus makes His revelations clear to you.
The elderly women, who have given up the idea of marriage may relax their dress code, provided they do not reveal too much of their bodies. It will be the best, if they continue observing their dress code. Know that God hears everything and knows everything.
There is no blame if a blind, a handicap, or a sick person eats in somebody else’s house, just as you are not to be blamed for eating at your homes, or the homes of your fathers, or the homes of your mothers, or the homes of your brothers, or the homes of your sisters, or the homes of your fathers’ brothers, or the homes of your fathers’ sisters, or the homes of your mothers’ brothers, or the homes of your mothers’ sisters, or the homes that belong to you and you possess their keys, or the homes of your friends. You commit nothing wrong by eating together or as individuals. However, when you enter any home, you shall greet each other by the words of peace, which God has blessed and taught you. GOD thus explains His Revelations plainly and in detail for you so that you may understand.
The true believers are those who believe in GOD and His messenger. When they are with the Prophet in a formal gathering, they do not leave him without excusing themselves. Those do so are the ones who do believe in God and His messenger. If they ask your permission to leave, you may grant their wish, and ask God to forgive them. God is the Most Forgiver, Most Merciful.
Do not treat the messenger’s call for gathering as you treat each others’ invitation to get together. God is fully aware of those among you who sneak away quietly. Let It be known that those who disobey the Prophet’s orders are making themselves vulnerable to the disasters or the Lord’s punishment.
Know that everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. He knows exactly what you are going through and He visualizes you the Day when you will be brought back to Him. On that Day, He will inform you of what you have don. Know that God has full knowledge of everything.
Honored in worship is God Who revealed Qur’an as a standard (upon which a firm decision may be reached) to His servant Mohammad to warn mankind.
(Honored in worship is) The One to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. The one Who never had a son or partner in His Kingdom. The one Who created everything in the most perfect manner and then directed them toward their destiny.
How pity of the unbelievers who have chosen beside Him gods which not only have not created anything but they themselves are being created! These said “gods” can not only harm or benefit themselves but also do not have any power over death, life or resurrection.
Those who disbelieve say: “This Qur’an is nothing but a bunch of lies fabricated by Mohammad with the help of others.” In fact it is they who have fabricated a lie and how unjust of them.
The unbeliever say: “Qur’an is nothing but ancient stories/ myths given to him in writing early in the morning and at night (when nobody witnesses it).”
Say (to them, O’ Mohammad): “This Qur’an is revealed by the One Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth; the One Who is the most Forgiving, the most Merciful.”
And they say: “What kind of Prophet is Mohammad who eats and goes to the market like all of us? Why has not an Angle been sent down with him to make people at awe as a helper in his mission?”
Or, “How come God has not sent him a treasure from the Heaven or an earthly garden to provide his needs?” The unbelievers than arrive to the conclusion that: “You are following the one who is a cast spelled over.”
See Mohammad how they called you all kind of names! In account of this mean attitude of theirs, they will never find the right path.
Honored in worship is God, that if he decides, will give you much more than what makes them at awe: gardens with running rivers in it and splendid mansions.
The unbelievers, thus, have denied the upcoming Hour of the judgment. A blazing fire is prepared for them when that Hour arrives.
When they approach from afar, the Hell will welcome them with rage while roaring with fumes.
Bound together with ropes, and being whipped, they will be go through a narrow place; they wish they were dead.
“Today, your wish will come true; not only once, you will die many times!”
Say: “Now, is this better or the Paradise for eternity which is promised to the righteous ones as their reward and final destination?”
This promise is binging upon your Lord to let them live in the Paradise forever and give them anything that they desire.
On the Day of Resurrection, the Lord will gather them together along with what they were used to worship besides God (idols, angels, saints, Jesus, etc.) Then He will say: “Was it you who misled these creatures of Mine or did they themselves chose to deviate from the straight path?”
They will say, “Glory to you, it was not right for us to pretend that we are like You. You allowed them, as well as their parents, to make choices of their own. They [abused their freedom of choice] and disregarded the Message. Thus they turned into wicked people.”
Once they will testify against you, you will have no recourse to an appeal or any kind of help as I will make the guilty ones to taste an awful punishment.
The previous Prophets also ate food and walked in the streets. In fact, I am testing you by the means of each other. Be patient as your Lord is watching.
Those who mind the least their meeting with Me on the Day of Resurrection say: “We will believe only if God send us some angels or meet us in person.” What an arrogance, what a rebellion.
The Day that they see the angels (it will be too late for them to believe and it) will not be a happy day for them as the doors will be closed to them.
Then I will proceed to tear their (hypocritical good) deeds into scattered floating dust.
Those who are favored to live in the Paradise, will have good news to cheer about as they get established.
On that Day, the sky will break apart and the angels will descend in multitude from the cloud.
The kingdom of that Day belongs to the Most Gracious (as He will put an end to the ruling of other kings.) It will be a very tough Day for those who chose to disbelieve.
On that Day, the unjust will bite his hand and say: “I wish I had followed the path suggested by the Prophet.”
“Pity on me. If I had not taken so and so as a friend!”
“That friend of mine prevented me of worshipping the Lord after I received His Message.” Indeed Satan lets his victim down at the moment that he has promised to help him the most.
At that time the Prophet will say: “My Lord, what a shame that my people deserted this Qur’an.”
Do not worry; I have always appointed enemies for My Prophets from the criminals of the time. Just depend upon your Lord’s guidance and help.
The disbelievers say: “How come the Qur’an is not being revealed to him all at once? It is being revealed gradually in order to strengthen you in belief (so that there will always be a Divine intervention in the process of the establishment of the first Islamic state.)
Thus, as soon as they come up with an objection, I reveal a firm answer.
Those who follow the wrong path, will end up dragged on their faces to the Hell. What an evil destiny.
Recall Moses to whom I gave the Scripture, and strengthened him by his brother Aaron whom I appointed as his helper.
I said to them: “Go to the people who have disregarded My Revelations (as recited to them by Prophet Joseph.)” Eventually, I destroyed them all. What a destruction it was.
As for the people of Noah, I drowned them after having denied their Prophet. I made of them a warning case for mankind (so that they know I am Serious when I say that) I have prepared a painful punishment for the unjust people.
The same thing came true for the people of Ad, Thamood, those who lived in Al-Russ and many other people in between.
For each of them I revealed enough examples and all of them were whipped out completely.
The disbelievers have passed by the towns (of Sodom & Gomorrah) which were ruined by the miserable shower. They see it; yet they do not believe in the Hereafter!
When they see you, they starts mocking at you saying: “Is this the one whom God has appointed as His Messenger?”
They will continue: “He almost succeeded in misleading us. If we had not been perseverant in worshipping our gods, we would have been misled by now!” They will realize who is misled, when they come face to face with their punishment.
Have you noticed the one who (is the prisoner of his own lust and” has taken his ego as his god? Do you think that you can guide such a person?
Do you think that such people can ever listen? They are like the cattle. No they are worse than animals.
Have you not seen how your Lord spreads the shadow? Had He willed, He would have made it constant. But I have decided to make the sun its pilot.
As the sun (the truth) climbs up, the shadow (the disbelief) is drowned to its Lord (for destruction.)
God is the One Who brings the night as a cover for your sleep (a prelude to death) and brings back the day for your resurrection.
He is the One who sends the winds with good omens of His mercy. Then He sends down from the sky pure water.
I do so, in order to raise the dead land into life, and to provide water for all kinds of animals and man that I have created.
Thus, I am distributing the water among you so that you may be thankful. What a shame that most people chose to disregard the Lord’s Mercy.
If I wanted (like Abraham and Lut who were sent to two nearby communities,) I could have sent to every community a Messenger. (However, one sun is enough for the whole land.)
Therefore, do not follow (and compromise with) the disbelievers. Work on them very hard, using this Qur’an as your weapon.
He is the One who merges the two seas; one is fresh and drinkable, while the other is salty and not fit to drink. He has separated them with a formidable barrier ((like Golf Stream which flows for thousands of miles in the ocean without being mixed with it.).
He is the One Who has created man (like any other creature on earth) from water see 24:45.) He has then let him have kin folks by marriage and by blood. God is indeed capable of doing what He wants.
Yet they disbelievers, instead of God, worship the others which can neither harm them nor benefit them! Worse than this, the disbelievers ally with whoever rebels against the Lord (i.e., the Satan!)
Know that I have sent you only as a Warner (about the Hell) and the carrier of good news (about the heaven.)
Say: “I do not ask you for any consulting fee. All I am asking is to let me help you to find the right path to your Lord, in your freedom of choice.”
Put your trust in the Ever Living One Who never dies, and glorify Him in worship. His protection is more than enough for you. He knows everything and is aware of His servants’ sins.
He is the One who created the heavens and the earth, and whatever lies between, in six days. Then He assumed the authority over His realm of creation. He is the Most Gracious. Ask about Him from the One Who is the Most Knowledgeable.
When they are told, “Fall prostrate before the Most Gracious (the same way that all prophets used to worship Him: Matthew 26-I King 18:Numbers 20:6 &Joshua 5:& 7:Genesis 17:3,)” they jokingly say, “What is the Most Gracious? Shall we fall down in prostration because you say so?” Thus, this invitation simply increases their rebellion.
Highly blessed is the One Who has placed the planets in the space and within them He has placed the burning light and shingling moo
He is the One Who makes the nights and the days come one after the another so that man contemplate about it and show some gratitude.
His worshippers are those who walk on earth with the least pride and when they encounter the ignorant people (who want to provoke them) simply wish “Peace” for them.
They are the ones who glorify their Lord in their worship at nights; whether standing up or falling in prostration.
They are the ones who pray: “Lord, save us from the torture of Hell as there is no end in it.”
“What an evil place, what a terrible home.”
They are the ones who are neither extravagant in spending nor stingy. They are capable of balancing it out.
They are the ones who worship none beside the Lord. They never kill anyone (as God has made life sacred) except in the course of justice….
They never commit adultery. Those who commit these sins will receive a double punishment on the Day of Resurrection and will be confined in disgrace.
Exempted are those who sincerely repent, choose to believe, and do good deeds. God will even credit them for their sins (as an eye opening experience that they have gone through;) see how Forgiving and Merciful the Lord is.
Whoever repents and does good deeds, he is sincere in his repentance to God.
The righteous ones are those who say the truth once they are asked to testify. If they encounter vain talks and actions, they pass by it with dignity.
They never react to the recitation of their Lord’s revelations, as if they were deaf and blind.
They are the ones who pray, “Our Lord, let our spouses and children (do good deeds and thus) be a source of joy for us. Please keep us in the forefront of the righteous.”
They are the ones who will be rewarded by being admitted to the highest place in the Paradise in account of their patience. They will be welcomed with due respect, honor, and peaceful greetings and will live therein forever.
What an excellent place to live, what an excellent place to rest.
Say: “You will be noticed by the Lord, only through your worshipping Him. Now that you have chosen the denial, you will soon have your everlasting punishment.”
T.S.M.
Here are the verses of Qur’an which explains religious subjects crystal and clear.
O’ Mohammad, even if you go to the extreme and kill yourself of grief, those who do not want to believe will not believe in the words of God (as mentioned in Qur’an).
If I (God) wanted to make the disbelievers to believe [out of fear], I could have sent them such a terrible sign from the heaven that they would have bowed down being humiliated.
These people will not believe in My Words (as revealed in Qur’an;) they will simply turn aside from it.
As a result of their denial, pretty soon they will witness the reality of what they were mocking at.
Do they not see how many kinds of vegetation I have put on the earth?
Thinking about just this issue will provide them with enough food for thought to prove the existence and the greatness of God. Yet most of them do not care about believing.
Know that your Lord is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
Recall when your lord called upon Moses: “Go to those unjust people.”
“People of Pharaoh who have lost their sensitivity.”
He replied: “My Lord, I am afraid of their denial.”
“I may loose my temper. Besides, I have a problem with my tongue (and I cannot deliver an effective speech.) Would you kindly appoint my brother Aaron as my assistant.”
“Besides, I am still charged with murder there. They may kill me for that.”
The Lord said: “Do not worry, go armed with My miracles. I will be all ears.”
When you see Pharaoh, tell him: “We are the Lord’s Messenger for all His intelligent beings.”
“Lord wants you to send the Israelites in our custody.”
The pharaoh’s response was: “Did we not bring you up among us as a child? Did you not spend so many years of your life with us?”
“Do you remember the crime that you committed. Are you not then one of the ingrates?”
Moses said: “I confess to the crime that I committed when I was an unjust person.”
“Yes, I fled from you out of fear. But now my Lord has granted me the wisdom and has appointed me to His prophet hood.”
“You are rubbing to my face that you did me a favor, and use it as an excuse to keep the Children of Israel in slavery!”
Pharaoh said: “Who is this Lord of all worlds that you are talking about?”
Moses replied: “He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything in between. Do not have the least doubt about this.”
Pharaoh turned to those around him and said in a joking manner “Did you hear this?”
Moses continued: “He is your Lord as well as the Lord of your forefathers.”
Pharaoh said to his companions: “This Messenger which is sent to you is crazy.”
Moses continued his speech: “He is the Lord in the east and the Lord in the west, do you get it?”
Pharaoh continued his chat with people around him: “If by any chance you worship any god beside me, I will throw you in jail.”
Moses said, “What if I come up with an undeniable miracle?”
Pharaoh said, “Go ahead, if you are truthful.”
Moses then threw his staff and it turned into a huge snake.
Then he took his hand out of his pocket, and it radiated an intense light.
Pharaoh turned to his companion and said: “What a magic.”
“His goal is to take your land, through his magical tricks. What do you suggest?”
They said: “Leave him and his brother alone for a while, and send your heralds to every town.
“Let them gather all experienced magicians.”
The magicians came to the meeting place as it was planned.
The people (who were excited about the whole thing) were saying to each other: “Are you going to the meeting too?”
“If the magicians win, we may follow their religion.”
When the magicians arrived, they asked Pharaoh: “Is there any reward for us (and this indicates how serious they were about their own religion.)”
Pharaoh replied: “Not only there will be a great reward, but also a high administrative position in my court will be yours.”
Moses said to them “Go ahead, do your tricks.”
They threw their ropes and sticks, and said: “By the Grace of the Pharaoh’s majesty, we will be the winners.”
Then Moses threw his staff which started to swallow all their tricks.
At this, the magicians fell prostrate.
They said, “We believe in the Lord of all worlds.”
“The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
Pharaoh said: “How dare you to believe in Moses before getting permission from me? Now I see; he is your master and has taught you the art of magic. You will surely find out when I cut your hands and feet on alternate sides. I will crucify you all.”
They replied: “No problem; (as a matter of fact, you are doing us a favor as) we will return to our Lord.
“We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins as we are the first to believe in God and the prophet hood of Moses.”
Eventually, I said to Moses: “Set off with My servants (at night;) you will be pursued.”
Pharaoh sent his heralds to the cities.
They announced the Pharaoh’s declaration: “They are only a small gang.”
“But they have outraged us.”
“We have to stay vigilant”
Subsequently (after having drowned Pharaoh and his army,) I took away from them their gardens and springs.
As well as their treasures and their prestigious positions.
On the other hand, I showered all the children of Israel with such blessings.
Pharaoh’s army pursued them towards the east.
When both parties saw each other, Moses’ people said, “Now we are doomed.”
Moses said, “Not at all. My Lord is with me; He will guide me.”
At that time I said to Moses: “Strike the sea with your staff,” whereupon it parted. Each part was like a great wall.
Thus I delivered them all.
Thus I saved Moses and all those who were with him.
Then I drowned Pharaoh and his troop.
This by itself is a sufficient proof for the disbelievers. What a shame that most people do not join the believers.
Truly, your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.
Now recite the story of Abraham [in this part of the Book.]
Once in a gathering he said to his father and the present people: “What are these things that you worship?”
They replied: “We are totally devoted to these idols that we worship.”
Abraham said, “Can they hear your prayers?”
Then he continued: “Have they ever brought anything good to you? Have they ever punished you?”
They said: “To be honest with you No. But they constitute our cultural routes; we do what we have culturally inherited from our forefathers.”
Abraham asked: “Have you ever opened your eyes to see the absurdity of what you worship?”
“I am the enemy of you and your ancestors’ gods…..
I am devoted only to the Lord of the all worlds:…
the One who created me, and guided me.”
“The One who provides food and water for me.”
“The one that heals me, when I get sick.”
“The One who puts me to death, then brings me back to life.”
“The One who hopefully will forgive my wrongdoings on the Day of Judgment.”
Abraham then prayed: “My Lord, grant me knowledge and wisdom, and gather me among the righteous ones.”
“Make me a role model for the future generations.”
“Please include me among those who will have the pleasure of ending up in the Paradise.”
“May you forgive my father, for following those who are in the darkness.”
“I beg you not to abandon me on the Day of Resurrection:…
the day in which neither money, nor children, is of any help.”
On the Day of Resurrection, only those who have wholeheartedly devoted themselves to the Lord will find the help.
On that Day, Paradise will be presented to the righteous people.
On that Day, the Hell will be opened waiting for the sinners to enter in.
The disbelievers will be asked, “Where are those idols of yours that you used worship instead of God?….
Can they help you now? As a matter of fact, can they help themselves?”
Those idols, along with those who worshipped them, will be thrown therein.
They will be followed by the Satan’s helpers.
Therein they will dispute with one another saying: ..
“By God, we were on absolute darkness.”
“How could we raise you up to the level of the Lord of all worlds?”
“What criminals were those who misled us.”
“Now no one will beg God to have pity on us.”
“We do not even have a single friend.”
“If we were given another chance, we would have chosen the belief.”
The story of Abraham’s life conveys a good lesson. But most people care less.
Your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.
The people of Noah disbelieved in the concept of prophet hood.
Their brother Noah advised them: “Why do you care less?”
“I am a true Messenger of God.”
“Respect the Lord and follow me.”
“I am not charging you any consulting fee. My wage is being paid by the Lord of all worlds.”
“Respect the Lord and follow me.”
They said: “How can we believe you, when only our low lives have joined you?”
Noah replied: “It is not up to me to judge them.”
“Their judgment rests only with my Lord. Do you get it?”
“I will never dismiss those who have chosen to believe (in account of their past or social background.)”
“My only mission is to clearly convey the Lord’s Message.”
They said, “Noah, If you do not stop, we will stone you.”
Noah then turned to God and said: “Lord, my people, thus, has rejected me.”
“Please settle the account between us, and save me and the believers from their wicked intentions.”
Eventually I saved him, and those who had joined him in belief, on board the loaded ark.
While drowning the others.
There is a lesson to be learned from this story; yet most people care less.
The fact is: your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.
Another nation who rejected the prophet hood was Ad.
Their brother Hud said to them: “Why do you not choose righteousness?”
“I am a true Messenger of God.”
“Respect the Lord, and follow me.”
“I do not ask you for any consulting fee; I am already being paid by the Lord of all worlds.”
“On every high ground You build a monument to satisfy your vanity.”
“You build huge palaces to live in as if you are immortal.”
“And when you fight, you do not show any mercy.”
“Respect the Lord and follow me.”
“Respect the One who has taught you all knowledge that you are proud of.”
“The One Who has given you livestock and children.”
“The One Who has given you gardens and springs.”
“I am worried for the punishment of the most awesome Day for you.”
They said: “Do not worry and do not bother yourself preaching to us.”
“The punishment that you are talking about was meant only to our ancestors.” (This attitude is manifested today by the Jews and the Christian who believe that God has promised not to be angry after the Noah’s flood as mentioned in Genesis 9:11.)
“No punishment will ever be imposed upon us.”
They chose to disbelieve and, consequently, I destroyed them as a punishment. This should be a great lesson; yet most people care less.
The fact is: your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.
Thamood also disbelieved in the prophet hood.
Their brother Saleh said to them: “Why do you not choose the righteousness?”
“I am a true Messenger of God.”
“Respect the Lord and follow me.”
“I do not ask for any consulting fee from you; I am already paid by the Lord of all worlds.
“Do you think this blessing is forever?”
“You are enjoying your gardens and springs.”
“You are enjoying the abundance of vegetables and date palms with delicious fruits.”
“You are carving luxurious houses inside the mountains with a great skill.”
“Respect the Lord and follow me.”
“Do not follow the vanities of those who go beyond the limits.”
“Do not follow the mischief makers who never do anything good .”
Their reply was: “You are possessed!”
“You are only a human being like us. come up with a miracle, if you are for real.”
He said: “Here is the camel [with the miraculous nature as you see.] she will drink on given days assigned to her and you will use the water well on the days assigned to you.”
“If you touch her with a bad intention, you will be severely punished on an awesome day.”
Yet they slaughtered her and became regretful….
when they were subjected to their punishment.
The fact is your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.
The people of Lot also rejected the prophet hood of the messengers.
Their brother Lot said to them: “Why do you not choose righteousness?”
“I am a true Prophet of God.”
“Respect the Lord and follow me.”
“I am not asking any consulting fee from you. The Lord of the worlds supports me.
“What is the matter with that, out of all creatures in the world, you are the only one who have adopted homosexuality? (even animals do not do that.)”
“You have disgraced yourselves by marrying men instead of women as approved by your Lord.”
They replied “If you do not stop preaching us, like the preachers before you, we will expel you out .”
He said, “Your behavior is disgusting.”
Then he prayed: “My Lord, save me and my folks from the consequences of their style of life.”
Eventually I saved him and all his folks.
Except that old woman; she was too corrupt.
Then I destroyed the remaining sinners.
I sent them a shower. What a miserable shower. They had already bee warned about it.
This is a great lesson; yet most people care less.
The fact is, your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.
The people of Aiykah (near Midian) also rejected the prophet hood.
Shu‘aib said to them: “Why do you not choose the righteousness?”
“I am a true Messenger of God.”
“Respect the Lord, and follow me.”
“I am not asking for any consulting fee; I am already being paid by the Lord of the worlds.”
“Give full measure when you trade; do not cheat.”
“Weigh with a right scale.”
“Do not cheat the people out of their rights, and do not spread corruption on earth.”
“Fear the One who created you, and those who lived before you.”
Their reply was: “You are possessed.”
“You are just a human being like us. The only difference is, you are a liar!”
“if you are truthful, bombard us with masses from the sky!”
He replied: “My Lord is fully aware of your misdeed, (if He decides, He may grant your wish.)”
Thus they rejected him and, consequently, a Canopy (out of which they were being bombarded, as they has asked for) was sent for their punishment. It was an awesome day, an awesome punishment.
This is a great lesson, yet most people care less.
The fact is, your Lord is the Almighty, Most Merciful.
rest assured that this Qur’an is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
The Trustworthy Spirit (Angel Gabriel) is commissioned to bring it down to you….
in order to make you a Warner.
It is revealed to you In plain Arabic language.
This has been prophesied in the books of previous generations.
Is this not a sufficient proof for those who are being invited to Islam that the learned men of the Children of Israel know it?
If I had sent this Qur’an [in another language (as they wish it would have been sent!)]….
still they would have believed in it.
This is why I render it (like a foreign language) in the hearts of the criminals [so that they do not get it.]
Thus, they cannot believe in it; not until they face their painful punishment which will come to them all of a sudden, ….
when they least expect it.
They will then say: “May we have a second chance?”
They are the ones who challenged Me to punish them (and now, that their wish is granted, they come with another wish!)
As you see, I tolerated them for so many years.
Now it is time that I punish them as I had promises.
Their material possessions did not help them the least.
It is not My style to destroy any nation without sending ample warnings.
This is your warning; do not say that I was unjust.
It is against the nature of the devils to come with guidance like this.
They neither would (because of their evil nature,) nor could (because of their inability to understand the goodness.)
They (like the evil people who become angry when Qur’an is being recited to them) cannot even listen to it (as it hurts them.)
Now, if you do not want to end up with those who will be subjected to the punishment, simply do not worship any other God (in any form and shape such as attachment to the worldly materials, wife, woman, children social status, position at work, the boss, the governor, etc.)
Preach the truth to the people who are closest to you.
Treat the believers who follow you with kindness.
If they rebel, say: “I am not responsible for what you do.”
Put your trust in the Almighty, Most Merciful.
He sees you when you worship Him at night.
He sees you when you worship Him falling in prostration.
God hears everything and knows everything.
Do you want to know upon whom the devils descend?
They descend upon every sinner who fabricates lies (fortune tellers, those who falsify the word of God, those who lie, and those who disobey the Lord’s commandments.)
Such people whisper hearsay into ears, but most of them are liars.
As for the poets (and the artists who visit our houses constantly with their enchanting works,) they enchant only those who reject God pleasing moral standards.
Do you not see that their opinion changes according to the situation?
Actually, they preach what they do not do!
Only those artists are saved who choose to believe, do good deeds, mentions the Lord frequently and use justice as their criterion in their fights. As for the wrongdoers, pretty soon they will come to know the punishment which awaits them
T.S. You are hereby listening to the words of God Who clearly answers those questions of yours that no one else can answer (Where we are coming from? What is the meaning of life? What will happen to us after death? Etc.) in this Qur’an.
This Qur’an will guide the believers through their life and contains good news for them.
The believers are those who worship God on regular basis and devote a portion of their incomes/ resources to charity and believe that there is a life after death [and that this earthly life is a short prelude to an everlasting life].
As far as those who do not believe in hereafter, I (God) have doomed them to be pleased with their materialistic beliefs and wonder around like blind people.
For them there is an awful punishment in reserve and they are among the losers in the Hereafter.
Mohammad, indeed you are receiving these verses from the Lord Whose is the Wisest and Knows Everything.
Once, out in the desert, Moses saw the flames of a fire afar. He said to his folk: “Wait for me so that I go and see what it is all about and perhaps bring some fire to warm you up.” 
When he reached there, he heard a voice coming from the fire and surroundings: “Glory to the Lord of the universe.”
“O’ Moses, I am God, the Almighty, and the Most Wise.”
“Throw down your staff.” When Moses saw that his staff turned into a moving snake, he turned and ran, out of fear, without even looking back. [Then he heard:] “ O' Moses do not be afraid; my prophets should not fear.”
“Only those fear who have done wrong. Even the latter; if they change, they will be forgiven as I am All-Forgiving, All-Merciful.”
“Now put your hand into your pocket; when you take it out, it will shine white [like an intense fire] without hurting you. These are among the nine miracles that you have to present to Pharaoh and his people; [you are my messengers to them and your mission is to bring them back to the right path as] they are indeed wicked people.”
[What a shame that when] Moses presented My undeniable miracles they simply said: “These are nothing but plain magic.”
They rejected them only out of arrogance as [anytime a plague was sent to them, they begged Moses to remove it as] they were convinced. They were unjust to their own soul and see what happened to them.
As to David and Solomon, I granted them the knowledge as a gift. They both were grateful and said: “Thank to the Lord Who treated us better than the most of his believing servants.”
When Solomon inherited David’s kingdom, he said [to his people]: “God has taught me to communicate with the birds and has granted me many talents & knowledge out of his grace [that I am sincerely grateful for.]
Solomon had formed a disciplined army of men, Extra-terrestrials (Jinns) and birds ready to carry his orders.
In a military campaign, Solomon and his army entered into a valley where the ants were freely roaming. One of the ants said: “Hurry up, get out of Solomon’s way as his army will unknowingly crush us all.”
Solomon was amused with the ant’s speech and smiled. He then [thanked God for giving him all this knowledge and wealth and] said: “ O My lord, I thank you for all favors that you have showered me and my parents with. Help me to do nothing but the good deeds to please you. May you include me out of your mercy among your righteous servants.”
Once he summoned all birds in his army. When he took the attendance, he realized that the Hoopoe was absent.
[Solomon became angry at his absence and said:] “If he does not come up with a good excuse, I will punish him severely or even execute him.”
It did not take a long when Hoopoe arrived saying: “I have been to the land of Sheba and you do not know what is going on there.”
“There is a mighty woman ruling them and they are showered with many blessings.”
“They are worshipping the sun instead of God. The Devil has made their deeds so pleasing to them that they think they are always right. They are therefore deprived of any guidance [God does not guide those who have gone so far in wrongdoing.]
They should have been prostrating before God; the One Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth; the One Who knows whatever man reveals or keeps as a secret.
There is no God but the One Who is the Owner of the glorious Throne.
Solomon said: “We will see whether you are telling the truth or simply fabricating a story.”
“Take this letter of mine and hand it over to them. Wait for their response and bring it back to me.”
After having received the letter, the] Queen said to her advisors: “I have received an important letter.”
“It is from Solomon saying: “In the name of God, the Most Forgiving, and the Most Merciful.”
“Leave the arrogance aside and come to me as Submitters (Muslims) to the Lord.”
She said: “Advise me in this affair as I have never done anything without your consultation.”
They replied: “We are powerful and know the fighting skills. The final decision is yours.”
She said: “When the kings invade a town, they usually destroy it and undignified their citizens.”
“Let me send him some gift and see what his response will be.”
When the messengers presented the gifts, Solomon said: “Do you want to buy me with this world’s wealth? Don’t you know that what God has given me is much better than the wealth that you are impressed with?”
“Go back and let them know that we [the worshippers of God] will come to destroy the [the worshippers of sun] with such a mighty army that they can not resist.”
Solomon then turned to his court’s people and asked: “Who can bring her throne to me so that they [realize my power and] come to me in submission?”
A Jin (Extra-terrestrial) of his court said: “I can bring it to you before you even stand up. Trust me, I am powerful enough to do so.”
A scientist of his court said: “I can beam it here in a blink of an eye. When Solomon saw her throne placed in front of him, he thanked the Lord saying: “This is by the Grace of my Lord, whereby He wants to see whether I appreciate all these blessings of Him or I am an ungrateful person. The one who is grateful is good to his own soul. The one who is ungrateful should know that God does not need his thanking; indeed God is the wealthiest and the Most Generous.
Solomon then ordered to build a palace to accommodate the Queen at her arrival and said: “Let us see whether she will submit to God or will remain defiant.”
When the Queen arrived, Solomon asked: “Does this [throne] look like yours?” She said: “It is just the same.” I had already known this [that Solomon is a Prophet of God and not a simple king] and had tendency to surrender myself [to the will of God and became a believer.]
She was [not a stubborn person and she was] worshipping other deities in account of her [upbringing and] being among the unbelieving people.
Solomon then invited her to enter to her palace. When she saw the interior, she thought it was a pool of water; so she tucked up her skirt to enter it. Solomon said: “It is [not water but is] paved with crystals. This last strike [removed any remaining doubt from her heart and] made her to say: “ O My Lord, I have been unjust to myself; now I join to Solomon in submitting myself to the Lord of the universe.”
As to Thamood, I (God) appointed their brother Saleh as my Prophet to invite them to worship the Lord. Instead [ of being united under the flag of the Lord and find peace,] they turned into two fighting groups.
Saleh said: “ My people, why do you rush into committing sins instead of doing good deeds? Repent and ask God for forgiveness; may He have mercy on you.
They said: “You are a bad omen [for the simple reason that we were one nation at “peace” before you.] Saleh replied: “This [bad or good] omen [that you are talking about] is a mean by which God has put you in trial.
They were nine wicked men in town who had done nothing good in their lives.
They got together and said: “Let us kill Saleh and his followers and then deny the whole thing. However, we have to swear to God that this will remain a secret of ours.”
They had their own plot and God had His own scheme of which they were unaware
Note the result of their scheme. I destroyed them and their people together.
There their houses lie desolate in account of their meanness. There is a lesson in this for the knowledgeable people.
Of course I saved those who had believed and respected the Lord.
Prophet] Lot said to his people: “How can you commit such an abomination publicly while you know that it is wrong?”
What kind of people you are that prefers men to women for the gratification of your sexual desires? What a foolish people you are [unaware of punishment in reserve for you.]
The only response that he received from his people was: “Expel this pious looking Lot and his family from your town.”
At last I saved Lot and his family, except his wife who had already been doomed.
Then I ordered an unusual rain to take over them. What a miserable rain for the people who were well warned in advance.
now that you are blessed with a “God pleasing” way of life,] Say: “Thank God and peace be with His chooses servants.” [Then ask:] “Is God better or those whom you worship beside God?”
Who has created the heavens and the earth? Who is sending the water from the sky in order to bring to life those beautiful gardens of yours? Who else but God can create any of those trees? Is there any other god beside God? The fact of the matter is, the disbelievers have chosen the wrong direction.
Who has made the earth habitable for you? Who has made the water run for you in the rivers? Whose has set the mountains on the earth? Who is preventing the two running water [like so many rivers which are running in the oceans] from mixing together? Is there any other god beside God? What a shame that most people do not get it.
Who is the One Who answers your prayers when you are absolutely desperate and relieves your suffering? Who has made you superior to the other creatures on earth? is there any other god beside God? What a shame that only a few people reflect about these things.
Who is the One Who guides you [by organizing the stars in a nonchaotic order as well as magnetic field of the earth in a predictable order] through the darkness of the land and the sea? Who is the One Who sends you the winds to give you the good news of forthcoming rain [that your life depends upon so much] as a practical proof of His Mercy? Is there any other god beside God? God is much higher in rank than the others (idols, women, wealth, power, etc.) that people worship.
Who is the One Who initiates the creation at first place and then makes the reproduction of life possible? Who is the One Who sends your means of living from the sky as well as from the earth? Is there any other god beside God? If so, bring your proof or explain it by an argument to show your sincerity in your belief.
[O' Muhammad] Say: “None but God has knowledge about unknown territories; they do not [even] know when they will be raised [for the judgment.]”
As a matter of fact, they are confused, doubt and are blind (and totally careless) about Hereafter.
The disbelievers [jokingly] say: “After having turned into the dust, we and our forefathers will be raised.”
“We are told these [none senses] in the past. These are nothing but mythology type of stories.”
In response, tell them: “Roam the earth and see [with your own eyes] what happened to the unbelievers before you.”
[O’ Mohammad,] Do not feel sorry for them and do not worry about their threatening plans.
They say: “If you tell the truth, let the Day of Resurrection take place today [so that we see it with our own eyes and then believe in it.]”
Say: “You are already [being judged and partially] paying for some of your sins due to your challenge.”
Indeed your Lord is full of Grace towards the people [by postponing the day of judgment for them and giving them more time to improve themselves.] What a shame that most of them are not grateful.
Your Lord knows what people say and what they mean.
There is not a secret thing in the heavens and on the earth which is not recorded [for/by God.]
This Qur’an settles the issues that have divided the children of Israel [Jews and Christians alike] into different groups.
This Qur’an is [,therefore,] a mercy and a guidance for the believers.
Your Lord will judge among them by His own criteria; your Lord is the Highest Authority and the Most Knowledgeable.
Put your trust in God as you are following the most obvious truth.
You can not deliver the message to the dead person nor can you make the deaf to hear you; especially when they turn away from you.
You can not guide the blind [to the right path] in spite of his will. You can deliver the message only to those who have chosen to believe and then submit themselves wholeheartedly.
When the time comes, I (God) will order an earthly beast to give them a speech about their disbelief.
Imagine the Day when I will gather together the disbelievers of every community.
When they are all gathered, then I will say: “You refused my revelations without giving them any thought. Is it not what you did?”
Then they will be sentenced for their wickedness while unable to speak.
Have they not seen how I have created the night for their rest and the day for their activities. This alone is a proof enough for the believers.
When the Day of Resurrection is announced by the horn, everyone in the heavens and the earth will be horrified, except those who have pleased God. All will present themselves to Him in submission.
When you look at the mountains, you find them standing still. They are moving, however, like the clouds. This is the manifestation of the Lord’s manufacturing power That has created everything in perfection. This Powerful Lord knows anything that you do.
Those who come with good deed to their Lord, will be rewarded many times and have not to fear on the Day of Judgment.
Those who have done evil things, should expect to be flung upon their faces into the fire. Do you not expect to be rewarded according to what you have done?
[O’ Mohammad, say:] “I am commanded to worship the Lord of this City (Mecca) which the One Who owns everything has made a sanctuary. I am commanded to submit to Him (to be a Muslim) and to recite Qur’an.”…
The one who accepts the guidance dose it for his own good. As to the one who prefers to stay lost, say: “I am only a Warner (the choice is yours).”
Let them know that: "Praise is to Lord. He will soon show you His signs which you will recognize; your Lord is not unaware of what you do."
T.S.M.
These are the words of God which constitute Qur’an [A book which clearly explain that part of the unseen which is related to the man’s earthly life.]
I (God) am going to recite to you believers a little bit of the true story of Moses and Pharaoh.
Pharaoh established his tyranny in Egypt by dividing men (based upon their race and nationality of origin). Then He humiliated one group (the Jews) by killing their sons and submitting their females to the slavery; indeed he was a great sinner and criminal.
Meanwhile, I (God) decided to change the situation and raise the oppressed ones to become the rulers and inherit the wealth and power.
And to humiliate the Pharaoh and Haman (Pharaoh’s right hand side) and his “elite” group: This was exactly what they were really afraid of happening to them and the basis for their tyranny.
[When Pharaoh Ordered to kill all new born male Israelites,] I pacified her by saying: “Calm down and feed your baby. When you feel the danger is eminent, [put him in a basket] and cast him into the river. Do not fear and do not worry as I will bring him back to you and appoint him as one of my Prophets.
[What an irony that] the Pharaoh’s own household had to pick Moses up, so that he may become their enemy and create head ache for them. Indeed Pharaoh and Haman and their troops were misguided [thinking that by killing all new born males, they can change God’s will.]
[When Moses was picked up from the river,] Pharaoh’s wife [and not his daughter as mentioned in the Scriptures] said: “Do not kill this cute little thing as he may be a good omen and we may later even adopt him as our son [so that he never turns against us.] They did not know what the future has for them.”
Meanwhile Moses’ mother was going through such anxiety that she would have given away the baby’s identity, if I (God) had not cast peace on her to be a believer [in God’s promises.]
She told her daughter to follow the baby from afar without being noticed [to see where he will end up.]
I had already made Moses not to accept milk from any nursing mother. His sister [either working as a maid in the court or her path crossing by] said: “May I show you a family that can take a good care of the baby and raise him for you?”
Thus I returned Moses back to his mother [with the economic and prestigious backing of the Pharaoh] to calm her down, remove her worries and prove to her that: “God never reneges His Promise” but most people are not aware of this fact.
When Moses became mature and full-grown, I gave him knowledge and a sound sense of judgment; I always treat the righteous ones like this.
One day, when it was all quiet in the city, and Moses was walking leisurely, he saw that two men are fighting: one of his own people and the other of his enemies. The man of his own people asked for help. As Moses through a punch, the other man was knocked down to death. Moses said: “This is indeed an act of Satan; he is man’s declared enemy and a misleader.”
Moses then turned to God saying: “O my Lord, I have done an injustice to my soul and implore your forgiveness.” God then forgave him [and did not let anyone to witness the incident] as He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
Moses then in his prayer said: “In response to Your favor, I will never support the criminals.”
The next morning, still under the shock of the incidence, he saw that the same man is engaged in another fight and is asking for his help. Moses replied: “You are certainly a misguided man [always engaged in a new fight.]
As Moses was ready to intervene and help the Hebrew man, the latter [misunderstood the remark of Moses and thought that Moses is going to beat him so he] cried out: “O Moses, do you want to kill me today the same way that you killed the other one yesterday? You are indeed stepping toward becoming a tyrant rather than a righteous person.”
Later Moses saw a man running to him saying: “The chiefs are holding a session to pass a death sentence on you; leave immediately as I am your well-wisher.”
Moses then fled the town in fear and prayed: “O Lord save me from these wicked people.”
Flying off toward Midyan, he was praying: “O Lord put me on the right track.”
When Moses reached the well of Midyan, he saw all shepherds are watering their animals except two women who are [sadly] waiting. Moses asked them: “What is the problem?” They replied: “ As our father is an old man, we have to wait so that the others water their animals first.”
Moses then stepped in and helped them to water their animals. Then he retired to a shady place to relax and said: “O my Lord, this poor creature of yours will appreciate any provision that you send down to him.”
Pretty soon one of those two women shyly approached him and said: “My father invites you to meet him as he wants to pay your for your intervention.” When Moses met with the father and told him his whole story, the father said: “Do not worry as you are now out of the reach of those wicked people.”
One of those two women said: “Father, hire this man as he is strong and trustworthy.”
The father said: “I would like to offer the hand of one of my daughters in marriage to you. In return, I expect you to work for me at least eight years. I will appreciate your working for me for ten years, but I do not want to make this matter too difficult for you. God willing, in due time, you will find me a righteous man.”
Moses replied: “Let us call it an agreement between you and me. When I finish eight or ten years of services to you, it will not be just from you to ask for more as God is witness for our agreement.”
When Moses completed his obligation, he left Midyan with his family. During his travel, he saw a fire in the slope of Mount Sinai. He said to his family: “Wait here so that I may bring you a little bit of that fire so that we may start a bonfire to warm us up.”
When Moses reached there, he heard a voice from the right side of that blessed [by the Devine light] valley: “Moses, I am God, Lord of the universe.”
[He was then commanded:] “Throw down your staff.” When Moses saw that his staff started to move like a snake, he was overwhelmed by fear and started to run. [Then he heard:] “Come back Moses and have no fear; you are perfectly safe.”
“Put your hand into your pocket; when you take it out of your pocket, you will find it shining without burning you. This practice will deliver you from any fear. These are two miracles that you will show to Pharaoh and his people; they have become very wicked.”
Moses said: “My Lord, I have killed one of their people, I am afraid of being slaughtered by them.”
[Then he continued:] “As my brother Aaron is a better speaker than me, send him as my helper to deliver the message as I am afraid to be ridiculed.”
The Lord replied: “I will send your brother with you so that you feel stronger. I will give you both such a powerful image that no one will dare to harm you. With my miracles, you and your followers will have the final victory.
When Moses came to them with My undeniable miracles, they said: “These performances are nothing but illusive magic; we have never heard such none senses [the oneness of God, Day of Judgment, Heaven and Hell, etc.] from our forefathers.
Moses told them: “My Lord knows what kind of a person I am that He has sent me to you as His Messenger [I am not a magician]. God knows very well who will be victorious in the end. The fact of the matter is, the wicked ones never succeed.”
Then Pharaoh turned to his chief administrators and said: “I am your only god. You Hamaan, make me the tallest tower so that I climb up and see this God that Moses is talking about. I am sure that he has fabricated all these stories.”
Thus Pharaoh and his troops continued to be arrogant without any right or justification; they never dreamt to stand up in front of Me for Judgment.
Therefore, I punished him and his army by drowning them all in the sea. Note the fate of the wicked people.
They have set a precedent for injustice so that whoever walks on their path goes to Hell. Surely no one will show up to help them on the Day of Judgment.
They tasted a part of their punishment in this world and will be the most miserable in the Day of Resurrection.
After having destroyed the wicked ones, I revealed the Book to Moses as a source of enlightenment, guidance and a sign of My mercy to the people so that they may learn priceless lessons from it.
You (Mohammad) were not present in the Western edge of the Mount Sinai and were not witnessing these event when I issued My commandments to Moses [these passages are not, therefore, your words and are the revelations of your Lord.]
Since then I have willed that many generations come and go and a long time has passed by [necessitating a new Prophet to guide people who have been deviated from the right path in account of the passage of time.] You were also not present in Midyan so that you may recite our revelations to them. Your only source of information [about all these events] is My revelations.
You were also not present in that side of the Mount Sinai that I called Moses [for the first time.] All these revealed to you is a part of My mercy to these people to whom a guide is not sent for the longest time. May they learn [priceless] lessons from it.
Now if, in account of their own deeds, a misfortune strikes the people, they will not have an excuse to say: “Our Lord, If you had sent a Prophet to us, we would have certainly had followed Your Revelations and would have been among the believers.”
However, when My revelation [which is the only thing that they needed for guidance] reached these people, they said: “How come Mohammad has not been given the same [miracles] which was given to Moses?” Did people like them not deny the miracles of Moses? Did they not refer to those miracles as work of two magicians? Did they not say: “We will not believe any way?”
Tell them: “If you have a better revelation from the Lord, than Qur’an and Torah, containing better guidance, let me know. I will follow such book to the point with you, if you are sincere.
If they fail to answer, then know that they are simply following their own opinions [which justify their lust] and who is more unjust [to himself] than an opinionated person who rejects the Highest Authority’s guidance. God definitely will not guide the unjust people for the simple reason that they do not deserve it.]
I have [been more than just and have] delivered the message to them [over and over again] so that they may have the [ultimate] guidance.
Those who have received the previous scriptures will believe in this Qur’an. [As a matter of fact, the teachings of Qur’an are the same of the previous scriptures, before being tampered with.]
Whenever Qur’an is recited to the latter [and not many of them have ever heard the verses of Qur’an], they say: “We believe in it as it has been revealed by God. In fact we have been Muslims from the very beginning.”
These reverts will be rewarded twice (as much as Muslims) for the simple reason that they have [shown lots of courage in accepting the risk of loosing their family, friends and people for the sake of the truth and have] shown patience, responded to the evil with goodness and devoted a part of their [God given] income to charity.
When they hear any vain talk, they leave that place saying: “We are responsible for our deeds and you are responsible for yours. May peace be with you; we are not interested in talks based upon the ignorance.”
O’ Mohammad, you cannot guide those whom you like to see guided. Only God can guide whoever He pleases. He knows who [has the capacity of absorbing the truth and deserves to be guided and] will accept guidance.
They say: “If we follow this guidance, we will become the subject of the persecution [of other Arab tribes who have placed their gods in Mecca.] Do they not realize that it is I who made this city a safe place for them at first place and it is I who provided different kind of fruits for their enjoyment; what a shame that most of them they do not get it.
So many “safe” places I have destroyed in account of their inhabitants’ attitude when they became proud of their flourishing economy and turned into wicked. Visit their ruins; only a few of them are still inhabited. At last it is God who inherited the land [that He had given out of mercy to those ungrateful people.]
Your Lord never destroys any civilization before having sent a prophet among them to relay His Message. I would never punish any community unless its people practice injustice.
Whatever you have been given is a knickknack and only a provision so that you go through this worldly life. What is with God [in reserve for the successful ones] is much more valuable and everlasting. Why do you not use common sense [and give up your Hereafter for a few days of this worldly life?]
Is the person to whom I have promised (and there is no doubt that God delivers) good rewards in Hereafter equal to the one who has been given everything in this world but will be presented on the Day of Resurrection for punishment?
Do not forget the Day that your Lord will ask: “Where arethose whom you were used to worship beside Me?”
Those who had introduced alternative ideologies [and were literally taken to the Heaven by their followers] would speak up and confess: “Our Lord, we misled them [with our opinionated thoughts] for the simple reason that we were misled ourselves. Now [that we know the truth,] we throw ourselves at Your mercy; our fans did not literally worship us.”
Then it will be said : “Now call upon those whom you literally worshipped.” The idol worshippers would call their idols but will get no response; then they will face their punishment. If they had only followed My guidance.
Let them not forget the Day that they will be asked: “What was your response to my Prophet’s invitation?”
They will be so stunned by the events that they will be speechless.
As to the one who realized his mistakes, chose the belief, asked sincerely for forgiveness and devoted himself to good deeds, he may have hope to be included among the true successful ones.
Your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses [whoever He desires for a given task to be performed anywhere in the universe.] The choice takes place at the Lord’s discretion [therefore, if a creature is chosen as an Angel, Prophet, etc., he should not be worshipped as his high rank is given to him by God and not earned by himself.] Glory belongs only to God, the Most High. He is far above needing a partner, as the idol worshipers think.
Your Lord knows what the disbelievers keep in their hearts (as secret) and what they reveal (as lies and hypocrisies.)
God is the One beside whom there is no other god. To God [and only to God and not to other creature of God] belongs all praise both in this world and in the Hereafter. Only God is capable of a sound Judgment and to Him you will all return (for judgment.)
Say to the disbelievers: “What if God decides to make the night perpetual (either by ordering the earth not to turn around its axle or by spreading volcanic ashes in the atmosphere, or...) till the Day of Resurrection, which one of those whom you are worshiping, except God, can return the light back to you. Do you not hear anything?
Say to the disbelievers: “What if God (on the contrary) made the day perpetual (till the Day of Resurrection), which “god” of yours, except God, can bring the night back to you so that you may have a peaceful rest again? Do you not see anything?
The creation of the day and the night [caused by the earth’s spinning around its axle] is a Mercy of God (as without it the earth would not have been hospitable for mankind) so that you may settle down on earth, take advantage of the provision that God has provided for you and may be thankful.
The Day [will come when they have to feel the shame] when God will ask them: “Where are those associates of Mine that you fabricated [and worshipped ?]
On that Day, a representative of each nation will be asked: “Present your excuses for your behavior.” They will then realize how wrong they have been and their fabrications will disappear forever.
Those who are after nothing but gathering the wealth are reminded of the story of] Korah who was of the people of Moses. He became arrogant (and stingy) and rebelled against his Lord’s commandments (generosity, charity, decency, etc.) I (God) had given him so many treasures that their very keys were almost too heavy for a band of strong men. His people advised him: “Do not be so arrogant; God does not like the arrogant people.”
Then they said: “Use your wealth, which is given to you by God at first place, as a mean to please God and secure your life in Hereafter without neglecting your fair share of this world. Be good to the others as God has been good to you and do not spread corruption on earth as God does not like the corrupt people.”
Korah’s response was: “I have earned my wealth by using my brain!” Did he [who was so proud of his knowledge] not know that God [was the one who multiplied and safeguarded his wealth for him for the simple reason that God] had destroyed many wealthier and stronger than him in the past? The guilty ones, however, are judged according to the law [and not according to their own criteria.]
One day Korah appeared in public with all his fineries. Those who were following the worldly goals said: “What a lucky man; it would be nice to have such wealth.”
Those who were knowledgeable said: “Shame on you; God’s blessing is far superior than your wealth and only those who choose to believe, do good deeds and are patient will earn it.”
Eventually I punished him, his followers and all his wealth by sinking them underground. Neither him nor any force could have helped him against God; he turned to be a looser.
The same people who were envious of him the day before, were shameful of their thoughts and said: “What a shame that we had forgotten that it is God who gives so much to some people and so little to the others [in order to try them in wealth and in poverty.] How graceful of God not have sunk us with him. Shame on us that we forgot that the disbelievers never succeed.”
I (God) have reserved the Paradise for those who do not seek domination in the earth nor get involved in corruption; the successful ones are those who are constantly minding their Lord.
The one who does a good deed will receive many folded rewards for it. The one who does a wrong thing, he will receive a punishment equal to his sin [and not an excessive punishment.]
Rest assured that the One (God) Who has formally established this Qur’an (set of laws and code of conducts) upon you, will summon you to His Court. Therefore, say to people: “God knows who is following the Lord’s path and who is lost.”
You never expected to receive this Book (absolute criteria to establish right and wrong.) The revelation of Qur’an is a favor of God (otherwise , like elected representative of the secular government who consult among themselves day and night to establish a “right” code of conduct and a “just” set of laws- and of course the next day change their own established laws and come with a “better” one!) Therefore, do not side with those who reject My laws (and try to establish their own civil laws.)
Never let yourself being talked into abandoning the Lord’s revelations; invite people to seek the pleasure of God and do not follow those who worship others beside God.
Do not worship but God. There is no holiness butt God. Everything will perish but God. God has absolute power over everything and to Him will all of you return.
A.L.M.
Do people think that by saying “I believe”, they will be considered as believers without going though any test of hardship? [Actually, those who submit themselves to the torture and do not deny their beliefs are the true believer]
The believers before them were subjected to the hardship to pass the test in spite of the fact that God knew in advance which one of them was a true believer (and which one pretending to be a believer.)
As far as the mischief makers are concerned, do they really think that they will escape God’s punishment?
Whoever is looking forward to meet his Lord, will meet Him [sooner than he thinks] in a day which is pre-determined by God. Indeed God [before Whom you appear for the judgment is not uninformed. He] is the One Who Hears and Who Knows everything.
Whoever strives for the betterment of himself, does it for his own good. God is not in need of any of His creatures.
I will cover the sins of those who believe and lead a righteous life and reward them generously for their good deeds.
I have commanded the mankind to be kind toward his parents. However, you should not obey them, if they ask you to worship others beside Me. Know that you will all return to me and then I will inform you of what you have been doing [in your worldly life.]
As to those who [chose] to believe and do good things, I will include them among the righteous ones.
There are some people who say: “We have believed in God”. However, when they face the difficulties in establishing the Lord’s kingdom on earth, they consider their persecution as the “punishment of God!” When the victory comes [after the hardship], they say: “We were with you!” Do they not know that God is fully aware of what is in the hearts of the people?
God has to know [and prove to man through the trials of life] who is a believer and who is a hypocrite.
The disbelievers say to the believers: “Follow our way of life and do not worry; [if there should be such thing as the Day of the Judgment,] We will accept the responsibility for your sins.” Know that they are the liars and [when the Day of the Judgment comes] they will not bear the burden of nobody’s sin.
They will certainly carry their own sins, as well as the sins of the others whom they were responsible for. On the Day of the Judgment, they also have to answer why they were spreading false rumors.
I (God) chose Noah as a Prophet to his people. He tried for years [to invite his people to the right path without any significant success.] In account of their wickedness, they were doomed to the [great] flood.
I saved him and those who joined him in the Ark as an example [of the mercy of God toward the believers and His anger toward the disbelievers] for the people of the worlds.
As to Abraham, he said to his people: “Worship God and respect Him the most. I wish you knew how good following the Lord is for you.”
“Those that you are worshipping instead of God, are powerless idols. You have fabricated a big lie [by deifying your idols.] Your idols are not capable of providing your livelihood. seek your provision only from the Lord, worship Him, be thankful to Him and remember that you will return back to Him.
The only mission of Mohammad is to deliver the message; you have the choice of disregarding the message [being fully aware of its consequences] as many nations before you chose to deny the message of the Lord.
Have the disbelievers not seen how God originates the creation and then let it reproduce itself. [The fact that the continuation of life is successfully in place proves that] this is easy for God.
Ask them to travel on earth and study how God initiated the creation. The same God who initiated life is capable of recreating life [we know today that it is possible to recreate a being from the smallest part of his body, i.e., his D.N.A.]
God may punish whoever (among those who deserve to be punished) He wills and shower His mercy upon whoever (who has turned to Him sincerely) He wills and eventually everyone will return to Him.
There is no place on earth or the heavens that you can escape the Lord’s grasp; you have none beside God as a Lord and Master.
Those who choose to disregard their Lord’s commands and disbelieve in meeting Him [on the Day of their resurrection] have deprived themselves of My mercy and have subjected themselves to a painful punishment.
The only response of the disbelievers to the invitation of Abraham was: “Kill him/ burn him.” Then God made him walk out of the fire [that the disbelievers had cast him into] so that the believers learn a lesson from this incidence [that God never leaves his sincere worshippers alone and will give them the final victory.]
Abraham then [delivered a fiery speech and] said: “When you see the Hellfire, you will curse the same idols that you have created and are worshipping in this world. But [it will be too late as] you will end up in the Fire and there will be none to help you.
Then Lot [who was chosen to become a prophet later] stepped out and declared his belief. Then he [Lot or Abraham] said: “I am emigrating toward my Lord who is the Greatest and the Most Wise.”
[In response to Abraham’s bravery and sincerity,] I granted him Isaac [as one of his sons] and Jacob [his grand son]. I also assigned prophet hood to his descendents and gave them the scriptures. Abraham got his fair reward in this world and will be among the righteous ones in the Hereafter.
As to Lot, he [delivered a sermon to his people and] said: “You are engaged in a shameful sin [sodomy] that no one in the world has ever committed before you.”
“[What is wrong with you that] you practice homosexuality, robbery and all kind of indecencies in your assemblies [an orgy of sins.]” They jokingly responded: “If you are truthful [and if there is such thing as God], then let us taste His punishment!”
Lot then prayed: “My lord, grant me victory over these wicked people.”
[In response to the Lot’s prayer,] God sent His messengers [passing through Abraham’s land] giving Abraham the good news [of the birth of Prophet Isaac as well as the prophet hood of Isaac’s unborn son, i.e., Jacob] saying: “We are in our way to destroy those people [of Sodom] who have gone too far in wickedness.
Abraham said: “But Lot is living there!” They said: “We definitely know who lives there; we will save him and his household except his wife who has chosen to join the disbelievers.”
When My messengers arrived at Lot’s place, he became embarrassed [as his people wanted to molest them.] They said: “ Have no fear and do not worry. We are going to save you and your household except your wife who should stay [and be punished] with the wicked ones.”
“We are in charge of pouring disaster upon these wicked people from the sky in account of their evil deeds.”
I have left the ruins of their cities to serve as a lesson for those people who use their brains.
As to the people of Midyan, I relayed My messages through their brothers Shu’aib. He said: “My people, worship none but God, keep in mind that there is a Day of Judgment [that you have to meet your Lord] and do not go too far in wickedness.
They chose to disregard the message. Consequently I sent them a sever earthquake and by the morning they were all dead in their habitats.
Equally, as you have visited their ruins, the wicked people of Ad and Thamud were destroyed. The Satan made their deeds pleasing in their eyes and misled them from the right path, and this in spite of the fact that they were sensible people.
I also destroyed [the devilish triangle of the power of] Pharaoh, Korah and Haman. [Out of mercy and fairness] I sent Moses to them with undeniable miracles, but they were too arrogant to hear the message. Their [false] power could not save them from God’s punishment.
All the above mentioned wicked people tasted the result of their wrongdoings. To some [people of Ad] I sent a wind to rain the stones on them, against some [to the people of Thamud] I sent the earthquake, some [like Korah] were sank underground and some [like Pharaoh and Haman] were drowned. God was not [as today’s disbelievers claim] unjust to them; they themselves chose to betray their own souls.
Those who choose beside God as their protector, resemble to the spider who, as everyone knows, build the least strong house to live in. Would that these people had knowledge [and knew how they are betraying their own souls!]
God certainly knows whom these people worship as He is the Almighty, and the Most Wise.
I (God) cite these examples to make the people wake up; but only those who have [earned the faculty of] knowledge understands them.
God has created the heavens and the earth with the truth [the realm of creation is based upon such precise principles that the laws of physics equally apply to any part of the universe.] Only those people understand this [lack of chaos] who are equipped with knowledge.
Recite whatever is revealed to you from the book and worship your Lord on regular basis. The one who glorifies the Lord through regular acts of adoration will hardly fall into the pitfall of sins and indecencies; Indeed God’s remembrance of you has a greater magnitude [than your remembrance of Him. God has mentioned in the Qur’an: “Remember me and I will remember you.”] Keep in mind that God knows whatever you are doing.
Do not engage in a senseless dispute with the people of the hood except in the best [civilized and rational] manner. Do not dispute with the wicked among them and say: “We believe in God’s revelations which are sent to us and to you. Our God, which is the same as yours, is one [without any partner] and we are submitters [in Arabic Muslim] to Him.
I have revealed this Qur’an to you (Mohammad) so that those who are blessed with the previous Scriptures [recognize its purity through a comparative study with their own Scriptures] and believe in it as so many [truth loving] people choose to believe in it. None but the sick ones will deny My Revelations.
[The disbelievers say that Mohammad has forged this Qur’an.] You (Mohammad) never read any book before Qur’an, neither have you authored any book so far [Mohammad’s people knew that he was illiterate.] If you had done so, the disbelievers would have had a reason to doubt [your sincerity.]
These revelations, indeed penetrate into the heart of those who possessed knowledge. Only those who betray their souls will disregard My Revelations.
They say: “Why this man (Mohammad0 does not produce any miracle?” Say: “It is only God Who produces the miracles; [I cannot make a miracle of my own,] My only mission is to relay God’s message to you.”
Is this book (which I have revealed to you and you recite it to them) not enough of a miracle? In this Qur’an [which is the biggest miracle], those who believe will find the mercy of the Lord and [the most valuable] admonitions.
Say: “I take God as witness [that I have relayed the Lord’s message.] God, who has absolute knowledge over whatever is in the heavens and the earth, hereby declares that those who believe in others beside God and that deny the Lord is the [real] losers.”
They make a joke of the Hereafter’s punishment and ask you to bring it upon them sooner. They will face their punishment at a pre-determined time. It will happen to them suddenly when they least expect it.
The disbelievers challenge you to accelerate their punishment; they do not know that the Hell has already encircle them.
When they face the torture which descends upon them from the above and overtakes them from the below, then they will realize that their “wish” is being granted as they will hear: “Now taste the consequence of your wrongdoings.”
O’ My believing servants, My earth is vast. So [if you cannot worship your Lord freely, migrate to a land where you may] worship Me [freely.]
Every living being has to taste death; then to Me you will eventually be returned.
I will settle down those who chose to believe and did good works in the high mansions in the Paradise, beneath which canals will be flowing. They will live therein forever. What an excellent reward for those who chose to be righteous.
They were those who chose to be patient and to rely upon their Lord.
[If you have to migrate to another land to be able to worship your Lord freely, do not worry about not being able to carry nothing.] There are so many creatures around you that do not carry their provisions with them. God will provide for them as well as you. [do not worry as] God hears everything and knows everything.
If you ask the disbelievers [of Mecca], “Who has created the earth and the heavens and Who has subjected the sun and the moos [to follow the laws of the nature]”, they will surely say, “God.” How come then they do not follow the Lord’s path?
God is the One Who gives more to some of His servants and less to the others. [there is a reason for this inequitable distribution of income as] God knows the best.
If you ask the disbelievers [of Mecca], “Who sends down rainwater from the sky and thereby gives life to the dead land?” they will surely reply “God.” Say: “Then He alone is worthy of all praise.” What a shame that most of them they do not get it.
The life of this world is nothing but a game [like the one that the students’ practices in the school to get some know how.] The real life starts in Hereafter, if they only knew.
When they are overwhelmed by fear in their ship [or any other vehicle in danger], they pray to God wholehearted. when God brings them safe to land, they return to their practice of worshipping others beside God!
Let them be ungrateful and “enjoy” this worldly life for a while; they will soon come to know [how wrong they have been.]
Do they not realize that the safety of their sacred sanctuary [Mecca] in the midst of their dangerous country is a favor of God? Are they going to be grateful [and praise the Lord] or still persisting in worshipping others beside God?
Who is more wicked than the one who fabricate lies and attributes them to God, or rejects the truth presented to him? Is Hell not an appropriate place for such a disbeliever?
As for those who devote themselves to the cause of the Lord, I will guide them to My path. God surely stands with the righteous ones.
A.L.M.
The Romans have been defeated [by the Iranian army]….
in your neighborhood but pretty soon they will be victorious with the help of God……
When this prophecy is fulfilled, the believers will rejoice of the fulfillment of God’s promise (prophecy), God helps whoever He wants;….
indeed God is the Mightiest and the Most Merciful.
God always keeps His promise but most people simply do not get it.
People are so engaged in this worldly life that they are careless about Hereafter.
Don’t people ever think about the creation of the earth, the heavens and whatever is between to realize that there is a purpose behind this creation and that all this is not created in vain and on a whim? The whole universe has a life span determined in advance by God;what a shame that most people think this life will last forever and that they will never stand in front of their Creator [to be accountable for their deeds.]
Do the people not travel and see what happened to the disbelievers before them? They used to be more powerful, more prosperous and more advanced. It was not God who was unjust to them. [On the contrary,] God [out of His mercy] sent them Prophets with undeniable miracles [to guide them to the right path.] It was they who were unjust to their own soul [and chose the wrong path.]
Evil was the end of those who chose to be evil by making fun of the Lord’s revelations.
God is the One Who originates the creation with a re-production mechanism in it. To God is the final return of all.
When it comes the time that all should stand in front of the Lord, the guilty ones are for the shock of their life.
Then none of those whom they worshipped beside the Lord [their idols, women, wealth, “superiors”, etc.] can be of any help to them. That is when they will sincerely believe in the oneness of God.
On the Day of Resurrection the mankind will be divided into two groups: the successful ones and those who failed.]
Those who believed and did good deeds will be sent to live happily ever after in the garden of Paradise.
The second group, who chose to cover the truth, reject the revelations of the Lord, and make fun of the Hereafter, will be presented for being sentenced to punishment.
So [now that you know there is justice after all and that your good deeds will not be in vain,] worship your Lord at night and early in the morning.
Only God deserves to be thanked for and praised by whatever [which has consciousness] in the earth and in the heavens. Therefore, worship your Lord early and late afternoon.
God is the One Who gives life to dead things [all living species are made of the matter which by its very definition is dead] and makes a living being die [a dead corps was a living being just a few seconds ago!] He gives life [in front of your very own eyes] to a dead land, [how can you then deny the resurrection which takes place in front of your eyes every day?]. Likewise, you, too, will be resurrected.
One of the miracles [denoting the existence] of God is your very own creation from the matter and then letting you colonize the earth.
Another sign of the existence of God is the creation of your spouses from your own species so that [you do not suffer from loneliness and that] you may find tranquility [living next to each other.] It is God who sparks love between you. There are many subjects to reflect about this topic for those who use their brains.
Another miracle [denoting the existence of God] is the creation of the heavens and the earth as well as difference in your languages [and cultures] and skin colors. Surely there are many lessons in these subjects for the learned ones [it is a fact that the difference is the vehicle of the growth. Similarity leads to decay. As a matter of fact there are not two ice crystals similar in the whole universe. It is through healthy competition that the creation expands.]
Another sign of the existence of God is your sleeping at night, or during the day, so that [your batteries are recharged and] you may work for your livelihood. Again there are many subjects to be learnt from this topic for those who hear.
Another sign [denoting the existence of God] is the lightening that makes you fear [of being struck with or wood fires] and, at the same time, hope [for a better harvest.] God is the One Who pours down water from the sky to revive the land after its death. In this too there are many lessons to be learnt from by those who think.
Among His proof [of existence] is [not only the creation of the universe but also] the continuous functioning of the creation by His order. As soon as God summons you with one call from the earth, you will all rush to meet your Lord.
To God belongs whatever which exists in the heavens and the earth. Everything has to follow His commands [man is given a small degree of the freedom of choice in order to be tested.]
God is the One Who starts the process of creation and then puts in it a mechanism so that the creation reproduces itself and this [resurrection of yours] is [much] easier for Him [than your original creation that you yourself are witnessing.] To God belongs the best names and attributes in the heaven and the earth; He is the Allmighty, the Most Wise.
Consider your own religious chants [the pagans were used to chant in their pilgrimage to Mecca: “O God, we worship you as well as those whom you have chosen as your partners!] Would you ever chose your own slaves as your partners? Then why should God choose his own creatures as His partner? This is the way that God presents His arguments so that the disbelievers use common sense [and not worship anyone beside the Lord.]
What a shame that the wicked ones are following their own [lowly] desires without thinking about its consequences. Who can guide a person [like these wicked people who deserve to be] misled by God? No one can help them.
Therefore, [forget about these lost causes] and devote yourself to [Islam which is] the purest religion which satisfies the spiritual needs of mankind. Man’s nature [and his spiritual needs], as programmed by God, can not be changed and this [Islam] is a perfect religion for mankind. What a shame that most people do not realize it.
Submit yourself wholly to God, have the utmost respect toward your Lord [and keep Him always in mind], Worship your Lord on regular basis (at least five times a day) and do not be one of those who worship beside the Lord.
The latter are those who [like Christians] divided themselves into different sects [each one adding their own man-made rules to the natural religion which was originally offered to them by God through His Prophets] each enjoying what pleases them!
when people are in trouble, they turn whole man needs to worship God. If he denies the Lord, he will end up worshipping false gods (idols, women, money, superiors, movie stars, ball players, etc.) heartedly to the Lord. When God, out of His mercy removes the hardship, some of them return to their practice of worshipping beside God.
This is their way of showing their ingratitude for My favors! That is fine, enjoy your life for a while and then you will see [its consequences with your own eyes.]
On what basis do they attribute My favors on them to other gods?
When I shower people with some favor, they welcome and enjoy it. When, in account of their [ungrateful] behavior, they are caught in a distressful situation, they loose faith!
Can they not understand that God [in order to try people in wealth and poverty] gives some more and some less? In this unequal distribution of income there is much food for thought for those who think.
Therefore, if you are blessed with the Lord’s favor, give the right of your relatives, needy people and the stranded travelers [and not treat them like the “transients”]. This [voluntary] contribution is the best mean to have the Lord’s attention. Such charitable people are the true successful ones.
If you pay interest to someone who has loaned you money, you have not increased his wealth in the sight of God. The only way that a wealthy person may increase his “wealth” at the sight of God is through charity aimed to please God.
God is the One Who has created you, then He assigned for you a provision to live, then He will make you taste the death and, finally, He will bring you back to life. Is there any of those whom you adore capable of doing any of the above mentioned things? Glorified is God and far above having a partner [like Jesus Christ] as the disbelievers believe.
Man spreads evil in the land and the sea. God [out of His mercy] may make some wrongdoers [which there is still hope for them] to taste the result of their evil works in this life so that [after having a shock] they come to their senses and return to the right path.
Say, “Travel around and see with your own eyes the ruins of the historical nations. Most of them were doomed in account of worshipping others beside God.
Therefore, devote yourself whole heartedly to this perfect religion before the arrival of the Day on which God will not give you any second chance. How shocked will be people on that Day.
The one who chooses the disbelief, is hurting his own soul. The one who chooses a righteous life, on the contrary, strengthens his soul.
God will reward generously those who believe and lead a righteous life. Indeed God does not like those who cover the truth.
You may find the proof of [the existence and the greatness of] the Lord in the winds that He sends to carry the good news of approaching rain clouds and let the ships to sail by His Command so that you find your provision and be grateful to your Lord.
I (God) sent the Prophets with undeniable miracles to the previous nations. When their disbelievers denied the truth, I took vengeance on the guilty ones. Indeed it was My obligation to help the believers.
It is God Who creates the winds to stir up the clouds and then takes them wherever He pleases. When He orders the rain drops to fall,….
His servants who were desperate for rain become happy.
Look around and find out the signs of your Lord’s mercy in reviving the dead land [to provide food for you.] He will bring you back to life after death in the same manner. God is capable of doing everything.
Now if I [try their belief and] send a [heat wave or frosty] wind to turn their crops [which is grown by the God sent rain at first place] yellow, they will become even more firm in their disbelief!
[O’ Mohammad,] you can not deliver your message to a dead person, nor can you make the deaf to here your call. What can you co, if they turn away and show their back?
Nor can you guide a blind [who is not willing to hold a guiding hand.] Only those people hear you who believe in My revelations and chose to become [firmer and firmer] submitters (Muslims.)
God is the One Who creates you as a weak individual, then made you stronger and stronger and then turned you into a weak person in your old ages. God [in this manner shows where man's strength originates from and] creates whatever He wills. God is the most knowledgeable and have power over everything.
When man is resurrected, the wrongdoers swear that their whole life was not more than an hour long! For the same token, they were wrong in other perceptions of theirs [about other matters that they used to deny as they did not have any understanding of what the truth is all about.]
The response of those who chose the belief and [in consequence] got the knowledge will be: "According to the book of God [and unlike your relative impression of the passage of time] you lived a full life till this Day of your resurrection. However, you did not realize it [and missed your opportunity.]"
On that Day, no excuse of the wrongdoers will be accepted; nor will they be given any opportunity to please the Lord.
In this Qur'an, I (God) have cited every sort of arguments [aimed at different people at different levels]. However, no matter what kind of miracle or reasoning you come up with, the disbelievers will say that you are on the wrong path.
This is why God seals the hearts of those who refuse the knowledge [so that they slide further toward the darkness as a punishment for their refusal.]
Be patient; know that God's promise is true and do not be intimidated by those who have lost their opportunity to believe.
A.L.M.
Hereby you are witnessing the verses of the most wise book (Qur’an).
This book is guidance and a mercy of God offered to those who do good things for mankind.
The latter are those who worship God on regular basis, devote a part of their income/ abilities to charitable actions and prepare themselves for their eternal life which follows this earthly life.
The above mentioned people are the one who will continue receiving guidance from their Lord and are the “real” successful ones [in spite of the fact that they may not succeed in gathering wealth, power, etc. in this world].
As to those talented speakers who use their appealing jokes while delivering fiery but meaningless speeches to divert people from the straight path of God, an awful punishment is waiting for them.
To these people who turn from God’s words when recited to them and do not listen to it as though they are deaf, let (Mohammad) them know what a painful punishment is in reserve for them.
Those who believe and do good things, they will be welcomed in the gardens of Paradise.
They will live in Paradise forever; this is a true promise of God. God is Almighty, the Most Wise.
God is the One Who has created the heavens without any visible pillar. On the earth, He has set the mountains (to regulate the movement of the earth), scattered all kinds of animals and sent down rainwater from the sky to cause a variety of vegetation to grow.
Such is the creation of God; now show Me what those whom you worship beside God have created. The fact of the matter is that these wicked people have chosen an obvious false ideology.
As to LoghmanI enjoined wisdom upon him so that he may thank God. Whoever is thankful to God, he is kind to his own soul; whoever chooses to be ungrateful, [he has chosen to hurt his own soul and] should know that God is not in need of anyone’s gratefulness as He is Self-Sufficient and is being praised [more than enough by His angels.]
I want you to know about Loghman’s advising his son: “My son, do not worship anyone except God. The truth is that raising the others to the level of God is a great injustice.”
Now that the subject centers around the children’s’ obedience,] I have Myself made it a duty for the mankind to show the utmost respect toward his parents; especially the mother. She bears him while being always sick [due to the nature of the pregnancy.] Then it takes two years of intensive care of the mother so that the baby turns into a child. [That is why I say:] “Be grateful to your Lord and your parents.” Know that to Me is your return.
The only time that you should not obey your parents is when they ask you to worship the others beside God. In such a case, be kind to them but follow the path of those who have submitted themselves to their Lord. Know that you will eventually return to Me and [you do not want to beembarrassed when] I will inform you of what you have been doing with your life.
continuing his advice, Loghman said:] “ O my son, even a tiny thing, as small as a mustard seed, hidden inside a stone, anywhere in the universe, can not escape the Lord’s knowledge and grasp; He is the Most Supreme, the Most Knowledgeable.
“O’ my son, worship the Lord regularly & frequently, invite people to do the good deeds and prevent them of wrongdoings and work on your patience. These are the noble characteristics.”
“Do not treat people with arrogance and do not walk proudly on the earth [an excellent advice for people with the colonialist attitude]. Know that God does not like proud people.”
“Walk in a humble manner and do not talk loud; the most disgraceful of all voices is the loud voice of a donkey.”
Do you not see that God has put at your disposal whatever is in the earth and the heavens? Do you not see that God has showered you with visible and invisible favors? What a shame that there are some people who argue about [the existence or characteristics of] God without having any knowledge and background about this subject.
When these people are asked to follow what God has revealed, they say: “We will follow only whatever our forefathers were following [no matter if they were wrong or right!] What kind of reasoning is this? Will they followed Satan, even if he calls them to end up in the raging Fire?
Whoever submits himself to God and does good deeds, has got hold of the most reliable support. The highest chain of command who controls everything is God.
As for the one who denies God, let not his disbelief bother you. All disbelievers have to meet their Lord eventually. Then I will play back their deeds for them [so that they see and be ashamed of what they were doing.] God knows everyone’s secrets.
I will let them enjoy their lives in this world for a while and then let them hopelessly taste the worse punishment.
If you ask them: “Who has created the earth and the heavens?” they will say: “God.” Say: “Thank Lord [that at least you know this much]; If it is so then none should be worshipped but the Lord.” What a shame that most of them are deprived of common sense.
Yes. To God belongs everything in the heavens and in the earth. God is self sufficient and not in need of anyone’s adoration.
If all trees on earth were to become pens, and seven times existing oceans the inkpot, the words [explaining creativity, manifestations and wisdom] of God would not run off. God is Almighty, the Most Wise.
I have created you all together as one being [like a beehive which is composed of thousands of bees but together they constitute one being] and will resurrect you as one being [perhaps meaning that the way that we live individually affects the way that our society grows up and therefore we will individually be held responsible for the failures of our society.] Know that God hears everything [that we say and affects the society] and sees everything [that we do and affects the society.]
Do you not [look around and see the most amazing natural phenomena that you take it for granted such as planet earth turning around itself at some 30,miles an hour so that you] see the night merges into the day and the day merges into the night by the will of God? Do you not see that the sun and the moon are paving their predetermined course by the will of God until they reach their final destiny? The same God [who knows what the planets are doing] knows what you are doing.
God [who is behind all this majestic creation] is the Truth and those whom you worship [idols, women, wealth, boss, etc.] are false gods [as they do not have any part in the creation.] Only God is the Most High, the Most Great.
Do you not see that the ship [which is heavier than water] sails in the sea by the grace of God [who has made the winds amicable and has appeased the currents]? In this [taken for granted phenomenon] there are many signs for each patient [scientist who devotes all his life to study the laws of the nature] and grateful person [who thanks God for making such huge planet earth so hospitable.]
When a violent wave [reminding the leashed power of the nature] approaches the ship, the passengers panic and [no matter how pagan they are] invoke God [to leash the awesome power of the nature for them] sincerely devoting their prayers to God alone. When God brings them safely to the land, some of them take the middle course [to please both Caesar and God!] Only a treacherous [who lied in his prayers] and an unappreciative person [who did not thank God for being taken to safety from a dangerous situation] deny the revelations of the Lord.
O’ people, have the utmost respect toward the Lord and fear the Day when no father can do anything for his son and no son can do anything for his father. God is telling you the truth; therefore, do not let this jazzy world distract you [from the right path] and do not let the Satan and his disciples you take you away from [the camp of] the Lord.
Only God knows the time of the Day of the resurrection. Only God sends down the rain [which everyone begs for in a drought or in a massive wood fire, no matter how technologically advanced they are.] Only God knows what is taking shape [physically and psychologically] in the womb of the mother. No living being knows what he will earn the next day, nor does anybody know in what land he will die. Only God knows everything and is All-Aware.
A.L.M.
This is a book that there is no doubt about its revelation from the Creator of the worlds.
The disbelievers say: “Mohammad has fabricated this book.” This is not true. God has sent this book, through Mohammad, to those, for whom there has not come a Warner for the longest time, so that they may be directed to the right path.
God is the One Who Created the heavens and the earth in six periods (steps); then He took absolute control of His realm of creation from His Throne. You do not have any guardian or person to pray for you except Him. Don’t you get it?
Everything is controlled by God through His established administrative system. His orders are sent to the far most corner of the universe, and the response is beamed back to Him, in a day of His calendar which is equal to one thousand years of your calendar.
God alone knows all secrets and non-secret matters. He is the Almighty, the Most Kind.
God is the One Who created everything in its best possible outcome. He created man from the matter.
Then He designed the man’s reproductive procedure to be carried on through a lowly liquid.
Then He completed the man’s creation by breathing into him of His Spirit and gave you the ears, the eyes and the hearts. Yet you are rarely grateful [for getting consciousness by the grace of God and to understand and enjoy the marvel of His realm of Creation.]
They [jokingly] say: “Is it true that after our death, and the eventual transformation into dust, we are going to be re-created again?” This simply indicates that they do not believe that they have an appointment to meet with their Lord.
Say: “An angel will take away your soul in his charge. Then you will be recreated to meet with the Lord.”
I wish you could see the criminals standing head down in front of their Lord saying: “ O Lord, now that we have seen and heard the truth with all our senses, please send us back and let us lead a righteous life. Indeed we are convinced now.”
In reply they will hear: “If I wanted, I would have given every soul its guidance from the beginning [but then, the freedom of choice would have lost then its meaning.] Now my word is materialized when I promised to fill the Hell with men and extra-terrestrials [who, in their absolute freedom, chose to disobey God.]
Now in response to your forgetting the existence of this Day, God will forget you on this Day. Taste the everlasting torture as a punishment of your wrongdoings.
When God’s revelations are recited, some people fall down in prostration and glorify their Lord in their worshipping. These are the true believers; the ones who are not proud.
The true believers are those who sacrifice a part of their sleeping time to worship their Lord. They are afraid to offend their Lord with [the least of] their action and hope in getting their rewards from Him. They are the one who devote a part of their resources [which is given to them by God at first place] to God pleasing ends.
No one can even imagine what kind of eye pleasing reward God has provided for the believers for their righteous acts.
Does it make sense to you that the sinners and the believers be treated equally?
Those who believe and do the good deeds, will end up in beautiful Gardens and be entertained. This is their reward for their good deeds.
The wrongdoers, on the contrary, will end up in the Hell. Anytime they try to flee, they will be pushed back into the Fire and they will be told: “Taste the torture of the same Fire which you used to deny its existence.”
In order to give the wrongdoers an opportunity [to change their rebellious attitude], they will get a few punishments in this world before their great punishment in the Hereafter. May they wake up.
Who is more unjust to his own soul than the one who hears direct words of God and then turns away from it? I (God) will certainly take vengeance from such a criminal.
[These revelations of God are nothing new.] I gave Moses the Book [Torah], before this [Qur’an] and made that Book a source of guidance for the Jews. Therefore, do not harbor any doubt about Qur’an.
When the Jews believed and developed the patience, I raised among them the leaders to guide them to the right path.
On the Day of Judgment, I will point out to them what misled them later and caused them to differ in the religious issues [which turned them away from the right path.]
Have they not learnt anything from the miserable destiny of the previous people whom God destroyed in their own houses? There are many lessons to be learnt from this. Do they ever hear?
Do they not see that it is God [not their technologies] Who sends the [rain] water to their dead land and let it produce crops that they and their animals eat from [and then have the audacity to deny the existence of God by not obeying His orders.] How can they not see all this?
They jokingly ask: “Tell us when this victory of yours will take place, if you are truthful.”
Tell them, : “When the victory takes place, those who choose to disbelieve will not benefit from it at all. They will not be given a second chance either.”
They are the lost cause, therefore] Leave them alone and wait, as they are waiting to.
O’ Prophet, be at awe only with God and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites; trust in God alone who is the Most Knowledgeable and Wise.
And follow whatever God has revealed to you; indeed God isaware of what you do.
And have trust in your Lord as God is the best protector.
[as] God has not given two hearts to people [either you should follow Islam or your tradition]. Your divorced wives [unlike the old tradition of the ignorance] are not considered as your mothers neither are your adopted sons as your real sons [in right]. These [ignorance days’ traditions] are only words flowing from people’s mouth [without any rational behind them]. God’s words are based upon reality and your Lord is the only one who guides you toward the right path.
Call your adopted sons by their genetic father’s (family) name. If you do not know their last name, cal them as “My brothers in Islam”. If you are careless in this domain you will not be considered as a sinner; God is indeed forgiving [of these little sins] and the Most Merciful.
The relationship bond between the Prophet (Mohammad) and the believers is superior to the relationship bond between them and any of their relatives. The Wives of the Prophet must be respected by the believers the same way that they respect their own mother. In accordance with the Lord’s scripture, the blood relationship has superiority over other relationships [the blood relations should take care of each other first.] However, there is nothing wrong in showing kindness to your friends [provided that you have taken care of your blood relatives first.] This is written in the Book of God.
Remember the solemn promise that you (Mohammad), Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus (son of Mary) and all other prophets made to Me; a very solid promise [to be the first to follow the revealed orders of God, to relay their revelations to the others, to show no laxity in the struggle to enforce them, etc.]
So that the Lord may test the truthfulness of the believers and sentence the disbelievers to a painful punishment for their disobedience.
O’ you who believe, remember the Lords favor upon you [on the battle of the trench] which He has [just now] demonstrated: When the [12,men army] of the disbelievers came down on you, I sent against them a strong wind and an army that you could not see. God was [and always is] watching over you.
When the enemies came upon you from every side, your eyes were petrified of fear and your hearts started to beat up faster. Then you started to entertain [all kind of] doubt about your Lord.
This was an occasion to seriously test the extent of your belief.
Then the hypocrites, and those who suffer from the sickness of lack of will power, openly said: “What God and His Prophet promised us wan nothing but a delusion.”
A group of them went far enough to say: “You [foolish] people of Medina, you have no chance in the [upcoming] battle; fly the front.” A group of them went to the Prophet and asked to leave the battle front saying: “Our homes are in danger.” They were just looking for an excuse to flee.
If the enemies had conquered the city and had asked them for any kind of treachery [such as providing vital information about whereupon of the believers], they would have easily committed it without any hesitation.
These are the same people who [after their disobedience in the battle of Uhud] pledged to God [that they would make up for their failure in the future trials.] Making a pledge with God involves a great responsibility [God cannot be deceived by empty words and, just two years after the battle of Uhud, put them to this test.]
Say to them: “You can never fly from death. Your attempt to flee will buy you only a short period of time to enjoy.”
Say to them: “Who can protect you from God, if He wants to test you by a hardship? Who can prevent Him, if He wants to bestow a favor upon you?” In fact, there is none to turn to as a protector or a helper against God.
Indeed God knows those of them who do not want to join the war effort and those of them who say to their friends: “Stay with us.” These are those who would like to participate the least in the battle campaign.
When it comes to helping you [Mohammad], they are the least enthusiastic; but when a danger threatens them, they will look at you for help with eyes so frightened as though they are going to die any minute. When the danger is gone, they come to greet you with flattering words in hope of materialistic gains. These hypocrites are not believers and God will nullify their good deeds, which is the easiest thing for God to do.
They cannot believe their eyes that the enemy’s army has gone away. If it happened such that the enemy returns, they will prefer to be in a small village in the middle of the desert and hear about you from there! They would definitely take the least part in the battle, if the enemy had to return.
O’ Mohammad, your handling the war effort made you the role model for those who look forward to their Lord, the Day of Judgment and remember God very frequently.
As to the true believers, when they saw the [12,men army of the] enemy ready to attack, [instead of loosing faith] they said: “ This is what God and His Prophet had promised [that we are going to be tested in difficult situations]”. This [desperate] situation instead increased their belief!
Some of the believers have already passed their test and have fulfilled their pledge to [be loyal to] God and some will face their test pretty soon. The believers have never changed their position.
[All these difficult situations are meant so that] God may reward the sincere believers and to punish the hypocrites; although He [has left the door of repentance open so that He] may accept their repentance. Indeed God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
[See how] God made the disbelievers army to retreat while in rage without any gain. God Himself was enough [to fight against them for] for the believers. Indeed God is the Most Powerful, the Almighty [only one sand storm of Him and a mighty army looses the ground!]
As to the Jews [of Bani Quraizah], who joined the enemy’s army, God brought them down from their strong fortress and put such a fear of you in their hearts that today you easily slaughter them in the battle or take them as prisoners.
God made you inherit their land, their homes, their money and the lands that you had never even stepped on. God has the power and can make anything to happen.
O’ Prophet, say to your wives [who were apparently not satisfied with their economic situations and, like most ordinary people, were looking for more]: “If your primary interest is the vanities of this world, no problem. Let us get separated in an amicable manner and God will give you anything you wish for in this world….
However, if your ultimate goal is to please God, be obedient to the Prophet and have a good life in Hereafter [rather than this world], know that God has a reward for those of you who engage in good deeds in reserve [the Prophet’s wives chose the second choice.]”
The wives of the Prophet should know that if they commit an indecency, God will punish them twice as much as He would have punished an ordinary person for it; and you know that this is very easy for God to do it. …
If they do a good deed, on the other hand, they will be rewarded twice as much as God would reward an ordinary person for that good deed. For such a good wife of the Prophet, God has an honorable provision in reserve.
Wives of the Prophet, you are not like ordinary women [you are the role model and have a social responsibility]. If you are God fearing, do not speak too softly; this may cause some men, with a disease in their hearts, to entertain the wrong ideas. Instead, speak business like. Stay at home [settle down, stick firmly, live peacefully, sit with dignity and take control of the internal affair of your household]; …..
do not go out and display your jewelries like the women of the ignorance days [In today’s “democracies” when a man is elected as at the president, his wife immediately engaged in political activities in spite of the fact that the people did not cast any vote for her. In this connection the wives of the Prophet are prohibited from taking part in the political affairs of the newly established Islamic State.] ….
Worship the Lord on regular basis, engage in charity and obey God and His Prophet. God’s main intention [of all these teachings] is to purify the Prophet’s household by showing you how to get rid of bad habits. Think about what is being recited in your house of the Lord’s revelations and the rationale behind it. Know that God is watching and knows everything.
Know that the men and women who are submissive [to the will of God], believer, obedient, truthful, patient, bow down and prostrate to God, engage in charitable actions, fast when they are supposed to, avoid nudity and teasing through body language and remember God by reciting His Words frequently are protected by God’s mercy and forgiveness and there is a big reward in reserve for them.
A believing man/ woman will never challenge a decision of the Lord and His Prophet. Whoever disobeys God and His Prophet, is among the losers.
O’ Mohammad, remember when [your adopted son] Zaid (who is blessed by God and His Prophet) came to you consulting about his wife? You tried to reunite them (in spite of the fact that you had some feelings about her.) You were afraid of what people might say and think; however, you should be afraid only of God. I ordered you to marry his Ex-wife [whom he divorced in spite of the Prophet’s reuniting efforts] in order to set a precedent that a man may marry the divorced wife of his adopted son. God’s command shall be done.
There is nothing wrong with the Prophet’s following the order of God [this indicates that the Prophet’s marriage with his adopted son’s Ex-wife was an order]. The previous Prophets also had to obey the Lord’s orders; God’s command is a settled decree.
The Prophets who relay the Lord’s messages fear non but Him [and do not disobey His orders because they are afraid that people may not appreciate them.] It should be enough for a person to know that God appreciates his deeds [no matter what the others think or say.]
Mohammad is not the father of any man among you [including his own adopted son.] Mohammad is the last Prophet of God [and had to obey the order of God and to marry his adopted son’s Ex-wife to nullify once and forever the existing tradition.] Indeed God knows everything [and knows that this tradition is baseless.]
O’ you who believe, turn to God and mention Him frequently.
O’ you who believe, Glorify God every morning and evening.
God is the One who showers you with His blessings. The Lord’s angels pray for you so that God may perfect His blessing upon you by bringing you out of darkness into light. God is very kind to the believers.
The believers will be greeted (on the Day that they have the appointment to meet with the Lord) with “Peace” and God has already prepared for them an honorable reward.
O’ Prophet (Mohammad), I have sent you as a witness [to verbally explain the truth as you have witnessed it, to conduct a way of life which is a witness to a God pleasing way of life and to be a witness in the Hereafter as to how the people responded to the truth], the bearer of the good news [about the Paradise] and a Warner [explaining the true nature of the Hell for those still have time to save themselves from it.]
O’ Prophet, I have sent you to invite the people toward the Lord, with His permission [the wicked people are already deprived of such an opportunity] and serve as a guiding beacon.
O’ Prophet, I have sent you to let the believer know that there are great rewards in reserve for them out of the generosity of God.
Do not yield to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Take their persecution lightly and put your trust in God. If you put your trust in God, you are in need of nobody.
The believers are hereby informed that: If they marry a woman and divorce her before having sex with, the woman may remarry immediately and does not owe her Ex-husband a waiting period [of three periods.] It is the duty of the man to provide such a woman with some kind of material well being and send her of gracefully.
O’ Prophet, I have relaxed the laws concerning the marriage for you and only you [so that, as the Head of the State of those days, he may have the flexibility of using the marriage ties for social/ political or other considerations.] You may therefore keep your already married wives and marry the following women: Those whom God has given you as a slave [captured in different wars or being offered by other Head of the States], the daughters of your paternal and maternal uncles and aunts, who have migrated with you, and the believing woman who asks the Prophet to marry her without the dowry, (if the Prophet has a mutual interest in her.) The restriction on the marriage for the Muslim men are already explained in detail and these exceptions [made for the Prophet] is to save you any embarrassment [due to the political nature of the Head of the State position in the future.] God is thus the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
[In order to relieve you (Mohammad) of the domestic worries so that you could carry out your duties,] Your are granted the option to shun away any of your wives, bring closer to you any one of them and there will be no blame on you, if you reconcile with the ones that you have put aside. It is expected from them to understand [that as the wife of Prophet they cannot expect an ordinary life and] that they will be content with whatever you give them. God knows what is going on in your heart. God knows everything [and due to his knowledge of the situation, He is understanding] and the Most Merciful.
It is no more lawful for you to take no other woman, beyond the categories explained above, except the slave girls. [As your wives have become pleased with any way that you treat them and have rejected the world in preference to the Hereafter,] It is no more lawful for you that you should divorce any of your wives to replace them with the others (even though the latter’ beauty may be extremely appealing.)
The believers hereby are forbidden to enter the houses of the Prophet without permission and are not supposed to delay their stay hoping to be fed. Enter, if you are invited. Eat, if you are offered and leave immediately. Do not bother the Prophet with lengthy discussions; he is shy asking you to leave but God is not shy in bringing to your attention [theses etiquettes.] If you have to talk to the wives of the Prophet, do not talk face to face; talk from behind a curtain. This is better for the purity of your hearts as well as theirs. You should not do/say anything to hurt the Prophet of God. You should also not [as a sign of respect] marry any of the wives of the Prophet after him [as you are not supposed to marry your fathers’ wives after his death out of respect]; this is a great sin in the sight of God.
Know that whatever you say or keep as a secret, God knows it as God has full knowledge over everything.
They [the wives of the Prophet as well as other women in general] may [relax their dress code around and] be visited by their fathers, sons, brothers, brothers & sisters’ sons, female friends and their slaves. Respect God’s order and remember that He is watching whatever you do.
God and His angels shower the Prophet (Mohammad) with their blessings. If you are a believer, you, too, should respect him and follow his orders to the point.
Those who do or say the least against God and His Prophet, carry the Lord’s curse in this world and will be punished in a disgraceful manner in the Hereafter.
Those who do or say something wrong against the believing men and women, are engaged in slandering, which is a great sin.
O’ Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, as well as other believing women, that they should cover their face with their outer garment [say a scarf] until their front [a Muslim woman’s “uniform” completely covers her body, without showing the curvatures of the body. Only the palm of her hands and feet and the face from the front to chin may be visible.] It is expected that they will thus be recognized and respected. God is Forgiving [when it comes to the past practices] and merciful [to those who follow the Islamic laws from now on.]
If the hypocrites, those who have a psychological problem [illwishers of Islam (though Muslim themselves), cherishing evil intentions and having criminal mentalities] and those who spread baseless rumors in Medina do not stop it, I (God) will help you to reveal their true natures so that they may hardly be able to live in this city and leave it out of shame.
They will be cursed from every side, persecuted and killed.
This has been the way that God has dealt with people like that before and you will notice that God’s system [of justice] is unchangeable.
People will ask you about the end of the world. Let them know that only God knows about it. As far as people are concerned, they should be prepared as though it will take place within a few moment.
[whether it is near at hand or long time from now,] God has laid curse on the disbelievers and has prepared the blazing Hellfire for them.
The disbelievers will live in Hellfire forever and will find no one to protect or help them from the torture they are sentence to.
When they face the fire, they will say: “We wish that we had followed God and His Prophet.”
They will say: “O Lord, our leaders, whom we followed wrongly, misleads us…..
May you double their punishment and put your most sever curse on them.”
God hereby orders the believing Muslims not to treat their Prophet the way that the Jews treated Moses. God cleared Moses of their slanders; he was the honorable in the sight of God.
God hereby orders the believers to say the right thing.
God hereby promises to raise the good deeds of the believers to the heaven and to overlook their mistakes. The one who obeys God and His Prophet, has indeed achieved the real success.
I (God) offered the responsibility [freedom of choice and being God’s vice-gerent] to the heavens, the earth and the mountains [this indicates that the matter is also a living species having a spirit of its own. After all, how can its electrons circle around their nucleolus without energy and spirit?], they refused to bear it[as they were afraid of failing in such a big mission.] Only man accepted this mission; how ignorant this unjust creature is.
[What is at stake with the success/ failure in this mission is that] God will punish the hypocritical men and women and those men and women who worship others beside God. God will accept the repentance of the believing men and women as God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
One should be grateful to God to Whom belongs everything in the heavens and in the earth. Praise is also for the Lord in the Hereafter. God is the Most Wise and the Most knowledgeable.
God has absolute knowledge about whatever that hides itself in the depth of the earth and whatever that comes out of the earth. God also knows whatever that descends from the sky and whatever that ascends toward the heavens. Lord is the Most Forgiving and gracefully covers the sins.
The disbelievers say: “The dooms day will never take place”. Tell them O Mohammad that it surely will happen at exactly when it is supposed to happen. God knows what will happen in the future. There is not even an atom in his domain of creation that He does not know about its whereabouts. The information about everything, smaller or bigger than an atom, does already exist in his book of knowledge.
With such an incomparable knowledge, God is going to reward those who believe and do good things. They will receive His forgiveness and a generous provision in the Paradise.
Those who try to discard the Lord’s revelations, on the contrary, will receive an awful punishment in the Hell.
For those who are blessed with a sound mind, it is obvious that this revelation of God to you is the truth. Qur’an guides man to the path of All Mighty and Praiseworthy.
The disbelievers [jokingly] say: “Do you want us to show you a man (Mohammad) who claims that you will be resurrected after death when your body (after being transferred into the particles) is scattered all over!”
[Then they continue saying:] “Who knows; either he is a liar or has gone crazy.” Indeed those who disbelieve in the Hereafter have gone too far and will be severely punished.
Do the disbelievers not look around and realize that [they owe their very life to the mercy and the grace of the same God that they deny and] if the Lord decides, He can sink them underground or send a meteor from the sky to destroy them. Only those servants of God who turn to him understand the magnitude of His Grace {and are grateful for that].
[As to the Jews who are not behaving to the Lord’s satisfaction, remind them that] I (God) showered David [who conquered Jerusalem for the Jews and established the first God worshipping kingdom] with my blessing….
I subdued the mountains and the birds to him so that they join him in worshipping Me. I also taught him how to build the weapons from Iron. O people of David [the Jews] please Me with good deeds and do not forget that I am watching whatever you are doing.
As to Solomon [David’s son], I blessed him with the ability to order the winds to travel [and carry the clouds and the rain water] such far distances which would take them a month to go and a month to return. I also provided him with a gushing oil well. I also subdued the Jinns (Extra-terrestrials) to offer him their know how; if any of them would rebel, he would have been punished.
The Extra-terrestrials would build for him anything he wanted: buildings with statues and paintings, deep pools, heavy cooking instruments, etc. O’ people of David (the Jews) be grateful [for what God endowed your culture with], in fact only a few of My servants are grateful.
Solomon died standing upright supported by his staff. It took a long time for a small worm to eat his staff and let him fall down. If the Jinns had any knowledge of unseen, they would not have continued to work as a slave for a dead master [the Extraterrestrials’ knowledge, therefore is limited and are not undefeatable, something to be remembered in the future].
[Continuing on the subject of ungratefulness,] Sheba’s land was a wonderful place. One could see nothing but the fruitful gardens to the right and to the left. They were told: “Enjoy your provision and be grateful to God. Pure and pleasant is your land and the Most Forgiving your Lord.
Unfortunately they chose to disobey Me (God) and I broke their irrigation dam causing a big flood. Their fruitful gardens then produced nothing but bitter fruits and a few bushes.
This was their punishment for their disbelief and this is the way that I deal with the ungrateful people.
I had scattered villages between them and the blessed land [probably between Yemen and Palestine and Syria] so that they may travel [from one habitation to the other] with ease and securely by day or by night.
[When this blessing was brought to their attention, instead of becoming grateful] They said: “Make our journey longer and more difficult [who cares].” Thus they wronged their own souls. Eventually we scattered them into small communities and they became history. This should be a lesson for those who are patient and grateful by nature.
The Satan was right about them as they followed him except a small group of the believers. [When God gave respite to Satan, he said: “I will seduce mankind to follow me except a small group of true believers.”]
Satan did not mislead them forcibly. I let him to seduce them as a test to see who believed in Hereafter and who doubted it. Your Lord has full control and watches over everything.
Say: “Call upon those whom you worship beside God [and see whether or not they can help you.] They neither own, nor have partnership in, an atom weight of anything in the entire universe. They are not even an instrument of God’s help.
God will not accept anyone’s intercession, unless it coincides with His Will. When the intercessors are asked by people about the Lord’s decision, they will simply say: “He made the right decision!” God is the Most High, the Most Great.
Ask the disbelievers: “Who provides for you from the heaven [rain] and from the earth [edible materials.]? We believe that it is God. Naturally we cannot be both right and one of us [either the believers or the disbelievers] is wrong.
Say to disbelievers: “ You are not responsible for us [if we are wrong.] For the same token, we are not responsible for your deeds.”
Say: “God will gather us all together one day and judge between us with full justice. He knows everything and will be the best judge.”
Say: “Show me the ones whom you worship beside God [show me their power.] No [they are powerless as you see], it is only God who is the Almighty, the Most Wise.
O’ Mohammad, I have sent you for the entire humanity [not for a given nation] to be a Warner and the bearer of the good news [that your good deeds will be rewarded by permanent residency in Paradise]; unfortunately, most people do not realize it.
[Instead of being appreciative,] They say: “Let the Day of Judgment be today, if you are truthful!”
Say: “The day of Judgment, that you have an appointment in, is predetermined and will not be delayed or advanced even by an hour.”
The disbelievers say: “We will never believe in Qur’an or any previous scriptures.” I wish you could see these people standing in front of God in the Day of Judgment. The weak ones [who idolized the ones whom they worshipped] will say: “If it was not in account of you, we would have been true believers.”
The dominant ones will respond: “Did we force you to deny the guidance when it was represented to you? you yourself made the choice.”
The weak ones will reply: “It was you who campaigned day and night to idolize the others beside God.” Finally, when they face their punishment, they will repent sincerely but [it will be too late and] they will get shackles around their necks. Do they not deserve to be punished for what they did?
Any time that I sent a Warner to a community, its powerful people said: “We do not believe in this message of yours.”
They arrogantly continued: “We have more wealth and children than you; none can hurt us.”
Say: “There is a wisdom in the distribution of wealth [the wealthy ones are not necessarily the favored one and vice versa. Actually, the wealthy ones are usually the wicked ones.] but most people they do not understand it.”
It is not your wealth & children [which is given to them by God at first place] which will bring you nearer to Me. Only those who believe and do good works will get a reward which is several times more than they deserve. Such people will leave in peace and in high places in Paradise.
As for those who consistently challenge God’s revelation, they will end up in an everlasting torture.
Let them know that: “God [in his absolute wisdom] gives more to some and less to the others. He will reward you for whatever you spend from your [God given] income in charity [to please him]; God is the best provider.”
On the Day that all are summoned, God will ask the angels: “Did these people worship you?”
The angels will reply: “Glory is with you; You are our Master not them. [Although apparently they were worshipping us,] In reality they were worshipping the Jinns [led by Satan, who seduced them and misled them in worshipping others beside God] whom they took as their Lord.
On the Day of Judgment, you can neither help (nor harm) each other. On that Day, I will tell those who betrayed their own soul: “Taste the Hellfire that you were used to deny.”
When My revelations are recited to the disbelievers they say: “This man (Mohammad) simply wants to mislead you from the way that your ancestor used to worship.” Then they say: “This Qur’an is nothing but a bunch of fabricated lies.” They also say: “The whole thing is a sorcery.”
They had never received any book nor a Prophet [to teach them the truth] before [therefore, they should be grateful not stubborn.]
The previous disbelievers, who treated My Prophets as liars, were severely punished even though they did not receive even one tenth of the proofs shown to these disbelievers.
Say: “For the sake of God be objective [put your prejudices aside] and think individually or collectively. Why do you call your fellow [whom you were considering as a wise and trustworthy] as mad? He (Mohammad) is only appointed to warn you about an upcoming disaster [the Hellfire.]”
Say: “I am not asking for a wage [for my teaching you the truth]; you can keep it. My reward is with God Who witnesses everything [and values my sincerity in accomplishing my mission.]
Say: “My Lord inspires me with the knowledge of the truth [so that the truth prevails.] God knows every secret.”
Say: “The truth has come. The falsehood cannot neither initiate an attack or prevail.”
Say: “If [as you say] I am on the wrong path, none but me have to pay for it. However, if I am on the right path, it is in account of my Lord’s favor who has revealed the truth to me [and not because that I have discovered the right path.] God hears everything and is Near [to answer the supplications.]”
I wish you could see these people when they face their horrible destiny. They will not be able to escape as they will be seized immediately.
They will say: “We believe in God’s revelations.” But [they should have believed when they lived on earth.] it will be far too late.
They chose to reject our revelation without any objective consideration [and mocked at My Prophets for no good reason.]
That is why their confession will not be accepted. They will have the same fate of the previous disbelievers who entertained too many doubts.
Praiseworthy is God Who is the Originator of the universe. Lord has created Angles with the mean of flying (wing) throughout the universe in charge of managing His Kingdom’s affairs. Some Angles are created with two wings, some have three and some four means of flying. God expands His Universe of Creation as much as He desires.
If God showers someone with something out of His Mercy, no body can take it from that person. On the contrary, whatever God does not intend for someone to have, nobody can give it to that person. God is All Mighty, the Most Wise.
O’ Mankind, be grateful about what God has provided for you. Who else but God showers you with His favors from the sky and the earth? There is no god but Him; How is it then that you turn your back to Him?
O’ Mohammad, never mind if people deny you; the prophets before you went through that experience too. At the end, everything will be brought to His Majesty’s Court for the Judgment.
O’ mankind, the promises of God is true; do not let the glitter of this worldly life deceive you and distant you from your Lord.
Know that the Satan is your enemy. Therefore, treat him as an enemy. The Satan is simply invite you to [join him in] Hellfire.
Those who chose to disbelieve will be severely punished. As to the believers who engage in good deeds, God’s forgiving and a great reward is waiting for them.
Observe those who think that their wrong deeds are the best thing that they have ever done in their life [and thus continuously slide toward the loss.] This is the way that God misleads those whom He wants to [and deserved to] get lost [in account of their deeds]. On the other hand, God leads whoever He wants [and that have sincerely shown their willingness] to follow the right path. Therefore do not be sorry about the destiny of the wrongdoers as God knows [they deserve what they will end up in account of] what they are doing.
God is the One Who makes the winds to raise the clouds and then send it to the dead land to resurrect it after its death. The same God who resurrects the dead land will resurrect the dead people.
The one who is looking for dignity, will find it in God. The good words and praises reach the Lord through the good deeds. As to those who are always engaged in evil plots, their plots will fail and a sever punishment is awaiting them.
Remember that God created you from the matter, then [from the first man] continued your reproduction through a tiny sperm, then divided you into male and female. [God has absolute control over the population.] No woman becomes pregnant, or gives birth, without His knowledge. No one survives above his pre-determined life nor will live shorter. Keeping control over man’s life is easy for God.
Be grateful to God:
Although two seas [living environments] are not alike (one being salty and undrinkable, the other fresh and delicious), from each of them you catch tender to eat meat and extract jewelry to wear. Look at the ships that [with the permission of God] sail through them seeking God’s favor; may you be grateful.
God is the One Who merges the night into the day and replaces the day by night. He is the One Who has subjected the sun and the moon to follow His [established natural] laws until they face their pre-determined destiny. Such is your Lord, the owner of [and in control of ] the entire universe. Know that those whom you adore beside the Lord [idols, women, bosses, wealth, etc.] do not own not even the skin of a date [and are of no use to you.] If you ask them for help, they cannot hear it. Even if they hear your prayer, they cannot answer and on the Day of Judgment they will denounce you. None can answer you better than God the Most Knowledgeable.
Let it be known well that you are poor [owning nothing] and God is the wealthiest [the owner of everything] and not in need of yourpraises
If God decides, He can get rid of you and replace you with a new kind of beings….
this is the easiest thing for God to do.
No one is responsible for somebody else’s deeds and no one can assume responsibility for somebody else’s acts. Not even the dearest ones are capable to respond to someone’s begging them to assume the least of his sins. O Mohammad, only those who respect their Lord has the capacity of absorbing the admonition. Although they do not physically see the Lord, they regularly worship Him. Whoever purifies his soul, does it for his own good. Remember that you all have to face God eventually.
The blind [the one who closes himself to the truth] and the one who sees are not alike.
The darkness [the one who prefers the ignorance] and the light are not alike.
The coolness of the shade [the peace of mind of a believer] and the heat of the sun [the ever present anxiety of a disbeliever] are not alike.
The living [the believer who is attached to the source of life] and the dead [the zombie whose living is reduced only to physical activities] are not equal. God makes those who are willing to hear, to grasp the reality. However, you cannot make a dead person to hear in his grave.
O’ Mohammad, you are only a Warner [it is up to the individuals to hear you or not].
O’ Mohammad, you are armed with the truth. You bear the good news [for those who have chosen to believe] and warn [those who still have the chance to improve themselves.] I have sent a Warner to every nation [none can claim that he has not been warned.]
Never mind if they call you a liar. The nations before you also called their Prophets names and this in spite of the fact that they came with the miracles, the Psalms and the enlightening scriptures.
That is why I punished them. What a terrible punishment they had to face.
Do they not see that it is God Who sends down water for them from the sky [and they respond this favor of Him with denying Him!]. Then it is God Who brings forth a variety of fruits with different colors [which the disbelievers eat and then deny Him!] The same God has created the mountains too in different colors: different layers of white, red, intense black as well as other colors with different shades.
It is God Who creates the human beings, the animals and the livestock in different colors. Only the knowledgeable servants of God respect Him [through pondering upon His Creation]. God is Almighty, the Most Forgiving.
Those who read the Qur’an, worship God regularly and devote a part of their God given income to charity (openly or secretly) are engaged in a business which surely has no loss.
God will fully reward them and shower them many times out of His Grace. God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Appreciative.
God is the One Who has revealed this Qur’an to you which is the same eternal truth preached by all Prophets. God knows His servants [better than they know themselves] and watches over everything [therefore, God is the only One Who knows and reveals nothing but the truth.]
Then I made the chosen servants of mine [the Muslims] to become the heirs to this great book. Among them [the Muslims] you will find some who are unjust to their soul, some who are half obedient and some who [have deserved to] have received the assistance of God in becoming wholeheartedly devoted to the good deeds, which is the supreme success.
They will enter to live permanently in the gardens where they will be dressed with the silk cloths and carry gold and pearl bracelets.
They will express their gratitude by saying: “Thank you Lord for relieving our [worldly] worries; God is indeed Forgiving and Generous.”
“God, out of His Grace, has admitted us in an eternal residence where we will never get bored or tired.”
As for the disbelievers, they will be constantly thrown into the Hellfire. Their punishment will never be reduced and they will never die [which will be a blessing for them.] This is the way that your Lord deals with those who chose the disbelief.
Therein they will beg: “Our Lord, please give us a second chance so that we engage in good deeds to cover our wrong doings.” The reply will be: “Did I not give you a lifelong chance? Did I not sent you a Warner? Did I not warned you enough with My Revelations? Now taste what you have sown; there is no help for the wrongdoers here.”
God is aware of every (open or secret) thing that takes place in the universe and the earth. He is aware of all innermost thoughts.
God is the One Who has appointed you as His representative on earth [to take care of life on earth.] Now whoever chooses to disbelieve [and resign from such a high position and disturb the life on earth say for personal profit], does so to his detriment. The disbelief does not lead to prosperity; it simply brings the curse of God. The only thing that the disbelievers will obtain is a great loss.
Ask them: “Have you ever considered those whom you worship instead of God? What have they created in the earth and in the other planets? Do they have any written book from God [in which it is written that such and such boss can guarantee their job, that such and such woman can guarantee their happiness, that such and such sum of money can offer them security, etc.] to justify their disbelief in the Oneness of God? What the wicked ones are promising to each other is nothing but an illusion.
God is the Only One Who sustains the heavens and the earth. If God holds His support, there is none to stop the destruction of the whole universe. God is indeed Patient and Forgiving.
The disbelievers used to swear to join the religion of God, if it is purified out of its man made amendments. But when a Prophet was sent to them with the authentic/ original religion of God, they plainly refused it!
They even turned to more vicious people as they started to recourse to evil plans; not knowing that the evil plan will backfire. What else do they expect but the fate of those who rejected the previous Prophets? Do they think that God’s way of dealing with the disbelievers will change? No, you will never find a change in the God ordained procedure. God’s laws are unchangeable.
Do they not take a field trip in the history to see what happened to the nations even stronger than them? There is none in the heavens and the earth to challenge God. God has knowledge over everything and has power over everything.
If God wanted to punish every one for his sins, not a single creature would have remained on earth. Instead, God gives a life-long time to the people so that [they have the opportunity to purify themselves and] when the Day of Resurrection arrives, they stand in front of their Lord.
Y. S.
I (God ) swear by the Qur’an that is full of Wisdom.
Most surely You are one of the Messengers.
[To guide the people] on a straight path.
(Qur’an is) a revelation sent down by the Mighty and the Merciful (God.)
To warn (these) people whose fathers had received no warning (since Abraham/ Ishmael) and therefore they are unaware.
Although our message is proven to be true to most of them, still they do not believe.
(they do not realize that in account of their disobedience) I have already put chains on their necks up to their chins (in hereafter) which prevent them lowering their heads.
In account of a barrier placed by Me around them, they can not see (the truth.)
And it is useless if you present Islam to them, they are already deprived of the faculty of grasping (the truth.) and they will not believe.
You can only strengthen the faith of those who follow My words and are at Awe with Me even when they are alone in their privacy; give them good news of my forgiveness and a most generous reward.
Indeed I will summon you to Me after your earthly life and will show you all your recorded actions; you will see the reaction (even after your death) of all your good/ bad deeds which will affect your reward.
(Mohammad) remind them of the events followed by My sending two Messengers to a town.
When people did not believe them I re-enforced them with a third Messenger (out of mercy.) saying we are indeed sent to you by Lord.
They said: “You are nothing but human beings like us and God, the most Gracious has not sent anything through you and you are surely liars.”
They replied: “By God, He knows that we are His Messengers.”
And our mission is to relay His message to you.
People said: “We consider you bad omens and if you do not stop this nonsense we will either stone you or punish you in a horrible manner.”
They said: “Your evil fortune is with you as you do not listen to God’s message; indeed you are evils people.”
At this very moment a man ran toward them from afar saying: “My fellow citizens follow God’s Messengers.”
“Follow them as they do not ask any reward from you as they are the followers of the right path.”
“Why should I not submit myself to the One who created me and to Him you will eventually return?”
“How should I believe in other gods while they cannot make any intercession on my behalf or save me, if God wants to punish me?”
“I will be totally wrong by doing so.”
“Surely I believe in the Lord of you all; please hear me.”
When he was told (at the moment of his death) : “Enter the Paradise”, he said “I wish my people would see me now”
“That my Lord has forgiven me and has put me in rank with honored ones.”
I (God) did not sent any army to challenge his people after his death. It was not necessary to do such a thing.
A single blast was more than enough to destroy them all.
What a pity. Every time a Prophet was sent to them, they made fun of him.
Don’t they know how many nations before them were punished to the extinction?
One day they will stand up in front of Me.
Look at the dead land around you that God brings it to life and produces the very food that you eat [how can you eat the food produced of a dead land and say it is impossible to bring a dead thing back to life?] 
I let the gardens of date-palms and grape grow in the resurrected dead land and bring forth gushing springs therein.
It is not the fruit of their own labor that they eat [no matter how hard one tries, the dead land will produce nothing]; How ungrateful they are [to eat what God has produced for them and then deny it!]
Glorified is the One Who created every kind of vegetables and animals [including the disbelievers] in male and female as well as other creatures that they do not even know about their existence
Another natural phenomenon [that man takes for granted due to its daily happening] is the night that God spreads over the earth [just imagine how fast God has to rotate the earth so that the night prevails.]
Another sign of [the existence and the greatness of] God is the sun [as big as 1,earth] which God makes it move toward its [final] destiny.
Look at the moon which God has designed it to appear in different stages.
God has put such an impeccable order in the nature that neither sun can overtake the moon nor the night to outstrip the day. Everything is gliding in its predetermined order in the universe.
Yet another sign [of the existence and the greatness] of God is that I carried your ancestors in a heavily loaded vessel.
I also made similar vessels for them on which they ride.
I decide to destroy their vessels, none can rescue them (remember Titanic and Space Shuttle’s destruction.)
Instead, I shower them with my mercy and let them live till the day that they are supposed to live their bodies.
When the disbelievers are told: “Be mindful of what is awaiting you and what deeds you have left behind” [they do not care.]
When the Revelations of their Lord reaches them, they turn away from it.
When they are asked to devote a part of what God has given them to the needy ones, they say: “If God wanted, He would have helped the needy ones Himself!” What a wrong attitude [God has made some poor and some rich to see whether or not the rich ones are human enough to help the poor.]
They [jokingly] say: “When will this Resurrection of yours take place?”
The blast will take them at a blink of an eye while they are engaged in their silly worldly deals.
It will happen so fast that they will not have time to make a will or bid farewell to their folks.
When the horn is blown, they will rise from their graves herded to stand in front of their Lord.
They will say: “Pity on us; indeed the word of God was nothing but the truth. He roused up from our sleeping place; indeed the Prophets were truthful in warning us.”
Yes; there shall be only a single loud blast and they will be presented before Me, all together.
On that Day no soul will get the least injustice; every person will be rewarded according to what he has done during his worldly life.
On that Day, those who end up in Paradise will be busy with so many joyful things.
They will enjoy the comfortable shade of the trees, reclined in luxurious furnishings, accompanied by their wives.
They will be served delicious fruits and anything they wish.
They will receive their Lord’s salutations.
As to you the disbelievers, step aside from the successful ones.
Did you, the children of Adam, not promises Me not to follow the Satan; your open enemy?
Did you not promises to obey Me, i.e., staying in the right path?
Did you not have common sense to see what a great number of you he had already misled?
*Now it is time to face the Hell that you have been promised.
Today you will be burnt in what you used to deny its existence.
On that Day, I will seal their mouth and let their hands and feet testify for their wrongdoings [in today’s terminology, they will silently watch the video of their actions.]
I may decide to put a veil on their eyes so that they do not see where they are being herded.
I may decide to freeze them so that they stay motionless; not being able to move around.
Do you not realize that when God gives someone a long life, He reduces his overall capabilities in old age? So, do not obey someone in account of a respect for his age as he may have childish brain.]
Know that Qur’an is not a work of poetry. Neither Mohammad is a poet. It is revealed to serve as an easy to understand book of profound value.
Qur’an is revealed to guide every living person [who is not thoughtless and motionless like a statue] to the right path and to disclose the irrationality of the disbelievers.
[How can they deny the Lord?] Do they not realize that God Himself has created the livestock that they own?
These are the same animals that I have subdued for them so that they can ride on them and eat their meat.
These animals offer them so much benefits. Why are they not grateful to their Lord?
They [eat their Lord provided food and] worship other than God; hoping that what they worship will help them!
Whatever they worship [idols, money, boss, spouse, etc.] can not help them; yet they stand as an ever ready army at their service!
Never mind them, I (God) know them inside out.
Do these disbelievers not think about their creation. I created them from an insignificant sperm drop and now [that I have showered them with my blessings] they dare to challenge their Lord like an enemy of theirs?
Forgetting [the power of God in] their own creation they ask: “Who has the power to resurrect us while our bones are rotten?”
Tell them: “The One Who created you at first place is capable to recreate you.”
“The One Who creates fire for you from a green branch of the tree.”
Is the One Who has created the earth and the universes capable of re-creating the same? Yes; He is the skilful Creator.”
Any time that He wants to create something He simply says “Be” and here it is.
Glorified is the One Who has absolute control over everything and to Him you will all be returned.
God hereby swears by those who form their ranks to start the battle.
And by the angles who are in charge of driving the clouds
And by the angles who bring the verses of Qur’an down to mankind
That your God is One and that there is Only One God.
Director of the heavens and the earth and anything between and Lord of the easts [perhaps a reference to the easts and wests and global shapes of the planets].
I (God) have adorned the innermost universe [the one being discovered by astronomy] with exotic planets.
I have guarded it against any evil devil [to destroy its existing order.]
These satans cannot break into the communication system of those who are close to God as they are on defensive.
They have already been condemned to an everlasting torture.
If one of them dares to escape the lower universe, a flashing projectile will be charged against him.
Vs.11-deals with the following question: “Is it difficult for God to recreate man to face the Day of Judgment?”
Ask the disbelievers, who are created from the mud [organic matter]: “Are they more difficult for God to be recreated [on the Day of Resurrection] or the awesome realm of creation?”
While the believers are at awe [with God’s creative power], the disbelievers making fun [of the possibility of Resurrection.]
When the disbelievers are warned, they take it lightly.
When a revelation of God comes to the disbelievers they recourse to the mockery.
They say: “This is nonsense ….
that we will be raised with bone and flesh after our death.”
They jokingly ask: “How about our ancestors?”
Say to them, “absolutely; and you are helpless [on that Day that you are laughing at its happening.]
It will take a snap for them to be recreated and look around [and face the Day of Resurrection.]
Then they will say: “Shame and pity to us; this is indeed the Day of Judgment.”
It will be confirmed to them: “Yes, this is the same Day of Judgment that you used to deny.”
Then it will be commanded: “Gather all the unjust people and their associates and those idols that they used to worship, instead of God, and drag them in the road that leads to Hell.”
“Then take a break and ask why they are not helping each other [as they were used to say:….
“Do not worry, I will take the responsibility”.”
Of course on that Day they will all submit [but it will be too late.]
That will be an opportunity for mutual blaming.
The followers will ask their leaders: “You used to swear that you were our well-wisher [and that in an improbable Day of Judgment you will carry our sins.]”
The leaders will reply: “[Do not blame us.] You yourself chose the disbelief.”
[They will continue]: “We did not have any power over you; it was you who chose the rebellion.”
“The Lord’s Judgment against us was just; now we have to accept the punishment.”
“We offered you the disbelief for the simple reason that we had chosen the disbelief ourselves.”
Thus on that Day the disbelievers and their followers will be sentenced to punishment.
This is the way that I deal with the disbelievers [that being misled is not an acceptable excuse].
These are the same people that when they were told: “There is no other god beside God”, they revealed their arrogant nature.
They used to say: “Shall we give up our gods for the sake of a crazy poet [as they referred to Mohammad.]”
While he (Mohammad) had come with the truth [as presented by the Prophets before him and nothing of new], confirming the truthfulness of the previous Prophets [who had repeated the same message again and again before Mohammad.]
It will be said to the disbelievers: “You deserve to taste the awful punishment.”
“Your punishment is proportionate to your deeds.”
Only the sincere worshippers of God will be saved.
They deserve the blessing which is in reserve for them.
All kind of fruits will be at their disposition and they will be honored.
In the Gardens of Paradise.
They will sit face to face in luxurious couches.
They will be offered cups of pure drinks.
How delightful will be those drinks.
The kind of a drink which will neither harm you nor make you intoxicated.
They will be married to the chaste women with shy beautiful eyes.
As delicate as an egg under its shell.
Then they will engage in conversation.
One of them will say:…
“I had a friend [in my previous life on earth] who used to make fun of me asking if believe in this “nonsense” ….
of being resurrected and judged after our death and after our bones being turn into dust.”
He will be said: “watch [perhaps in an interactive kind of device].”
He will see his friend at the bottom of the Hell.
Then he will start to communicate with him saying: “By Lord! you were too close in convincing me to follow you in disbelief.”
“How grateful I am to my Lord who led me to the right path.”
“Now you tell me whether or not the death is the end of everything and that….
there will not be any judgment for our worldly deeds.”
Being admitted to Paradise is….
the greatest success that everyone should strive for.
Is the feast of Paradise [as explained before] better or eating the bitter fruit of….
the devilish tree of “zaqqum” given to the wicked one?
Zaqqum is the name of a tree which grown at the bottom of the Hell.
With devilish looking buds.
Forced by hunger, the people of Hell [who do not have nothing else to eat] will fill up their bellies with this devilish fruit.
Then they will top it with a disgusting boiling drink.
Once the eating “break” is over, they will be herded back to the Hell.
These are the same people who followed their traditional religions.
Knowing that their religion was keeping them in the wrong path [, they were not brave enough to break up with their wrong beliefs].
Their wrong religions were established by those before them to whom God sent….
warnings through His Prophets.
Now see how terrible is the destiny of those who rejected God’s warnings.
Only those who sincerely devoted themselves to worship the Lords are saved.
[Long before them] Noah [at the height of his desperation and after having invited people to the way of God for some years,] called upon Me. Note what a positive response he got from his Lord.
I (God) saved him and his followers from the great catastrophe.
And established them on the earth.
And left for him praise among generations to come.
Peace is with Noah forever [as none will ever talk evil of him].
This is the way that your Lord rewards the righteous.
Noah is indeed one of My believing servants.
As to the wicked of Noah’s nation, I drowned them all.
Abraham was one of the followers of Noah.
He submitted whole heartedly to his Lord.
He said to his father and his people: “What are these things that you worship?”
“Do you recourse to the gods that you yourself have fabricated instead of God?”
“What do you think about the Organizer of the universe?”
[As he could not get any convincing answer,] Abraham concentrated his attention toward the stars [to find what he was missing].
Being disappointed,] he said: “I feel bad.”
So they left him alone and went [to some kind of general gathering.]
[At their absence,] Abraham went to the temple and [started to talk to the idols and] said: “Do you want something to eat?”
Then he asked: “How come you do not talk?”
Then he strokes them down with his right hand [with a sword or a weapon of some kind.]
[When people returned, they concluded that the only present one in the city, i.e., Abraham could have destroyed their gods so] they rushed toward Abraham [asking in rage why he has done it.]
Abraham said: “Why do you worship something that you have carved with your own hands?”
“Whereas it is God who [should be worshipped as He is the One Who has] created you and whatever you make”
They said: “Let us make a big fire and throw him in [and see how his God will save him.]
They plotted a plan against him and God defeated them in their own plan [as the fire did not have any effect upon Abraham.]
Then Abraham said: “Now I am leaving you, putting my trust in God.”
One day Abraham prayed: “O Lord, grant me a righteous son.”
God [answered his prayers in appropriate time and] gave him the good news: a wonderful son.
When the boy grew up, one day Abraham told him: “My son, I have seen in my dream that I am sacrificing you; what do you think about it?” The son said: “My dear father, do whatever God has ordered you to do. God willing, I will bear in this process.”
When they both submitted [to what they were thinking is the Lord’s order]…..
and Abraham started to slaughter his son, I (God) called out:….
“O Abraham, you fulfilled what you saw in your dream [he saw that he is sacrificing not that he has sacrificed]. Thus I reward the righteous [by not letting them being hurt in their trials.]
This was indeed a great test.
Then I asked them to sacrifice an animal.
Praise is for Abraham for generations to come [as millions of people gather every year in celebration of the event where it took place.]
Peace is with Abraham.
This is the way that God rewards the righteous.
Abraham was indeed one of My believing servants.
Then I gave Abraham the good news of the upcoming birth of Isaac; a righteous Prophet to be.
I blessed Abraham and Isaac. Now among their offspring some are righteous and some are wicked.
I also blessed Moses and Aaron.
I delivered them and their people from a great distress (Pharaoh’s slavery.)
I supported them till they succeeded.
I revealed to them the scriptures.
And guided them to the right path.
Praise is for them both for generations to come.
Peace is with Moses and Aaron.
This is the way that God rewards the righteous.
They were indeed among my believing servants.
Elias was also one of My Prophets.
He invited his people to be righteous.
He said: “How do you dare to worship an idol known as Ba’al instead of the Supreme Creator?”
“God is your Lord as well as the Lord of your forefathers.”
The people of Elias did not listen to him; therefore, they will be called to answer for their disbelief.
Except those among them who served God whole heartedly.
Praise is for Elias for generations to come.
Peace is with Elias and his followers.
This is the way that God rewards the righteous.
Elias was indeed one of our believing servants.
Lot also was a Prophets.
I saved him and his household from the disaster [which overtook his people].
Except [his] old ugly woman who had to be punished [for not obeying him].
The rest were completely destroyed.
You pass by their ruins [when you travel] by day and night; ….
will you not take a lesson.
Jonah was also one of My Prophets.
Once he escaped [from a predicament] by taking refuge in a loaded ship.
[Due to the overweight, they had to throw some people out.] He agreed to participate in the casting of lots and lost.
Eventually a big fish swallowed him and he was the only one to be blamed for his destiny [as he fled his place of mission without asking God’s permission].
If it was not in account of his sincere recourse to God,….
he would have stayed in the belly of the fish till the Day of Resurrection.
I ordered him to be thrown out in a bare shore; absolutely exhausted.
I ordered a fruit tree to grow so that he may eat from its fruit.
Then I appointed him as a Prophet to a nation of some hundred thousand people.
As they chose to believe in him, we let them live [comfortably] until the day that they were supposed to face their natural deaths. The next few verses deals with the man’s attributing children to God in account of his ignorance.
Ask the disbelievers: “How come you want to have only sons [and kill your daughter considering having them a matter of shame] and then you say that God has daughters?”
Why do they say that the angels are of female gender? Were they present in their creation?
Saying that God has begotten a son is an insult to the God’s dignity. …
Such people are nothing but plain liars.
Has God begotten a girl instead of a son?…
What is wrong with these people?
Why don’t they use their brain before saying something of such blasphemy magnitude?
Do they have any logical proof for their assigning children to God?
Bring your book [the book in which it is written God has begotten children] as a proof if you are not a bunch of liars.
They even [fantasize and] say that there is a blood relationship between God and the Extra-Terrestrials (Jinns); though Jinns know very well that they are the creatures of the Lord.
Glory to God Who is far above their descriptions.
Only those servants of God who have devoted themselves wholeheartedly to him are in the right path.
Indeed the disbelievers (and whatever they worship) …
can not over power the Lord….
and will all be burnt in the Hell.
The Angels declare:….
“[Not to speak of being God’s children], we all have our ranks. ….
We are the ranged servant and the glorifiers of God”
The Disbelievers used to say:
“Had we received the correct (authentic/pure and nothing added to) guidance from….
the previous generations, We would have been sincere worshippers of God.”
Now that their wish is granted to them, they prefer to continue their way of disbelief.
My decision is already….
revealed to My Prophets: They will have the final victory.
Victory belongs to the soldiers of God.
So (Mohammad), leave them alone for a while.
And look forward to [their punishment] as they are looking forward to also.
Why do they want to face [as they jokingly used to ask Mohammad to hasten] their punishment as soon as possible?
It will be a miserable Day when they face their punishment. They are sufficiently warned.
So leave them alone for a while.
And look forward to as they are looking forward to also.
Glorified is your Lord, Lord of Honor and far above their claims [of having a child, not being able to recreate them, having partners, etc.]
My salutations to the Prophets.
All praise is only for God; the Lord of the universe.
S; Hereby God swears by Qur’an which is full of admonition.
The reason for which Qur’an is being rejected is because of the false pride and hard headiness of the disbelievers.
How many nations before them I (God) destroyed. At the time of their doom they cried for mercy but it was too late.
They wonder how is it possible that a person from among themselves is being appointed as a messenger to them to relay the word of God. They say that Mohammad is a lying sorcerer!
Mohammad has come with the idea of One God instead of so many gods that we have! What a weird idea!
The chief of the disbelievers running around saying: “Go ahead and worship your gods; for sure Mohammad has a hidden agenda behind his invitation.”
“If he is right, how come we have not heard anything similar from our ascendants? He is surely fabricating all this”
“How come he is the only one that God has sent upon His admonitions?” The fact of the matter is they are in doubt about Mohammad’s divine mission as they have not tasted My (God’s) punishment.
Who in the heaven these disbelievers think they are to decide who should be sent to them as the Lord’s messenger? Do they think that they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Mightiest, the Most Generous?
Or perhaps they think that they own the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. If so, then let them mount up to the throne with ropes!
These disbelievers are only a small group of disbelievers who will be drawn here to meet their miserable destiny.
Before them, there were other disbelievers such as people of Noah, people of Ad and people of mighty pharaoh.
Among other disbelievers were people of Thamud, people of Lot and people of Aiykan.
All the above mentioned people denied their prophets and, therefore, deserved My (God’s) punishment.
Today’s disbelievers, too, deserve a single blast enough for their annihilation [so that they get no more relief.]
The [foolish] disbelievers mockingly say: “Our Lord, why wait for the Day of Judgment? send down our punishment now!”
Be patient with them and recite the story of our servant David [to strengthen your patience and as a lesson to the disbelievers who have falsified his life story]. He was blessed with power and turned to God in every matter.
He was given the authority to order the mountains to join him in praising the Lord every morning and every evening.
The birds too would join him in praise.
I gave him a secure and strong nation to rule and blessed him with the faculty of sound justice.
Have you heard this story of David [which is mentioned in Samuel, ch.1-9 in a false manner] when two men climbed the wall in order to talk to him in private?
At first he was frightened to see the two strangers in his private quarters. They said: “Do not be afraid; we are here just for your judgment. Be fair and guide us to the right path.”
One of them said: “This brother of mine owns ship and I own only one. Now he is asking me to give him my only ship [as he can take better care of it!]”
David said: “This person is definitely wrong. In fact the people who live together are prone to be unjust to each other save a few believer who are extremely righteous.” David suddenly realized that he himself has been tried by this case [as he had asked Uriah to divorce his wife and let David add her to the list of his wives.] David then fell down prostrate and begged his Lord for forgiveness for his wrong intention.
Then I (God) forgave David and he [unlike what they have presented him as an adulterous/ murderer in the existing version of the Bible] is one of the closest to Me and has an excellent place in Paradise.
[Then his Lord commanded:] “ O David, I have made you My representative in the earth, so rule among the people with justice and do not follow your lust, for it will deviate you from the path of God.” For those who deviate from the path of God, there is an awful punishment because they did not take the Day of judgment seriously.
I (God) have not created the heavens, the earth and anything between in vain [so that you play any game without worrying about its consequences.] This is the fancy of those who have chosen to disbelieve. Pity to such disbelievers who will end up in Hellfire.
Should I (God) treat those who believe and do good deeds like those who spread evil in the earth? Should I treat the pious and the sinners equally?
This Qur’an is a blessed book [in the sense that it is highly useful for man] that I have sent to you so that these people may reflect over its verses; the intelligent ones will learn lessons from it.
I granted a son to David known as Solomon who was a role servant of Mine returning to his Lord over and over.
One day he became pre-occupied with nice horses all afternoon [which caused a delay in saying his regular afternoon prayers].
Blaming himself] he said: “I enjoyed material things more that the remembrance of my Lord.”
Then [When he finished worshipping God,] he said: “Bring them back to me [to bid farewell]” and he rubbed their legs and necks [some say he sacrificed them to show that he likes God more than his most favorite belongings.]
This is the way that I put Solomon to test; [unlike Job being tested with poverty] with vast material wealth [and he did not forget God’s regular worshipping while being extremely wealthy from any point of view.] I put a mere body on his throne [probably reference to an out of body experience.]
Then he turned to me in prayer saying: “My Lord, I beg you to forgive my wrongdoings. I also wish that you grant me a kingdom impossible to atop after me [making me the most powerful king ever to be] ; indeed you are the grantor of wishes.”
I [granted his wish and as a mean of the power] subdued the winds to him so that he may direct them anywhere he wants [and water that place.]
I (God) also imprisoned for him the mean extraterrestrials (Jinns) who [with their advanced technology] would build whatever he wanted and dive for him [to extract the treasures of the seas.]
They were all at his disposal.
I told him: “This is your provision. You may share it with the others or you may keep it all to yourself as you wish.”
Indeed [in account of his behavior] he is honored to be close to me and a wonderful place to live in.
Now mention [the other extreme which is the case of] My servant Job who [at the height of his misery] turned to Me imploring: “Satan [is taking advantage of my misery and] tempting me to turn against my Lord.”
I [decided enough testing in poverty is enough and] told him: “Strike the ground with your foot; a spring will appear for the pleasure of your drinking and healing [your terrible skin disease.]”
Then I restored to him his family and twice as much as he had lost [for his test in this world.] Such is God’s mercy; a reminder for those who [use their brain to] think.
Now instead of beating [your wife who has shown weakness at the height of your trial in the misery], as you have sworn to your Lord, use only weak straws to strike [as a symbol of fulfilling your oath.] I found him patient and an excellent servant of mine who returned to Me over and over again.
Mention also our servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They were resourceful and men of vision.
I chose to purify them in account of their concentration of their efforts towards the Hereafter.
They were chosen because of their righteousness.
Mention also Ishmael, Elisha [see I Kings, 19,: 15-also the Second Book of the Kings Chs. 2-about his life] and Duhl-Kifl [see EN of Maududi’s translation of Ch. of Qur’an]. They were righteous too.
These Prophets are among the righteous ones who earned their wonderful destiny.
The Gardens of Eden will open up their gates for them.
Relaxing in Paradise they will be offered many kind of fruits and drinks.
They will marry the modest young ladies.
This is what I have promised for the righteous ones…
in the Day of Judgment: an endless goodies.
For the wrongdoers, there will be the most terrible place.
They will burn in Hell. What a miserable place to end up in.
They will be given boiling water….
and stinky pus-blood type of drinks.
When a new group arrives, there will be no welcoming. Only an announcement: “Here is a new group to be burned with you.” They have deserved to burn in the Hellfire.
The new comers will complain to the Hell’s residents: “You deviated us from the right path to this end. You deserve to suffer like this.”
They will pray: “O Lord double the punishment of those who misled us to the Fire.”
They will say to each other: “How come we do not find any of those [believers] whom we were calling names?”
“Is it possible that we were wrong at mocking at them or it is only due to our bad eye-sight that we do not see them?”
This is a fact: The inmates of Fire will engage in such kind of dialogue.
Tell people: “I am nothing but a Warner. There is no deity but God, the One, the All-Mighty.”
God is the Master of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He is the Most High, the Most Forgiving.
(Mohammad) say: “This [Qur’an in general and the followings in particular] is a great news (source of information).”
“That you avoid it!” (How can one be objective and completely eliminate Qur’an in Theological discussions?)
Say: “I (Mohammad) did not know nothing about the time when the big dispute (as explained below) was taking place among those with high ranks.”
“I (Mohammad) am informed about all these through divine revelation and my only mission is to relay the message to you (that is why in Islam the Prophets are referred to as Messengers).
Your Lord said to the Angels: “I am going to create [the body of] a human being from clay (the matter).”
“Once finished, I will bring him into life by blowing My Spirit into him (man’s source of energy, therefore, is divine). Then you prostrate yourself before him.”
All Angels fell prostrate before man.
Except Satan who was arrogant and unappreciative [of God’s best creation].
The Lord said: “O Satan, what prevented you from prostrating [as a sign of appreciation] yourself before the one whom I created directly? Is it beneath your dignity [to obey your Lord]?
Satan replied: “I am better than him; you created man from the matter while I am made of fire (pure energy).”
The Lord said: “Get out of My Sight as you lost your high rank.”
“My curse is with you till the Day of Judgment [when you will be sentenced.]
The Satan said: “then give me a break till the Day of resurrection.”
The Lord said: “You will get a relief…
until that Day.”
The Satan said: “I swear by your majesty that I will entice all men to disobedience.”
“Only your devote worshipper will escape me.”
God said: “This is [a part of] the truth….
The [whole] truth is that I will fill Hell with you and whoever that will follow you.”
Mohammad, say: “I am not asking any fee for this warning [of such importance] as I am not an imposter.”
“What I say is a reminder from God to the whole humanity.”
“Whether you believe me or not, you will see it yourself soon.”
This book is revealed from God All Mighty, the Wisest.
I (God) have sent down this Book (that contains nothing but the truth) to you to invite you to worship none but God and be sincere in your religion.
God’s religion is the purest way of life. Those who worship more than One God (worshipping wealth, position, lust, saints, idols, etc.) saying we pray to them (as our mediators) so that they bring us closer to God, they will be judged by their Lord for what they differed in with the believers. God will not guide those who lie and cover the fact.
If God had wanted to own a son, the only possibility would have been to choose someone whom He has created [It is impossible that the creator should have begotten a son]. Glory to God Who is One and the Most Powerful.
The Almighty is the One Who has created the heavens and the earth as a reality [and not as an illusion]. He rolls [the globe so that the] night over the day and the day over the night. The Creator has subjected the sun and the moon to move toward their destiny. God is the Almighty. [If He wants, He can punish you but] He is the Most Forgiving.
God is the One Who created you from a single person, then created from him his mate. God is the One Who has created four different pairs of livestock [goat, sheep, camel and cow]. He is the One Who lets you pass through several stage of creation in the womb of your mother in the darkness of the three envelopes. Such is God your Lord. He is the supreme authority. There is no deity but God. To who else then you are turning to?
Your disbelief can not degrade God, yet [for your own sake and out of His love] He does not want to see you in disbelief. If you choose to belief, however, He is happy for you. Know that no soul is responsible for the sin of another soul. To God is your ultimate return when He will play back your deeds. Know that God knows even the innermost of your thoughts.
When an average man is in trouble, he remembers God and starts to pray. When God saves him from the trouble, then he forgets the Lord and worships other things [money, boss, women, etc.] and misleads others too. tell to such a person: “Enjoy your temporary disbelief as you have earned the Hellfire.”
Is it not better to be one of those who devote a part of their nights to meditation and worshipping their Lords in the state of standing and prostration? Such people are aware of the Hereafter and seek the mercy of their Lord. Ask them: “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” Only men of understanding listen to learn.
O’ Mohammad, say to my believing servants: “Always keep God in mind with the utmost respect. there is a good reward for those who choose righteousness. God’s earth is vast. [Emigrate to another place, if you are subject to persecution.] Those who endure hardship with patience [and practice their belief], will receive a limitless reward.”
O’ Mohammad, say: “I have been ordered to worship God and strictly practice His ordained religion.”
“I am commanded to be the most devote submitter.”
O’ Mohammad, Say: “I am terrified of the consequences of disobeying my Lord that will catch up with me on the Day of Judgment.”
Say: “I worship none but God and follow His ordained religion to the point.”
As for you, you may worship whoever you choose. Say: “The real losers are those who find their souls, as well as their families’ souls, lost on the Day of Judgment. Know that this is real failure”
The Fire will surround them from the above and from the beneath. God thus warns His servants of the awful consequence of their wrongdoings. O My servants be mindful of your Lord.”
Those who avoid worshipping false deities and devote themselves totally to their Lord alone, for them there is a good news.
Let those who listen to the word of God and follow it to the point, know that they are the ones whom God has blessed with His guidance and have been given the faculty of understanding.
Who can save the person who has already been sentenced to be thrown into the Fire?
As to those who show the utmost respect to their Lord, they will live in high rises beneath which the water flows. This is God’s promise: God never breaks His promise.
Do you not contemplate in God’s sending down water from the sky, depositing it under the ground, making it flow in the earth in the form of springs, fountains and rivers, letting a variety of plants to use it and to grow and eventually reducing them to nothing but straw? Indeed there is a lesson in this for the men of intelligence [who may detect the transitory nature of the life on earth and its dependency on God’s favor.]
Consider two individuals: one has earned the favor of God’s guidance toward Islam and walking in a lighted path, the other one having earned God’s displeasure and deprived of His guidance. Are these two people equal? Indeed there is no hope for the latter.
God has sent down the best communication of thoughts; a book which is consistent and reminds its main message again and again. Those who respect their Lord, are filled with awe when they hear it; their whole body melts down and submit to the Lord. This book is the guidance of God through which He guides whoever He wishes [and deserve] to the right path. As for those who [deserve to be and] are deprived of God’s guidance, there is no hope for them at all.
You can not even imagine the desperation of the one who is being sentenced to the punishment on the Day of Judgment. To such wrongdoer it will be said: “Taste now [the fruit of ] what you have sowed.
Many a people before them also chose to disobey. They got what they deserved when they least expect it.
God disgraced and humiliated them [as a lesson for those to come] with His punishment. Their greatest punishment, however, has yet to come; if they only knew.
I (God) have cited in this Qur’an any kind of example to make people think.
Qur’an is revealed in a straight forward Arabic to avoid any misinterpretation; may the righteous ones refer to it for the guidance.
God hereby cites the following example: “Is the one who is pulled by contradictory orders in peace or the one who receives only consistent order from one source?” [In other words, who is more rational in discussion? the one who refers to contradicting sources or the one who uses nonambiguous Qur’an as his source of reference?]. Praise be to God. What a pity that most of them do not get it.
You (Mohammad) will die, just like they will die.
Your dispute then will come to the conclusion on the Day of Judgment before your Lord.
Who is more unjust than the one who attributes a lie to God and covering a truth send to him by God? Is there any place better for him to live in than the Hell?
As for those who chose to believe and spread the truth, they are righteous.
Their Lord will give them whatever they wish. Such is the way God rewards the righteous ones.
God will overlook their wrongdoings and reward their good deeds.
Is God not enough for His servant to turn to? The disbelievers frighten you with the “rage” of the false deities; the fact of the matter is: non can guide the one who has been condemned by his Lord to get lost.
It is also true that the one that deserved to be guided by God will never get lost. is there anyone who doubts the might and justice of God?
If you ask people: “who created the heavens and the earth?”, they will say “God”. Ask them then: “Why do you worship other things beside God?” Say: “If God decides to afflict me with a trouble, non can save me and if He decides to bless me with a favor, non can take it from me. Why should then I worships others beside God? Say: “God is enough for me and He is the One that the believers trust in.”
Say to disbelievers: “Do your best and I will do mine.”
“Pretty soon we will see which one of us will be humiliated with an everlasting punishment.”
I (God) have sent down this Qur’an through you (Mohammad) for the whole humanity. The one who recourse to it for guidance has done a favor to himself and the one who chooses the darkness has ruined himself. You (Mohammad) are not responsible for none.
God is the One Who summons the souls at the time of the death. God also takes your souls away when you go to sleep. Then He restores it back at His Will and let you live as long as He has predestined or may decide not to restore it at all and let you die at bed. There is a food for thought in this for those who possess the intelligence.
[Man’s next minute’s life thus being determined by God,] How silly of people who have invented intermediaries to ask God’s mercy through them. Say to them: “What if these intercessors of them lack the power and the intelligence?”
Let them know that: “God is the only intercessor.” The Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to God. To God you will all return.
When the discussion centers only around the Lord, those who disbelieve in Hereafter become upset; but when the others’ name is added to the prayer, they become delighted.
Say: “O Lord, Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knowledgeable of the secrets of the tangible and intangible universe. You are the Only One Who will judge between us in what we differ in.”
If the wrongdoers owned every valuable thing on earth (or even twice as much), on the Day of Judgment they would have willingly offered it to escape their punishment when they will be shown by God what they would have never imagined to happen to them.
Their wrongdoings will be played back to them and the very thing that they used to laugh at will backfire at them.
Most men pray to God when at need. Once God gives them what they want, they say: “I earned it in account of my hard work and know-how.” The fact of the matter is their possessions are means of trial for them [to see how they will behave and use it] yet they do not understand it.
The ones before them had similar conviction but their “earnings” was not of any help [for the simple token that it was God’s blessing and not their earning] them in the least. [when will man learn from history?]
The ones before them faced the consequences of their evil deeds and the wicked ones of today also shall soon face the evil consequences of their deeds. None can escape God.
Does man not understand the wisdom of God’s distribution of wealth? [The Lord gives more to some and less to the others not because of their worthiness, ability, being favored or being disgraced by God. Just in order to try them in wealth and in poverty so that they learn how to behave in a righteous manner in any economic situation.]
Proclaim: “O you who worship me; if you have committed indecencies, never despair of God’s mercy. God forgives all sins [the conditions being mentioned all over the Qur’an: sincere repentance.] God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
Return to your Lord and submit to Him before being sentenced to punishment. Once sentenced, you will get no help from any source.
Follow the best path indicated by your Lord before unexpectedly, and not knowingly, being exposed to the disaster.
Do not be among those who will say: “Alas for taking the Lord’s commandments lightly and mocking at them.”
Do not be among those who will say: “I wish God had guided me so that I too would have been among His righteous servants.”
Do not be among those who will face the fire and then will say: “I wish I had another chance to devote my life to do nothing but the good deeds.”
Such people will be told: “Yes indeed [you did get enough chances.] My revelations reached you but you chose to deny them; you showed arrogance and joined the disbelievers.”
On the Day of Resurrection you will see the faces of those who spread false rumors about God covered with misery. Is Hell not an appropriate place for the arrogant people?
And God will save the righteous ones in account of their recourses to the means of success. No evil will touch them and they will never grieve.
God is the Creator of everything and in absolute control of His creation.
To God belongs the keys of the treasures of the heavens and the earth. The real losers are those who do not believe in the revelations of God.
Say to the disbelievers: “You ignorant people, are you asking me to worship other than God?”
My main message revealed to you (Mohammad) and the prophets before you has been: “If you worship others than God, all your deeds will go in vain and you will become a real looser.”
Therefore worship God alone and count your blessings.
They have never honored God the way that He should be honored. God is so Great that on the Day of resurrection the earth will be in His grasp. In fact all universes [with their billions of galaxies] are [as a figure of speech] folded in his right hand. Glorified be God; it is beyond God’s dignity to have a partner.
When the trumpet is blown, every living species in the earth and heavens will fall down dead (except a few that God will let them stay alive.) When the second trumpet is blown, all will resurrect looking around.
Then the earth will shine with the light of its Lord and the records of people’s deeds will be laid open. Then the Prophets and witnesses will be summoned to testify. Everyone on that Day will be judged with absolute justice and nobody will be subject to the least injustice.
God exactly knows what people are doing and will reward them accordingly.
After being sentenced, the disbelievers will be herded to the Hell in troops. Once the doors of the Hell are opened, the Hell keepers will ask: “Did you not receive any prophet among your own people to relay the message of God and to warn you about your choice of destiny? They will reply: “Yes; but it is only after being sentenced that we realize our mistake.”
It will be said: “Now enter the gates of Hell which is your permanent abode. What a miserable place for the arrogant people to end in.”
Those who respected their Lord will be ushered toward Paradise in groups and find its door already opened for them. The guards will say: “Peace be upon you. You succeeded. Here is your permanent home.”
They will chant: “Praise the Lord Who fulfilled His promises: He made us inherit the earth and now letting us enjoy His Paradise.” What an excellent reward for the righteous ones.
Then you will see the angels circling around the Throne, glorifying and praising the Lord. Once the full justice is rendered it will be proclaimed: “Praise belongs to God; Lord of the worlds.”
H.M.
It is Almighty, the most knowledgeable who has sent down this Qur’an
God in one hand accepts repentance and forgives the sins and, on the other hand, severely punishes those who are too arrogant to ask for forgiveness and continue to oppose God’s orders. God is the only One worthy of worship; he showers the believers with favors and everyone eventually has to stand Him face to face.
None disputes the word of God except the disbelievers. Therefore, never mind them going from one place to another engaged in disinformation campaign.
[Denial of truth is not a new phenomenon.] People of Noah (as well as people of the prophets after him) denied their prophets and tried to destroy them physically and through disinformation campaign. I (God) punished them with the most severe punishment.
The words of your Lord is nothing but the truth. Those who oppose it will be sent to Hell to face the fire.
Those who serve His throne and those around the Lord glorify, worship, believe in Him and ask forgiveness for the sins of the believers saying: “O Lord you are the Most Knowledgeable in every domain; forgive those who submitted to you and follow your way and keep them away from the blazing Hell Fire.”
“We implore you, Almighty and the Most Wise, to admit them (as well as their righteous parents, wives and children) in the Gardens of Paradise that you have promised them.”
“Please do not let them fall in sins. Those whom you protected from falling in sins will be showered by your mercy in the Day of Judgment and, in fact, there is not better achievement than this.”
On the Day of Judgment, the disbelievers will be told: “You are angry at yourself now but God is more angry in account of your refusal of His inviting you to the right path.”
The disbelievers will implore: “You made us die twice and gave live twice too; we confess to our sins. Is there any way out [another chance]?”
[It will be said to them:] “Your fate is due to the fact that you refused to accept the One and Only One God as your Lord; instead you challenged Him with your gods [you asked for it and you got it]. The Judgment now rests with God, the Most High, the Most Great”
God is the One Who continuously reminds you of Himself [by exposing you to the interesting phenomena of His domain of creation] and sends down your provision from the sky above [without rain water no provision of man grows]; only those who contact God frequently appreciate His Kingdom.
Choose the religion which is sanctioned by God and worship him sincerely even though the disbelievers may not approve of you.
God is the Highest in Rank. He is Master of the throne of the Kingdom of the universe. He reveals His revelations through whoever He chooses to warn mankind of the Day that they have to meet their Lord.
On that Day everyone will be completely exposed and no one can hide nothing from the Lord. When it is asked: “To Who belongs the Kingdom of the realm of the creation?”, the whole universe will cry out: “To God, the One, the Most Powerful.”
On the Day of Judgment every soul will be judged by what it has earned. None will be subject to injustice and the justice will be imposed quickly [no lawyers’ dragging the case to the higher courts.]
Let them know that the Day is approaching very fast when the hearts will leap up to the throat and they will stay motionless at awe. Wrongdoers then will be so sorry; they will have no friend or a counselor to defend them.
God is fully aware of what the eyes cannot see and what the mind hides.
He will, therefore, judge with full Justice while the idols [in any form or shape] that the disbelievers worship cannot judge anything. God hears everything and watches over everything.
Have this disbelievers not left their towns to see what happened to the other disbelieving nations before them? They were much stronger and more productive but made God punish them for their misconducts. When God’s punishment came upon them, there was none to save them.
Their doom was due to the fact that they did not listen to their Prophets in spite of convincing miracles that they came with. Therefore God punished them. Indeed God is mighty and decisive in punishment.
I sent Moses with such miracles that left no doubt about his prophet hood to Pharaoh, [his chief advisor] Haman and Korah [the wealthiest man of the time]. …
Instead of submitting themselves, they denied [the undeniable] and called him a “sorcerer” and a “liar!”
When Moses presented his Divine message, they said: “Kill Moses along with the sons of all believers and spare their daughters for our pleasure.” The most horrible scheme of the disbelievers, however, is too weak to cover the message of God [as their plan did not even reach to the level of execution].
[At the height of desperation] Pharaoh said: “I am going to kill Moses; let me see how his God will save him. Enough is enough; he is taking you away from your religion and pretty soon he will cause a revolution.”
Moses replied: “I seek refuge in my Creator, which is your Creator too, [and, therefore, do not have the least fear] from all you arrogant people who do not believe in the Day of the Judgment.”
At this time a believing man among Pharaoh’s people (who had kept his faith hidden) spoke out and said: “How can you kill a man just for saying that there is only One God? If in spite of all his outstanding miracles you regard him as a liar, then leave him alone [you do not kill someone in account of his belief]. If, on the other hand, he is truthful, then take advantage of his guidance. Know that if you go beyond the boundaries of justice [and kill Moses], God will never guide you kind of people.
[The man then continued:] “O my people, today you possess the power and have the upper hand. Why do you challenge God to send his punishment upon us? Who is going to help us, if that happens? Pharaoh responded: “Don’t worry; I know right and wrong and I will guide you to the right path!”
The believing man said: “O my people, I am afraid that you will have the same fate as the nations before you who provoked God’s anger:…
The fate of the people of Noah, Ad, Thamud and the other wrong doing nations and this in spite of the fact that God does not have any enmity with His creatures.”
“O’ my people, I hate to see you [how shameful and sorry you are] on the Day that you will be summoned to meet your Lord.”
“To see you running around, cry out to each other and find none [in your desperation] to protect you from God’s punishment. What a shame that there is none to guide the one who has made God disappointed from him up to a pint that He has let him to slip deeper and deeper into the darkness.
“Remember that, before Moses, God sent Joseph [to Egypt] with clear proofs of his prophet hood but you still doubted; and when he died you [my people] said: “God will never send another Prophet after him” [so that you close the doors of any opportunity to be challenged]. God indeed let the doubters slip into the darkness.”
“These doubters and sinners are the ones who dispute the words of God with crooked arguments. This is a characteristic that is most resented by God and makes Him to put a seal on the heart of such arrogant people.”
Pharaoh then [interrupted the man arrogantly and] said to Haman [his Prime Minister]: “Build for me a tall tower so that I may reach the heaven and look at this god of Moses…
I want to be sure that he is a liar.” Thus the idiotic attitude of Pharaoh seemed to him the most appropriate and I (God) let him slip, in return, into darkness. Thus Pharaoh’s evil plans fired back and led to his own ruin.
The man who had believed continued saying: “O my people, follow me and let me show you the right path.”
“Know that the life in this world is temporary and will pass fast by; it is the life in our real home in Hereafter which is permanent.”
“Any one who does a wrong thing will receive equal suffering for it. As to the good deeds of men and women, they will receive limitless rewards in the Paradise, if they choose to believe.”
“O’ my people, what is wrong with you? I am inviting you to salvation and you are inviting me to the Fire!”
“You are asking me to worship the unknown deities while I invite you to the Almighty, the Most Forgiving.”
“The fact of the matter is: those, who you invite me to worship, have no power neither in this world nor in the Hereafter. Our final return is to God and the wrongdoers have only one destiny: the fire.”
“[I know that I am going to loose my privileges in account of my speech but] Soon you will remember my words. I [am no afraid a bit as I] put my trust in God who is watching over His servants.”
[Although the fate of the believing man was supposed to be terrible,] God saved him while the disbelievers of Pharaoh’s people received an awful punishment.
[While waiting for their Resurrection (in the grave),] The people of Pharaoh will continuously be exposed to the nightmare of their destiny, i.e., the Hell. On the Day of Resurrection, it will be ordered: “Now admit them to the worse place of Hell for the most horrible punishment.”
While in the Fire, the lower rank ones will say to their superiors: “We followed your orders blindly; now can you use your “power” to at least reduce our punishment?”
The “powerful” ones will say: “We are all in the same boat; God has already passed His [unchangeable] judgment.”
[Disappointed from their “superiors’” inability,] They will turn then into the Hell Keepers saying: “We beg you to pray so that God may give us only one day break from the Fire.”
The Hell Keepers will reply: “Did not your Prophets explain with undeniable proofs your choices?” They will say: “Yes.” The Hell Keepers then will reply with no compassion: “Pray yourself then.” There will be no response for the disbelievers’ prayers.
Be assured that I (God) will give the final victory to My Prophets and those who believed in this world as well as the Day that the witnesses will be summoned.
On the Day of Judgment the apologies of the wrongdoers will not be accepted as they have already earned the curse of God and have earned the worst place to live in.
I gave Moses the guidance and blessed the Jews with the Scriptures.
The scriptures were the beacon to light up their way and a source of reference for the seekers of wisdom.
[You (Mohammad) will be helped in the same manner too; therefore] Be patient as God delivers what He promises. Glorify your Lord in the morning and in the evening and ask forgiveness for your sins.
Those argumentative people who challenge the word of God without any knowledge are sick of arrogance (without even knowing it) and will fail. Seek refuge in God as He hears everything and sees everything.
Most people do not realize the awesome effort that God has put in the creation of the universe. It has been much more awesome than the creation of mankind [therefore, God can resurrect man easily anytime He wishes.]
For the same token that a blind person and the one blessed with the faculty of seeing are not equal, the wrongdoers and the righteous ones are not equal either [ justice, therefore, requires the existence of the Hereafter so that people be rewarded accordingly.] Most people, however, care less.
The resurrection will surely take place but most people doubt it.
Your Lord says: “Call upon Me: I will answer your prayers. Those who resent worshipping Me in account of their arrogance will be humiliated and thrown into the Hell.”
God has created the night so that you rest and the day bright [so that you find your provision]. The fact is that God is the most generous to the people yet most people are not grateful.
Such is God your Lord; the Creator of everything. There is only One God. How dare you to choose the wrong path?
Only those who do not respect God’s revelations will be mislead.
God is the One Who made the earth hospitable for you and put a canopy around it [the ozone layer], gave you the highest faculties [compared to the animals] and provided you the purest provisions [for a healthy life]. Such is God your Lord, Highest in rank and King of the universe.
God is alive. There is no god beside Him. Call upon Him and no one else for help and guidance. Choose a God pleasing way of life. Praise be to God, the Lord of the universe.
O’ Mohammad, tell the people: “I have been forbidden to worship anything but God. How can I do else after being exposed to His clear proofs? I [like everyone else] am commanded to submit to the Lord of all creation.”
God is the one who created you originally from the earthly materials. He made the sperm change into a clot of blood and eventually turned it into a child. God then makes you to grow up to attain the full strength. He then lets you attain the old age and some are summoned before completing the whole cycle. Your whole life is a gift from God so that you discover and understand the reality.
God is the One Who Gives life and ordains death. Whatever He desires to be done, He simply says: “Be” and it shall be.
Have you noted why the argumentative disbelievers are in the wrong path?
That is because they disbelieved in the Scriptures and looked down upon My messages sent to them through My Prophets. Pretty soon they will find out the consequences of their denial:
Shackles around their necks and chains to drag them toward the Hell.
First thrown inside the boiling water and then the Fire.
They will be asked: “Where are what you were worshipping beside God?” They will say: “They have abandoned us…..
Now we realize that we were worshipping nothing of real value” [after all, what is the “real value” of a piece of paper that people devote all their life to accumulate?] They
deserve to be left alone by God to follow the wrong path.
It will be said to them: “Your fate is due to your following and promoting wrong doctrines. In consequence, enter through the gates of the Hell and stay there forever; what a miserable destiny has led your arrogance to.”
God tells you the truth, so be patient Mohammad. whether I let you see the partial consequence of their disbelief or ordain the death upon you before that, they will be summoned to My court on the Day of Judgment.
I sent many Prophets before you. The life story of some of them are mentioned to you and the others you do not know about them. No Prophet may produce a miracle without God’s authorization. When God passes His Judgment, the falsehood will disappear and the truth will prevail.
God is the One Who has created the cattle for you; some you ride on and some you use as food.
You also get additional benefits from them. You use them, as well as the ships [and other man made vehicles], to go wherever you desire.
These are the simple proofs of the existence of God. How do you deny His signs scattered around you? [Could you ride on something without God’s power fueling it?]
Have they not ever traveled to see the ruins of the other civilizations? The latter were more populated, mightier and left more traces behind. Yet all their materialistic achievements did not protect them [after all what kind of materialistic wealth one can take with him while leaving this world?]
When I sent them My Prophets with clear signs and proofs, they stuck to their own style of life and social systems. The very things that they ridiculed, were the cause of their fall.
When they faced My punishment, they cried out: “We now believe in God, the one. We denounce all those gods whom we used to worship beside God.”
But the belief or the repentance after the inevitable [death or punishment of God] is not acceptable. The fact of the matter is: “The disbelievers are always doomed.”
H.M.
The verses of Qur’an are exact words of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Forgiving.
A book which its verses are explained in detail, worthy of being read, in [your own] Arabic language for those people who are blessed with the faculty of understanding.
Qur’an informs you of the good news [for the believers] and also warns [the wrongdoers]; what a pity that most people care less.
The disbelievers say: “Qur’an has no way open to reach our hearts. It has divided us; you go your way and we will follow ours.”
Say: “I am only a human being like you but blessed with God’s revelations indicating that there is only One God. Worship only God and return to his path and ask forgiveness for your wrongdoings. What a terrible end awaits those who worship the idols [in any form or shape.]
The latter are those who do not pay their charity dues and deny the Hereafter.
As for those who have believed and have done good deed, an everlasting reward is waiting for them.
Tell them: “How dare you to deny the [powerful] One Who’s sign of power is that He] created the earth in two periods? Instead you believe in [powerless] idols! Only God is the Lord of the universe.”
God is the One Who [after having created the earth] established the mountains and made it hospitable and established an eco-system to provide the needs of the living species in four periods.
When God created the earth and the universe, which at the beginning was nothing but gases, He said: “Come into existence willingly or unwillingly”. They replied: “We do come to existence in submission to your [physical] laws.”
God, in two periods, created the seven universes and in each heaven He established its [physical] laws. God has adorned the lower heaven [where we live in] with beacons and made it secure. Such is the [impeccable] design of the Almighty, the most Knowledgeable.
If the disbelievers [after being reminded of God’s greatness] still persist, then say: “I am warning of a disaster like the thunderbolt which descended upon the nations of Ad and Thamud.”
Their Prophets tried in every way to make them understand that: “You should worship none but God”; they (jokingly) said: “If God really wanted [to convey a message], He would have sent us angles; [as you are people like us,] we do not believe in what you say.
People of Ad became increasingly arrogant for no reason. They were challenging any one to be stronger than them. Did they not realize that God, who created them at first place, is much more powerful than they? Yet they refused to submit to their Lord.
Consequently they deserved to be humiliated by the strong windstorm that I sent upon them as punishment for several miserable days. Their punishment in Hereafter is much worth and they can never escape it.
As for the Thamud, I offered them the right path but they chose to stay blind rather than opening their eyes to my light of guidance. Consequently I humiliated them by sending a disastrous thunderbolt which they really deserved it.
Only [a few] righteous ones among them were spared.
Just imaging the Day that the enemies of God will be gathered together to face the Hell.
Their own ears, eyes and skins will testify against what they have been doing in this world [after all who can deny the video of his own actions?]
They will ask their skins: “Why did you witness against us?” They will reply: “God made us to speak up. God is the One Who makes everything to speak. God is the One Who created you at first place and now is time that you face Him.”
Where in the universe will you hide from your own eyes, ears and skins that you never thought will witness against you? You were under impression that God is not aware of all your deeds!
This kind of attitude has ruined you and eventually turns you into a looser [even though you may look successful by worldly standards.]
If the disbelievers insist upon their attitude and way of life, they will end up in Hell no matter what excuse they come up with.
[In account of their attitudes,] God has surrounded them with the kind of companies which make their deeds fair seeming to them. Thus, they will end up where the ungrateful men and extraterrestrials (Jins) before them ended up . Indeed they were the losers.
The disbelievers say: “Do not listen to Qur’an and whenever it is being recited, make noise so that you overcome the Muslims.”
I (God) will certainly punish them and they will pay for their wrong deeds.
Hell is the punishment for the enemies of God in which they will live forever as a punishment for discarding my words.
[Once found themselves in the Hell,] the disbelievers will say: “Our Lord, give us those men and extra-terrestrials (Jins) who led us to the wrong way so that we may beat them down with our feet and reduce them to dust.”
Those who used to say: “God is our Lord” and led a righteous life, will be welcomed by the Angles, saying: “have no fear or worry, you will enjoy the Paradise which was promised to you.”
“We were your companions in your worldly life and will company you Hereafter…
You will have whatever you desire in the Paradise and whatever you wish will be at your disposition; your reward from the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”
What word better than: “I have submitted myself to God” may be pronounced by the one who does the goods deeds and invites people to join a style of life sanctioned by the Lord?
(Mohammad), know that goodness and evil are not equal. Therefore resort to the nicest response [to the worse treatment]. It is only then that your worse enemy may turn to be your best friend one day.
None can attain such a greatness except those who practice patience; how fortunate they are.
When you feel that Satan is inciting you to leave the way to the greatness, say: “I seek refuge in God.” Know that God is Hearer and the Most Knowledgeable.
Among the signs/ proofs of [the existence and the greatness] God are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate before the sun nor the moon [pretending that you are worshipping God through them!]; prostrate before the One Who has created them, if you are sincere in worshipping God.
It does not matter if the disbelievers persist in their arrogance and not worship the Lord. [God does not really need their worship as the] Angles who are nearest to God glorify Him day and night without being tired of.
Another sign of [the greatness of] God is the water that He orders to be sent down to give life to a dead land. The same God Who brings the dead land to life can bring the dead person also to life. Indeed God has power over everything.
Those who misrepresent God’s signs are not out of His reach. Just consider who is better off: he who will be thrown into the Hellfire or he who meets his Lord securely in the Day of Judgment? The choice is yours, but know that God is watching over everything you do.
The who reject their Lord’s message when it is presented to them are guilty as they reject an honorable Book (Qur’an).
No falsehood can enter into the God’s [original] Book [which is revealed to all prophets] throughout the time; it is a revelation of the Most Wise and the Most Praiseworthy.
Nothing is being said to you (Mohammad) which has not already been said to the Prophets before you [Qur’an is thus being the same book which was revealed to all Prophets but lost throughout the time]. Surely your Lord is forgiving [as he gives ample time to disbelievers to contemplate] as well as harsh in punishment.
If Qur’an was revealed in another language, the argumentative people would have said: “Why is it revealed in such and such language?” Arabic or non-Arabic, let them know that: “It is a guide and healing for those who believe. As to the disbelievers, they have a plug in their ears to hear it and a cover over their eyes to see it. It sounds to them a call to far away from them to listen.”
Before you, I gave the Book to Moses which was equally disputed. If God had not pre-determined it [the Day of Judgment], they would have been judged immediately. That is why they carry so many doubts.
If you do a good deed, God will reward you and if you do an evil deed, you will bear its consequences. God is not so unjust as to let go to waste the good deeds and not punish the evil doers.
Only God knows when the Resurrection will take place. God has such a perfect knowledge of His dominion that He knows What fruit will come out of such and such seed, which female is pregnant and who has given birth. On the Day of Judgment, God will ask the disbelievers: “Where are those whom you choose as your lords besides me?” They will say: “Now we submit ourselves to you and bear witness that there is no lord but God.”
[they will look around desperately to see if ] their idols [in any form and shape that they used to worship] will come to their rescue and none will come to help them.
Man [in general, does not submit himself to the will of God and always] prays for good things. When an unfortunate thing happens, he loses hope.
When God, out of mercy, changes the man’s unfortunate situation, he says: “I deserve it”; then he [becomes rebellious and] denies the Resurrection. Then he says: “If by any chance I am brought back to my Lord, I have been good enough to be rewarded.” The fact of the matter is I (God) will inform the disbelievers of all their deeds and punish them severely.
When I bless man, he turns away and forgets about his Lord; but when in trouble, he comes to Me with lengthy prayers.
Say to disbelievers: “What if this Qur’an [that you blindly reject] is truly from God; then who will be more unjust to himself than the one who [without any consideration] denies his Lord’s Commandments?”
Pretty soon I will show the consequences of their refusal inside them [their chronicle problems of alcoholism, gambling, infidelity, etc. etc. etc.] as well as their surroundings [a corrupt society which refuses to accept God’s medication for its social problems] so that they realize this Qur’an is indeed the truth. Do they not realize the importance of the fact that God is watching them?
These people are in doubt about the meeting with their Lord. God is fully aware of everything.
H.M.
A.S.Q.
Hereby the Almighty and the Most Wise reveals His revelations to you (Mohammad) the same way that He revealed His revelations to the prophets before you.
To God belongs everything in the heavens and the earth; He is the Most High (in rank) and the Greatest.
The entire universe would like to explode [out of rage when man assigns a son to God or deifies a creature of God] and the angles, praising and glorifying their Lord, ask for forgiveness for those [ignorant] on earth. God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
Those who choose other than God as their Lord, God holds them responsible for their wrongdoings and you (Mohammad) are not responsible for their behavior.
Thus I (God) have revealed to you this Qur’an in Arabic language so that you may warn the people of your hometown and surroundings about the inevitable Day of resurrection. [On that Day] some will go to Paradise and the rest will go to Hell.
Had God willed, He would have made everybody the member of one community [Muslim]. Instead, God [has given man the freedom of choice to chose between good and bad and] will admits whoever He wills [and deserves] into His mercy and the wrongdoers [who will naturally not be admitted into His mercy] have neither any protector nor a helper.
[What a foolish thing that the disbelievers] have chosen other guardians besides God. Man’s Guardian is God alone [for the simple reason that]: He is the only One Who gives life to the dead and He has power over everything.
God is the final judge in whatever you differ in. The same Judge is my Lord. I have put my trust in God and only to Him I return [for guidance.] 
God is the Initiator of the heavens and the earth. He is the One Who has created for man, and other living species, spouses of the same kind so that you populate [the earth.] There is nothing similar to God; He sees everything and hears everything
God alone owns the key to the treasure of the heavens and earth. [In his absolute wisdom,] He gives to some more and to some less. God is the Most Knowledgeable.
God has prescribed for you the same way of life that He prescribed to Noah. God has revealed to you (Mohammad) the same principles revealed to Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Do not make any division [in the religion of God.] It is difficult for the disbelievers to submit themselves to the God pleasing way of life. God chooses for Himself whoever He decides and guides to His way those who turn to Him.
[Ironically, the followers of the scriptures] broke up into sects after the knowledge was revealed to them, in account of jealousy between themselves! If God had not made a pre-determined decision to take care of them on the Day of Judgment, He would have settled the matter immediately. The fact of the matter is that the followers of the Scriptures have inherited nothing but a bunch of doubts.
Therefore, invite them to the same [straight] way and accomplish your mission as you (Mohammad) are commanded and do not compromise and do not follow their whims and say: “I believe in the [the original] Scriptures that God has sent down. I have been commanded to establish justice between you [by reference to a Divine code of justice revealed in Qur’an.] God is our Lord as well as yours. We are all personally responsible for our deeds. There is no dispute between us [as God has made everything clear in Qur’an.] Know well that God one day will gather us together in His court and we will all eventually return to Him.”
Now that the message of God is clearly presented, those who dispute it are inviting God’s anger and will be severely punished.
Know that it is God Who has sent down this Book to be used as a balance [as it is the symbol of any legal system]; as you do not know how close the Hour of Judgment is.
Those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment are [jokingly] looking forward to meet it and those who believe in it are deeply concerned about it. Those who challenge the happening of the Day of Resurrection are deeply in disbelief.
God is Aware and Kind to His servants. He gives whatever He pleases to whom He decides. He is the Most Powerful, the Almighty.
The one who wants to receive the reward of his deeds in Hereafter, I (God) will give it to him in a multiplied way then. The one who wants to receive the reward of his deeds in this world, I will give it to him here on one to one basis; however, in the Hereafter, he will receive no share whatsoever.
How dare some to adopt a way of life [such as Western way of life these days] laid by those whom they are fascinated with and not sanctioned by God. If I (God) had not predetermined to reserve my judgment for the Day of Judgment, I would have dealt with them immediately. For such wrongdoers, for sure there is a painful punishment in reserve.
You will witness a Day when these wicked people will fearfully analyze their deeds and will certainly pay for it. As for those who believed and did good deeds, they will end up in the Gardens of Paradise. they will receive from their Lord whatever they desire. This is the greatest achievement.
This is God’s good news to His faithful and righteous servants. Mohammad, say: “I do not ask any reward from you [for my “consulting” services of guiding you to the Paradise]. The only thing that I am asking is your love [which does not cost you anything] toward those who are close to me.” Those who do a good deed, I (God) will reward him many folded as I am Forgiving and Appreciative.
How dare they to accuse you (Mohammad) of lying [fabricating this Qur’an]? If God wanted, He could have made you resent them [so that you forget about them and do not continue your mission which is guiding them to the right path]; but God has decided to erase the falsehood and present the truth with His own words. God is fully aware of anyone’s most intimate thoughts.
The Forgiver is the One Who accepts His servants’ repentance and covers their sins. God is aware of whatever you do.
God accepts the prayers of the believers who do good deeds and showers them with His blessings. As for the disbelievers, an awful destiny is in reserve for them.
If God gives His servants too much, their wealth would turn them rebellious. That is why He [does them a favor and] gives them as much as it is the best for them as God knows His servants and sees what they do.
God is the One Who spreads His mercy and sends down the rain in a time when people loose their hope. He is the only master, the Most Praiseworthy.
Among the signs of the Lord’s power is the creation of the heavens and the earth as well as the living species which he has scattered in the heavens and the earth [informing of the existence of life outside our planet]. God can gather them all together whenever He decides.
Any misfortune that happens to you (the disbelievers) is the consequence of your deeds; and this in spite of the fact that God overlooks most of your wrongdoings.
You can not overpower and escape God and you do not have any helper nor any protector but God.
Among the signs of the Lord’s power is the huge ships [which He has created by the hand of His creature, i.e., man and are] as tall as mountains in the sea [which do not sink by the will of God in spite of their weights].
If God wills, He may order the winds to stop and let your ship stay still. These are proofs [that God is mentioning] for those who remain patient and are grateful to their Lord.
God can easily destroy the wrongdoers in account of their deeds; instead He overlooks many of their sins [giving them every opportunity to return to the right path].
Those argumentative disbelievers who challenge God’s signs and proofs have no rational basis for their arguments.
Anything at your disposition is merely loaned to you by God so that you pass through this transitory life. Whatever God grants in Hereafter is far better and everlasting for the believers who put their trust in their Lord, .
They are those who avoid great sins and indecencies and when [for some reason] become angry they ask God to forgive them [for letting anger to take control over them].
They are those who respect the law of their Lord, worship Him, manage their affairs by mutual consultation [the basis for a parliamentary system in any Islamic community] and give a part of their income (which is given to them by God at first place) to charity.
They are those who stand up for their rights when facing a gross injustice [and retaliate].
[Principle #1:] An evil act should be retaliated by an equal act [eye for an eye]; however, [principle #2:] God rewards those who pardon and lead a righteous life. [Principle #3:] God does not love the wrongdoers [who retaliate excessively].
Certainly, those who defend themselves in face of injustice have not done anything wrong.
The wrongdoers are those who oppress others and establish themselves by force in the land; for them there is a painful punishment in reserve.
In any case, bear in mind that patience and forgiveness reflect strength of character.
Those who [deserve that] God let them slide more and more into darkness will never find any protector. You will see them on the Day of Judgment begging for a second chance when they see with their own eyes how awful of a punishment is waiting for them.
You will see how humiliated they are when they encounter the hell. They look at Hell while trying to avoid looking at it. The believers then will have the last word saying: “The real failure is to loose one’s soul and folks on the Day of Judgment. Indeed the losers will suffer an everlasting torture.”
The wrongdoers will have no protector to save them from God’s punishment. Those who [deserve that] God let them slide toward darkness will never be guided to the right path again.
Answer to your Lord’s call before the inevitable Day of Judgment. Remember, there will be no refuge for you on that Day nor a defense.
Now [after all being told,] if the disbelievers turn away, remember that I have not sent you (Mohammad) as their guardian. Your only mission is to deliver the message. Man [in general] behaves in a proud manner when I (God) shower him with my mercy. When, on the contrary, in account of his deeds, a misfortune happens to him, he turns into disbelief!
God [and no power but God] is in absolute control in the heavens and on the earth. He creates whatever He wills. He may decide to give a son to someone and a daughter to someone else.
God may wed men and women and then either grant them children or make them barren.. God knows everything and has power over everything.
It is beneath the dignity of God, the Most High and the Most Wise to directly communicate with man. His form of communications are through inspiration [which is the source of so many inventions], talking behind a veil [Moses is the only one known in this respect] or through revelation to his prophets.
Thus, I (God) have revealed my commandments to you [through Angle Gabriel] while you had no idea about the Book nor the faith. I sent this light (Qur’an) to guide whoever I choose [and deserves to be chosen]. Indeed you (Mohammad) are guiding man to the right path:
The path of God, to whom belongs everything in the heavens and on the earth. Know that the final decision belongs to God.
H.M.
(God) swear by this book which explains its subject matter so clearly.
This Qur’an is revealed in Arabic to you [who were expecting it in another language as a sign of miracle] so that you read it in your own maternal language and understand it.
This book, which is preserved in the heaven by God almighty Himself, is the source of all the scriptures and God revealed literatures; it is the most honorable book and full of wisdom.
You, the sinners, definitely do not deserve to receive this book. It is only in account of God’s mercy that this message is sent to you.
Before Mohammad, God sent many prophets to their own people. …
They were all mocked at.
Beware; I (God) severely punished those people and they were much stronger than you to set an example.
If you asked them [the Arabs], “Who has created the heavens and the earth?”, they will reply, “The Almighty, the One Who knows everything.”
God is the One Who made this planet hospitable for you with paths in it to lead you to your destination.
God is the One Who sends down water from the sky in right amount to bring life to dead lands. For the same token that the dead land is resurrected [in front of your eyes], you too will be resurrected.
God is the One Who created every living species in pairs. He has created ships [by giving creative ability to you] and has made some animals subservient to you so that you may roam the earth.
As you use your vehicles, you should express your gratitude by saying: “Glory to the Lord Who subjected them to us; otherwise, we could not have controlled them ourselves.”
[then continue saying:] “Indeed one Day we will be returned to meet our Lord.”
[In spit of knowing and recognizing all these favors,] they dare to raise God’s own creation [hand made idols, the prophets, angles, etc.] to heaven and deify it. Indeed man is the most unappreciative.
[They say] God has chosen females (whom He has created at first place) as His daughters while bless them with sons [as they consider having a female child is a matter of sham!]
When any of them is given the news of being blessed by a daughter, his face turns black in grief!
How dare they to assign a baby girl, wrapped up in ornaments and unable even to talk, as God’s daughter?
The disbelievers say that the Angles (who are created by and are the servants of the Most Gracious) are female! Have their witnessed their creation [for committing such a blasphemy]? Know that their saying is recorded and will be used against them.
The disbelievers say: “If the Most Merciful (God) had not willed, we would have never been able to worship them (the angles)! These are baseless arguments. They do not know what they are talking about [otherwise every crime can be justified according to this argument.]
If they have a book of mine [source of reference] to justify their acts, let them bring it up [This indicates that morality of each society depends on its book of laws and what book of laws superior than the one of God].
Their only argument is, “We follow the footsteps of our forefathers [even if they are wrong.]”
In the past too, whenever I (God) sent a Warner to a nation their leaders [whose income depended upon the existing unjust order] would say: “We follow the footsteps of our forefathers.”
Every Prophet would ask, “What if I guide you to a better path than the footsteps of your forefathers?” They would simply reply: “We do not care about your way!”
In consequence, I took vengeance on them. See what the destiny of the rejecters of the Truth was.
As to Abraham, he said to his father and his people: “I do not have anything to do with what you worship.”
“I worship only the One Who created me as He is the One Who can guide me.”
Abraham left a slogan [only God is worthy of worship] behind so that the generations to come may find guidance by following it.
Although these people [in Arabian Peninsula] turned away from Abraham’s path, and followed their forefathers, I (God) sustained them until I sent them the Truth through a clarifying messenger (Mohammad).
But when the Truth was revealed to them they said: “This is sorcery and we reject it.”
Their objection was: “Why this Qur’an is not revealed to a “great” man of our two main cities?”
Since when do they decide whom shall God assign as His Prophet? Do they not know that it is God Who has distributed among them whatever they own, giving some superiority in rank so that they themselves help each other? Know that your Lord’s mercy (prophet hood) worth much more than the wealth of your leaders [which have made them so “great” in your eyes.]
Had there been no danger of all human beings inclined toward unbelief, I (God) would have given every disbeliever a house with roofs of silver and gold and stairways by which they go to upper levels.
Their mansions would have had golden doors and luxurious furnishings.
I would have also given them adornments of precious metals and stones. But all these [that man considers as the supreme achievement in life] are temporary materials of this lowly world life. Whatever is in reserve for the righteous ones, Hereafter, is much better [than the ultimate achievement in materialistic life.]
*Whoever disregards the message of God, I (God) will assign a Satan to be his companion.
These satanic companions will take them further away from the Lord’s Guidance while giving them the impression that only they are right.
When such a person would find himself in My (God’s) presence, he would say to his companion: “I wish you were half the world far away from me. What an evil companion you were to me.”
It will not be a consolation to you on that day to see that your satanic companion is being sent to Hell as you too will end up there.
Can you make the deaf to listen to the guidance? Ca you show the way to the blind or those who are totally lost? [so do not waste your time on them.]
Whether you (Mohammad) live long enough to see it or not [as the disbelievers were planning to kill Mohammad], I (God) will surely punish them.
I may let you see [if I decide to let you live,] the infliction of the punishment that I have promised for them. Indeed I have full control over the disbelievers.
Therefore, stick with the book (Qur’an) and go on doing your mission; [for you this pleasure is enough that] You are on the right path.
The fact of the matter is that you (Mohammad) and your nation are chosen to be honored with the revelation of this book. Know that you will be judged by this book (Qur’an).
Refer to the previous Prophet’s teachings: Did anyone of them teach that an entity apart from the Lord should be worshipped?
[As an example of the previous Prophet’s teaching] I (God) went Moses with great miracles [as a proof of his Prophet hood] to Pharaoh and his chiefs saying: “I am a Prophet from the One Who has created the worlds.”
When Moses introduced God’s miracles, they simply laughed.
The miracles were more and more majestic in nature till I sent them the plagues so that they may [come into their senses and] seek refuge in God.
They said: “Mr. “magician” ask “your” God , as you have an understanding with him, to remove this plague; we will then follow the right way.”
However, when I removed the plagues, they denied their promises [of following the right path.]
One day Pharaoh proclaimed: “Do not you see that the kingdom of Egypt with all its rivers belong to me?”
“See for yourself who is better; I or this lowly (Moses) one who can not even speak fluently!”
“How come he does not own the golden bracelet of nobility or an army of angles as his bodyguards?”
Pharaoh degraded his people and they accepted it as they were not noble people.
When they persisted in wrongdoing, I punished them by drowning them all.
May this be a precedent [for those who never learn from the history] and a lesson [for those who are intelligent enough to learn a lesson.]
[As another example of the previous prophet’s teachings,] When the case of Jesus was mentioned, the disbelievers made a mockery saying:
“Who is better to worship, our gods or Jesus?” They said this in the spirit of dispute [and not a sincere discussion.] They are indeed nothing but a bunch of argumentative people.
Jesus was no more than a servant of God whom I favored and sent as a prophet to the Jews.
If it pleases to me, I can turn some of you into Angles [in nature] and let you reproduce and take over the earth.
His birth [most probably the second coming (birth) of Christ] is the sign for upcoming Day of resurrection. Therefore do not have any doubt about it [Jesus or Resurrection] and follow Me (God) as this is the straight path.
Do not let the Satan talk you into denying it [the resurrection]; Satan is your true enemy.
[Another example of the previous Prophets teachings is Jesus] When Jesus came with undeniable miracles, he said: “I have brought wisdom to you. I have come to make clear what you are differing in; respect God’s law and follow me.”
“The fact is that God is my Teacher and your Teacher; Worship Him alone [see Mathew 4-10]; this is the Straight Way.”
But in spite of his clear teachings [about worshipping none but God], his followers disagreed among themselves. What a punishment awaits for those who initiated these disagreements on the Day of Judgment.
What are the disbelievers waiting for [what are they wasting their time on]? Are they waiting [wasting their lives in vain] for the Day [of resurrection] which will overtake them unexpectedly?
On that Day the friends will turn into enemies, save the righteous ones.
The believers will be assured: “My servants, do not have any fear and grief today.”
“You believed in My revelations and submitted yourselves to my laws.”
“You and your [believing] spouses enter to paradise and find happiness there.”
“You will be served drinks in golden cups passing around in golden trays. You will find everything your heart desires and your eyes pleases. You will live therein forever.”
“Such is the Paradise that you inherit as a reward for your good deeds.”
“There, you will find any kind of fruit that you may eat.” 
As for the disbelievers, they will be tortured in the Hell forever.
Their punishment will never be reduced and they will live there in despair.
I (God) was not unjust to them, they themselves were unjust.
They will beg: “O Keeper of the Hell, ask God to finish us off.” He will reply: “No, you are condemned to suffer forever.”
We offered you the truth but most of you resented the truth.
They came with a plan [against Mohammad], I (God), too came with My plan.
Do they think that I do not hear their secret talks and their whisperings? I hear everything and my angels at their sides record everything.
Say: “If the Most Gracious had a son, I [am not stubborn and] would be the first to worship him.”
Glorified is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The Lord of the Dominion is far superior than what they attribute to.
Let them be amused by their fabrications till they see the Day which is waiting them.
He is the Lord in the Heavens. He is the Lord on the earth. He is the Most Wise, the Most knowledgeable.
Highly blessed is He to whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything between them. He is the only One Who knows when the Resurrection will take place; and to Him you will all return.
None of those whom they idolize will ask God for mercy; on the contrary, they will testify for the truth [against them.]
When you ask they who created them, they will say God. What is their problem then?
God hears His Prophet’s voice when he says: “By Lord, these people will never submit.”
[Do not confront them then.] Whenever you encounter them just wish them peace; soon they will surely find out.
H.M.
I (God) swear by this book which clearly answers man’s most difficult questions [about the purpose of life and Hereafter.]
Qur’an is revealed in a blessed night as God decided to shower man with His blessing.
Qur’an answers to those philosophical questions that no one is capable of answering.
This book is revealed with God’s command. God (out of His Mercy) sends prophets to people to relay His divine message.
This revelation is a proof of God’s Mercy; God is indeed the Most Knowledgeable and hears everything.
Have faith that God is the creator of the heavens and earth and anything in the universe.
There is no other god but God. He is the one who gives life and takes it away. He is your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors.
What a shame that you doubt in the existence of God.
Your doubt will certainly be removed, when you see the mass of smoke descending from the heaven.
When this painful punishment overtakes man, he will pray saying:….
“Our Lord, remove this disaster as we really believe in you!”
It will be too late to believe then; God’s Prophet did already warned them.
[When there was still the opportunity], they turned away from the Prophet saying: “He is well educated but unfortunately gone crazy!”
[The fact of the matter is] Anytime, I postpone the punishment, the disbelievers start rebelling again.
The Day that I (God) send the severest quake, will be the Day when I will take the vengeance.
In the past, I (God) put the people of Pharaoh to the same test by sending my honorable Prophet (Moses).
He (Moses) said: “Listen to me (you the creatures of God); I am an honest messenger of the Lord.”
“[Listen to me and obey your Lord.] Do not rebel against God. I will come up with powerful miracles [to convince you.]
If you assault me, I will take refuge in the same God that has Created you and me.
If you do not believe me, [for your own sake] do not even think about harming me.
Finally Moses gave up and said: “[My Lord] These people are indeed criminals.”
God answered Moses saying] “Take my servants [Israelites and non- Israelites believers] out tonight. You will be followed [by Pharaoh].”
“Cross the sea quickly and let their army drawn.”
What a shame that] they left behind many gardens and springs.
Crops and their easy life.
And God’s blessing that they were enjoying.
All the above God made to be inherited by other people.
None cared about their death and they were not given any more opportunity.
That is the way that I (God) saved the descendents of Israel from a humiliating persecution from…
the Pharaoh who was indeed the most prominent tyrant.
Then I (God) gave them superiority over other nations, knowing their defaults.
I showed them so many proofs to test their believe [immediately after having seen the greatest proof, i.e., passage through the Red Sea, they worshiped a cow instead of God.]
The disbelievers say:…
“There is nothing after death and we will not be raised back to life.”
[They say:] “Bring our forefathers back to life, if [there is such thing as life after death and if] you are truthful.” [Even then they will not believe as the Jews did not believe in vs. 33].
Do these disbelievers think that they are better than the [mighty] people of Tubba [strong rulers of Hyyarites B.C.-A.D.] and the ones before them? I (God) destroyed them as they were guilty.
I have not created the heavens and the earth (and whatever between) for fun.
There is a higher purpose behind the creation but most people do not understand it.
Know that on the Day of Resurrection, everyone will be gathered together.
On that Day no one may benefit from any supporter and nobody will be of any help.
The only available recourse will be the mercy of God. God is Almighty, the Most Merciful.
The Hellish fruit of …
the Zaqqum tree will be the food of the sinners…
this will burn the stomach the same way…
that boiling water burns the stomach.
“Catch the sinner and bring him to the…
middle of Hell and pour over his head the boiling water. …
See what an honorable man [as you were proud of] you are…
This is what you were mocking at.”
The God loving people will end up in the securest [no disease, no aging, no worry] place:
Roaming in the gardens with the springs.
Dressed in fine silk cloths.
Married to most beautiful women.
In absolute peace. Every kind of tasty things at their disposition.
They will never be touched by death and God, by His grace will protect them from the Hell.
This is the real success.
I have made this book easy to understand in Arabic. May you take advantage of it.
Wait [to get your share], as the disbelievers are waiting [to get their share] too.
H.M.
This book has been sent down by God the Almighty, the Most Wise.
The heavens and the earth is fool of proofs for those who believe in God.
Those who are sure that there is a God, can see the power of the One and Only One God in their own creation, as well as the creation of other living species that God has scattered all over.
Those who understand, can see the sings for the existence of God in the appearance of the day after night, the rain that God sends from the sky to bring life into a dead land and the blow of the wind.
These verses are the words of God being sent to you. What source better than God Himself exists that people should refer to find an answer to their questions?
Shame to sinful people who hide the truth and recourse to lies.
These sinful people listen to the word of God recited to them, then turn they back and proudly denounce it. Let them know that a terrible punishment is waiting for them.
Those people who listen to God’s word and then make a mockery will be severely punished.
The Hell is waiting for such people. The idols that they worship, as well as whatever they have got, can not save them from an awful punishment which is waiting for them.
Qur’an is a guidance. Those who disregard the verses of Qur’an will insure God’s most terrible punishment.
God is the One Who submitted the seas to your service so that you may sail your ships by His Grace and ask God to help you to obtain your needed materials [food, oil, minerals, jewelry, etc.] from it. May you be grateful to your Lord.
God has also submitted whatever is in the heavens and earth for you [exploring other planets, therefore, is the man’s to achieve]. There are hints in this statement for the visionary thinkers.
Ask the believers to [be patient with and] forgive the shortsightedness of the disbelievers who do not believe in the Day of Judgment. [God will reward them for their patience and punish the disbelievers Himself as] God will fully pay for whatever each person has earned.
If you do a good deed, your soul will benefit from it and if you do an evil deed, you will bear its burden. You will all return one Day to face your Lord.
I (God) gave the Jews the Scripture, Divine criteria for judgment and Prophet hood. I showered them with good things of life and made them superior [in account of their prescribed style of life] to other nations.
I gave them clear instructions in dealing with their affairs. Once they got the knowledge, they started to dispute among themselves [scientific jealousy]! Indeed your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection [regarding their short sightedness].
Now I am passing the law to you. Follow it and do not follow the laws of the others who [in spite of all their claims] do not have [God’s] knowledge.
[If you make any change in the law to please them,] God’s anger upon you can not be stopped by them. The wrongdoers ally together; God allies with the righteous ones [what an imbalance of alliance].
The law is a beacon for the entire humanity. Only those who believe will receive guidance from this Mercy.
Do wrongdoers expect that I (God) will treat them in the same way that I treat the believers, who do good deeds? Can their life and death be equal? If so, they are wrong.
God has created the heavens and the earth based upon the Law so that each soul be justly rewarded for what it has earned. There will be no injustice in the Court of God.
Have you ever noticed a person who has made his whims his God [and has become a slave to his lust] in spite of his knowledge? God [in response] makes his hearing, sight and mind insensitive to the truth. Who can help such a person? Would you not then be mindful?
The disbelievers say: “We only live this life; as time goes, by we become old and die.” They have no knowledge about the subject and their saying is merely a guess.
When MY clear Revelations are recited to them, their only response is: “Bring our forefathers back to life, if you are truthful.”
Tell them that the same God Who brings them to life and takes their lives away will gather together [and not individually as they are jokingly asking for] on the Day of Resurrection. This will surely take place but most people do not know that [as most people do not know the future].
God [has created and] governs over the heavens and the earth [therefore he is capable of re-creating it again]. When the Resurrection takes place, the worshippers of falsehood will be doomed to loss.
You will see every nation [including the stubborn disbelievers] will [be so overtaken by the occasion that they will] fall kneeling before God. They will review their deeds. They will be told: “Today you will be rewarded according to your deeds.”
“Look at your actions; they are recorded as they happened.”
As for those who believed and did good deeds, The Lord will let them admit them to His mercy; this will be the greatest achievement.
As for those who disbelieved, your Lord will say: “Were not My Revelations recited to you? What a shame that you showed arrogance and chose to become criminals.
Remember when it was said that: “God’s promises is true and the upcoming Resurrection is inevitable” you used to recourse to any excuse saying: “We are not sure about it, we do not know when it will happen and how can we accept something that has not happened on the basis of a guess?”
Then they will realize that what they were doing was wrong and whatever they were mocking at will come back to haunt them.
God will then say: “Today I forget about you as you forgot about your being held responsible on this Day of Judgment. Your abode is the Hellfire and nobody is going to help you.”
“This is because you took the word of God lightly and were too involved with the worldly affairs.” They will never get out of the Hell and their excuses will not heard.
Only God is worthy of Praise: the Lord of the heaven, the Lord of the earth and the Lord of the entire universe.
To Lord is Glory throughout the heavens and the earth. God is Almighty, the Most Wise.
H.M.
This book is revealed by God, the Most powerful, the Most Wise.
There is a rational and high purpose in the creation of the heavens and the earth. The whole universe has a destiny and will be recalled back one day. What a pity that the disbelievers do not care about God’s warnings.
Ask them: “Have you ever seen with your own eyes those whom you consider as gods instead of God? Show me what they have created in this world. Do these imaginary gods have any share in the creation and the control of the universe? Are these gods of yours mentioned in any scriptures sent down before Qur’an? Do you have any reference to the teaching of previous Prophets regarding the existence of more then one Creator? Show your references, if you are truthful.
Who is more unjust to himself than the one who worships gods [in any form or shape] who can not answer their prayers [by the virtue of their limitation] as long as the world last. As a matter of fact they are not even aware that they are being worshipped.
On the Day of Judgment, the same idols that were being worshipped will turn to be the enemies of their worshippers and testify against them in the court of Almighty!
Whenever My (God’s) clear revelations are recited to the disbelievers, they realize the truth; but instead of submission they call Qur’an a “plain magic!”
Do they mean by “plain magic” that the Prophet himself has fabricated the Qur’an. If so, tell them: “If I have fabricated the Qur’an, God is going to punish me and none of you can save me. God knows that your accusations are baseless and He will be judge between you and me. God is the Most Forgiving [so take advantage of it as the door is still open], the Most Merciful [that He still gives you time.]
Tell people: “I am not different from other Prophets. I do not know what will happen to you or me. I only follow what God has revealed to me. My only mission is to relay the message.”
Tell them: “Just for the sake of argument, suppose for a moment that Qur’an is a revelation from God and you deny it; [what a terrible destiny awaits you then]. A Jewish scholar among you has already declared that Qur’an is a true revelation of God and you are still stubborn in facing the truth! Know that God does not guide such unjust people.”
The disbelievers say to the believers: “If Qur’an was any good, they [a bunch of young and poor converse] would not be at the forefront [our leaders and “noblemen” would have accepted it first].” As disbelievers are not guided by Qur’an, they refer to it as “a fabrication like the false ones before.”
Before the revelation of Qur’an, God reveled Torah to Moses as a guidance in account of His Mercy. This Qur’an is the confirmation of [the authentic] Torah [which was lost long before] in Arabic in order to warn the wrongdoers and to give good news to the righteous ones.
As a matter of fact, those who say,” God is our only Lord” and lead a God pleasing life will have nothing to fear nor to be sad about.
They will be the inhabitants of Paradise who will live there forever. This is their reward for their good deeds.
God hereby orders man to treat his parents with kindness. Especially the mother who went through lots of hardship in carrying the unborn baby inside her, then suffered a lot while giving birth and gave milk to the baby for some thirty months. When the child grows up and becomes mature, at the age of forty, he should say: “O Lord, direct me to appreciate the blessings that you have showered me and my parent with and enable me to engage in God pleasing deeds. May you let my children to grow up righteous too. I turn to you and I submit myself to your will.”
I will accept such person’s good deed and cover his wrongdoings. Such person will inhabit in Paradise as I have truly promised.
As for the one who mocks his parent saying: “Do you want me to believe that I will be brought back to life after my death? How come none has been brought back out of so many generations before?” The parents will turn then to God to guide their child and say: “Please believe; God’s promise is true.” Such disbeliever will then say: “These none senses are ancient mythology!”
Disbelieving men and extra-terrestrials (Jinns) with such an attitude are already sentenced to punishment. Indeed they are the losers.
The severity of their punishment depends upon the severity of their deeds. God will render full justice.
When the disbelievers are thrown into the Fire, they will be told: “You lost your fair chances while you were on earth; so, taste the fruit of your uncalled for arrogance and wrongdoings.”
Recall that the brother of Ad (Hud) warned his people (as they were warned many times before and after this) saying: “Do not worship anyone but God. Indeed I am worried about the terrible punishment of a gloomy Day which is awaiting you.”
They replied: “Do you want to take away our gods [our style of life]. Go ahead; bring upon us the punishment that you are talking so much about.”
He said: “Only God knows when that Day will come; my only mission is to relay the message that I am commissioned for. What a shame that you take my warnings as a joke in your ignorance.”
When they saw that the punishment is approaching their valleys, they said: “Here comes the cloud with much needed rain in for us.” No way; it is the punishment that you were challenging your Prophet to bring upon you.
It will destroy everything by the will of its Lord. So, nothing left behind except the ruins of their empty places. This is the way that I (God) deal with guilty people.
I had given them much more than I have given you. But they closed their ears, eyes and hearts to the truth and denied the revelations of their Lord. Consequently, they got exactly the same punishment that they were mocking at.
I have destroyed many nations around you [in Arabian Peninsula]. I sent my messages to them over and over again in various ways so that they might stop wrongdoings.
Why their idols did then abandoned them instead of helping them? That is because those gods were fake; invented by their imaginations.
I (God) led a group of extra-terrestrials (Jinns) to one of your Qur’an recitation sessions. When they arrived, they listened carefully. Then they returned to their people as Warner.
They reported: “We have just listened to the recitation of a Book that…
has been sent down after Moses. It contains the previous scriptures [lost throughout the time] and is a guidance to the truth; to the right path. We urge you, our people, to accept the invitation of the one who calls us to believe in God. By doing so, God will forgive your sins and will save you from a painful punishment.”
There is no escape for those who fail to respond to God’s call. After all [whether they accept or not], their Lord is God. They are indeed wrong.
Do they not realize that God (Who created the entire universe without any pain) is capable of summon them back to life? Indeed God is capable of doing whatever He wills.
The Day the disbelievers are led to the Fire, they will be asked: “Is not this the Truth?” They will say: “By our Lord, indeed it is the Truth.” God will say: “Then taste the fruit of your denying the Truth.”
Be patient (O Mohammad), as the Prophet before you endured the patience and do not be in a hurry to see the punishment that inevitable will overtake them. When the Day comes, it will seem to them that it was only an hour ago that they were living on earth! Now the message has been delivered. Only the evil doers will be destroyed.
The “good actions” of the disbelievers, who pave any other way but the path of their Lord, will not please God.
God will forgive the sins of those who accept the Oneness of God, do good things and believe that what is revealed to Mohammad is God’s word. The Lord promises to improve these believers’ condition.
The reason for such an attitude of God is that the disbelievers are following the wrong path and the believers follow their Lord’s order. God is using these examples to bring to the attention of the people the result of their actions and attitudes.
If you are engaged in a war with disbelievers, fight with them bravely and strike their necks. When the war is over, you may chose to free the captives or ask for a ransom for their freedom. Know that if God wanted, he would have made you victorious without any fight. The Lord simply wants to test you by one another to prove to you how sincere you are in your belief. Be sure that God will never forget the sacrifice of those who offered their lives as a proof of their belief to their Creator.
God hereby promises to guide His true believers and improve their conditions.
And will admit them to the Paradise with which they are already familiar [through the word of God].
Know that, if the believers help God [how generous of the One Who does not need help to consider a person’s move toward Him as help], God will help them in return and will strengthen their foothold.
As to disbelievers, their “good” deeds will be fruitless and for them there is nothing but misery in reserve.
That is because, they denied the word of God [and preferred the existing corrupt order] and in return God did not accept their charitable actions [As a matter of fact paying “charity” so that a man stays a pagan is not only a charity but a bribe].
Have they not traveled to see the unfortunate destiny of those nations who challenged their Creator? God destroyed their works; their destiny is a good example for what is waiting for the disbelievers.
Know that God is the Protector and Helper of the believers; the disbelievers do not have neither any protector nor a helper.
God will admit those who believe and do good deeds into the Gardens where the river flows beneath them. As to the disbelievers, they are enjoying an animalistic life and will end up in the Hell.
I (God) destroyed many stronger nations, than the one which made you to leave your hometown; there was none to save them.
Are those, who are enlightened by God, equal to those who think that their wrongdoings [as defined by God Himself] are the best possible deed and follow none but their low desires?
Think of the promised Paradise to the righteous ones as a place with unpolluted rivers of water, streams of fresh milk, as well as clear honey, and the canals of delightful wine. In Paradise there will be fruits of every kind for the (successful) ones and [perhaps the greatest blessing] they will be forgiven by God [and their forgiven sins will never be brought up to their attention to make them feel bad amidst such a pleasant place]. Can such (successful) people be equal to the permanent residents of the Fire whose intestines will be torn up by the boiling water that they drink?
Some disbelievers listen to your sermons and, after they leave, they jokingly, ask: “What in the Heaven was he talking about?” God [in response to their jokes] seals their heart and, in consequence, they will follow their lowly desires.
As for those who [listen to your sermons and] get guidance, God guides them further and leads them to the righteousness.
Are they waiting till their resurrection [when they will have no time to repent]? They are only one step away from it. When they are resurrected, what chance will they find to listen and take advantage of the God’s message?
Know it well that there is none worthy of worship but God. Ask forgiveness for your sins, as well as the sins of the believing men and women. God is watching you in public and in the privacy of your own homes.
The believers were used to ask, “Why God does not send a verse to let us fight [to protect ourselves]?” But when a decisive verse about the right to fight was sent down, you saw, those who harbored doubt in their hearts, looking at you as though the shadow of death is hanging over them.
Obedient and righteous by word! If they knew how beneficial it would have been for them to fight when God asked them to do so.
[Now that you are questioning the Lord’s commands,] What else is next? Turning back to the days of ignorance, starting mischief on earth and mistreating your relatives?
These [hypocrites] deserve the curse of God. That is why God has made them deaf and blind [to the truth].
Why do they not study Qur’an carefully? Do their brains not functioning?
The fact of the matter is that Satan has enticed those who turn back to the ignorance, after having exposed to the Divine Guidance.
That is why they said to those who hate God’s message that: “We agree with some of your ideas.” They can not hid their secret conspiracies from God.
When the Angles take their souls, they will beat them on their faces and kick their rear ends.
That is because, they turned away from the things that pleases God and adapted a way of life that made God angry at them. All their deeds therefore turned fruitless.
Those who have a disease [of doubt] in their hearts, do they really think that God will not expose them?
If I (God) will, I can mark their faces to be recognizable. However, you can easily recognize them by the way that they argue. God is aware of what you all do.
I will certainly put you to the test so that you may have an opportunity to show your real selves; so that you show your patience and struggle in the way of God.
Those who embraced Islam and then denied the truth, prevented the others to walk on the way of their Lord and disputed with the Prophet of God, can in no way harm God. On the contrary, God will render their deeds null.
O’ you who have believed, obey God and His Prophet; otherwise all your deeds will be fruitless.
As for those who choose the disbelief, prevent the others [physically, verbally or psychologically] to follow the way of God and die in the state of disbelief, God will never forgive them.
Do not surrender for the sake of peace as God has guaranteed the victory for you. God is with you; He will never let your struggle to go in vain.
Know that the life of this world is nothing but a game and an entertainment. If you believe and lead a righteous life, God will reward you without asking a price for it.
If God had ever asked for an excessive charity from you, you might have turned stingy and showed your evil side.
You are invited to spend [as generously as you can] in the way of God. Among you they are some who are stingy. The stingy ones are indeed stingy toward their own soul. Know that God is rich: It is you who are poor. If you turn away, God will replace you by another people and they will definitely will not be like you.
Indeed God has blessed you with a great victory.
May Your Lord forgive your past shortcomings, as well as your future faults, and bless you with His most favor and keep you in the right path.
May God shower you with His mighty help.
Your Creator is the One Who send “peace” upon you so that your faith in Him increases. Know that God, to Whom belongs all forces existing in the heavens and in the earth, is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
God promises to forgive the sins of those male and female who believe in Him and take them to the gardens of Paradise where the streams flow in it so that they live there forever. This indeed is the biggest success [not the success in materialistic achievements in this world]
As to the male and the female disbelievers and hypocrites who entertain evil thoughts about their Lord, they earn nothing but the curse and the anger of God and a sever punishment is in reserve for them in Hell.
Know that the forces of the heavens and the earth is at the disposition of God; the Almighty, the Most Wise.
God has sent (Mohammad) to you as a witness to give you good news and to warn you of the consequences of you evil acts.
May you believe in One and Only One God and His Prophet (Mohammad) and honor your Lord and glorify Him every morning and evening.
Those who shook your hands [in Hudaibiyah as a pledge to fight for their faith with you till the end], were indeed renewing their pledges with God; the “Hand” of God is over their hand! Whoever break his pledge, however, breaks it at his own peril. Whoever, keeps his pledge, God will soon grant him a great reward.
Those Arabs [in south of Medina], who did not join you, will ask you to pray for their forgiveness on the basis of lame excuses. They [do not feel any remorse in their failure to accompany you and] are not sincere. Say: “God is fully aware of your actions….
My prayer will not help you at all, if He decides to punish you. The fact of the matter is that you were proud of the wisdom of your action in saving yourselves from the danger into which Mohammad and his supporting believers were going. You are indeed a sinful doomed people.”
For those who do not believe in God and the prophet hood of Mohammad, I (God) have prepared a blazing Fire.
To His Majesty belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God may forgive or punish whoever He wills. [Take advantage of these few remaining days of your lives and return in all sincerity to God as] God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
When you start easier campaigns in the future, which promises to be profitable [which happened only three months later in the occasion of Khaibar’s campaign], the same people who left you alone will ask you to let them go with you! Tell them plainly: “God has already decreed that you should not follow us.” In reply they will say: “You are jealous of us!” [What does one thing have to do with the other?] They simply do not get it.
Tell those who did not join you that: “Pretty soon God will give you the opportunity to fight with a mighty people until they submit. [This will be your last chance.] If you join (this dangerous fight), God will give you a good reward. If you turn your back (as you did before), God will severely punish you.
The one who has a genuine excuse (being blind, lame or sick) for not joining the fight, is not accountable. Whoever obeys God and His Prophet, God will admit him into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. The One who turns away, on the contrary, will be severely punished by his Lord.
God was well pleased with those believers who renewed their pledge under the tree [in Hudaibiyah]. God knew what was going in their hearts [that they were sure to be massacred]. God, therefore, put peace in their hearts and has already rewarded them with upcoming victories.
Very soon they will win a victory which will bring them lots of wealth [as it happened three months later in the Khaibar campaign]. God is Almighty, the Most Wise.
God promises you lots of wealth which you will acquire in other victories. At this time, God has restrained the disbelievers (of Mecca Who had the upper hand in Hudaibiyah) from attacking you which is a great victory by itself. May this victory be a sign to the believers and that God guide you to the right path.
As for the enemy that you could not possibly defeat them [most probably the mighty disbelievers of Mecca], God has already taken care of them [and it is only the matter of time]. Know that God is capable of doing anything.
If the (mighty) disbeliever of Mecca had decided to fight with you [in Hudaibiyah], they would have surely been defeated as they did not have any protector or helper.
This [final defeat of the disbelievers] is a tradition set by your Lord and you will not find any change in God’s policy
It is God Who prevented the fight in the valley of Mecca [in Hudaibiyah for a divine reason] after He had given the victory [which was considered as a humiliating defeat by most Muslims] and God was observing your behavior [the agony of what you were considering it as a defeat].
The disbelievers prevented you from performing your pilgrimage and sacrificing the animals, where they should be sacrificed. Had there not been certain believing men and women (in Mecca), whom you do not know, and the possibility of you killing them unintentionally at the midst of the confusion of the war, God would not have stopped your victorious capture of Mecca. God prevented the war [among other reasons, to give more time to disbelievers to weight it out and] to admit into His Mercy whoever He desires. If the believers were not in the middle of disbelievers, God would have severely punished the disbelievers.
While the disbelievers’ heart was filled with the arrogance of the days of ignorance, God showered His Prophet and the believers with peace and directed them toward righteousness as they deserved it. God is Fully Aware of everything.
Indeed the Prophet of God has dreamed the reality: “You will God willing (surely) enter the Sacred Mosque [founded by Abraham and Ishmael in Mecca], head shaved or hair shorten, to perform your pilgrimage in peace and with no fear. God knows what you do not know; therefore, He has postponed this victory at hand, for a while.
God is the One Who has sent His Prophet with the Guidance [Qur’an] and the Religion of Truth that He may make it prevail over all religions. [It does not matter what others think,] God Himself is enough of a witness for this truth.
Mohammad, the Messenger of God, and his believing followers are hard on the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. You will find them always worshipping their Lord by humbling themselves in bowing down and falling in prostration seeking God’s blessing and approval. They have the distinctive mark of prostration [the halo] on their faces as explained in Torah [Deuteronomy, 33:2-3 and other verses which unfortunately is lost!] and in the (original) Gospel [part of it in Mathew, 13:31-they have been likened to plants that grow taller and stronger and please the farmers; thus enraging the disbelievers. God promises forgiveness and a good reward to those who believe and do good deeds.
Those who believe should never challenge God and His messenger with their opinion. You should treat the Lord with the utmost respect; beware that God knows everything and hears everything you say.
The believers should never raise their voice above the voice of the messenger of God. You should not shout at the messenger the same way that you shout at each other. Those who do not follow this protocol have rendered their good works null.
Those who follow these rules will have God’s forgiveness and a big reward for the goodness of their nature.
Those who invade the privacy of the messenger, calling him with a loud voice from behind the walls, have no sense at all.
It would have been nice of them to respect the privacy of the messenger of God and wait till he comes out of his house to conduct the business. However, God is Forgiving and Merciful.
The Muslims should be more careful about the source of the news that they receive and should not react immediately to what they hear. It is better to take advantage of the benefit of the doubt.
Remember that the Prophet of God is among you. [Given the fact that the prophet has the divine connection and knows some things better than you,] Had he listened to you in many of your (democratically arrived at) decisions, you would have certainly been in trouble. Fortunately God has put the belief in your hearts and, consequently, you resent disbelief, wrongdoing and disobedience [of God and His Prophet and that is why you will succeed].
This is, indeed, God’s grace and favor to you; know that God is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
If two parties among you (for some reason) engage in fight, God orders you to do your best in order to restore peace between them. If one party continues the aggression, you all should all team up to fight with them [the basis for the United Nations of today’s Muslim countries]. If they submit and returns to the peace table, you should reconcile the two parties (and not continue the fight to punish them). Establish an honorable peace between them and know that God loves just people.
Remember that the believers are like brothers to other. Therefore, establish peace between your brothers and be mindful of God; may God shower you with His Mercy.
It is forbidden for the believer men or women to make fun of each other as the ones that you are laughing at may be better than you in eyes of God. Do not mock at each other and do not call each other by funny names. It is an evil thing to call names after conversion to Islam. Those who continue doing so are indeed wrongdoers.
It is forbidden for the believers to have an extremely suspicious mind. Some kind of suspicions are indeed sins. Do not spy on each other [peeping into the neighbor’s house, opening one’s private letters, listening to the private conversations, etc.] and do not backbite one another [this is as detestable as eating your dead brother’s flesh]; is there any among you who would like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Indeed none. Be mindful of God as He accepts the repentance; He is the Most Merciful.
The mankind should know that I (God) created them from a man and a woman and then put you into different tribes and nations so that you may associate with each other. Know that the honorable among you in the sight of God is the most pious one and God [knows who is the pious ones as He] is the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
The Arabs say: “We are believers.” Tell them : “You have not believed yet; you may simply claim that you are Muslims (submitted to God). It is a long way for faith to penetrate inside your heart. If you obey God and His Prophet, He will not diminish anything [in account of your lack of absolute belief] from the reward promised for your good deeds as God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
The true believers are those who do not have the least doubt about God and His Prophet and are absolutely sincere in giving up their wealth and lives to please their Lord.
Let them who offer their lip services know that God knows about everything in the heavens and on the earth; God has absolute knowledge of everything.
They think they have done a favor by becoming a Muslim. Let them know that God has done a favor to them by guiding them toward the Faith; they will be grateful for such a favor, if they are really sincere in their faith.
God knows every secret in the heavens and in the earth; God sees whatever you do.
Q; God, hereby, swears to this very glorious Qur’an.
Why should disbelievers consider it weird that God, out of mercy, has chosen a person from among themselves to relay His message to them?
The disbelievers wonder, how after being turned into dust, one day they will be raised to be questioned about what they have done while living on earth.
God already knows how many of them the earth has devoured as everything is registered and preserved (say like a video tape).
What a shame that the disbelievers reject a truth, revealed to them, out of sheer ignorance.
How can they deny God’s word when they can easily look up in the sky and see the majesty of their Lord Who has created the heavens, has adorned it with the stars and haps put the most accurate mechanism foot the universe to function?
Can not they look around and see the earth that God has spread out with mountains and marvelous…
species that grow in it and appreciate God’s realm of creation?
Can not they appreciate the rain that I (God) send down from the sky….
to produce for them gardens of fruits, fields of grains and tall palm trees with range clusters of date as their provision? For the same token that God brings to life a dead land, one Day…
He will bring you back to life.
Disbelieving before them were the people of Noah, Rass and Thamud.
As well as Ad, Pharaoh and the brothers of Lot.
And the Dwellers of the Wood and the people of Tubba. Every one of them denied My Prophets until my punishment was proven to be true to them.
The same God that has created the existing universe and ordered, is He not capable of resurrect you? [The astronomers suggest that: if there is enough matter in the universe, once every few tens of billion years the matter in universe is being condensed and a new Big Bang creates a new universe.]
I have created man and know very well what evil thoughts he entertains inside himself. As a matter of fact, I (God) am closer than his jugular vein to man.
To each man two angles (known as right hand side and left hand side) are appointed to register his deeds.
Not even a word spoken is being missed in their registration.
The whole truth starts to reveal itself as soon as the agony of death touches the person. The same death that you were trying to escape.
When the horn is blown, it will be the Day that you have been promised.
Every soul will be brought to face his Lord by a driver accompanied by a lifelong witness.
God will say: “You were caring less for this day. Now that the veil is removed, you can see clearly.
Man’s companion will then say: “Here is the one that you put me in charge of.”
It will be commanded: “Throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever.”
“Who was full of doubt, forbidding charity and passed the bounds of morality in everything he did.”
“The one who had adopted other lords beside the Lord, give him the worse punishment of the Hell.”
His companion (Satan) will say: “Our Lord, I did not misled him, he himself (in his freedom of choose) chose to rebel.”
God will say: “Do not dispute at my presence, I have sufficiently warned you.”
“My sentence is final. I am not unjust to my servants [to forgive their enemies].
On that Day, when your Lord asks Hell, “Are you full?”, the Hell will reply, “Is there any more?”
Paradise will be brought closer to the righteous one so that he may not take an extra effort to walk toward.
They will be told: “This is what was promised to you; to every one who sincerely repented to his Lord and submitted to His Laws.”
“To every one who minded his Lord, the unseen and submitted with a sincere devotion.”
“Enter with peace in Paradise as this is the beginning of your eternal life.”
They will be given anything that they desire as well as additional unexpected rewards.”
I (God) have destroyed many nations before them. They were much stronger (not only in their own land) and had brought other nations under their domination. Where can then these (weak people) find a refuge (if God decides to punish them)?
Indeed there is a lesson in this for the one who is conscious and have an ears which carefully listens.
I (God) am the One Who created this universe in six period without getting exhausted and loosing My Power.
Deal with patience with the disbelievers and let them say whatever nonsense they may and worship your Lord before sunrise and before sunset
as well as during night and after formal prayers.
Get ready for the Day that a caller will call you closely to raise up from death.
That will be the Day that all the people will be hearing the true call and will get out death.
It is I (God) who give life and death and to Me you will all return on that Day.
On that Day the earth will crack down and the people will rush out of it in hast. This resurrection is indeed easy for your Lord.
Indeed I (God) know what the disbelievers say. You (Mohammad) are not in a position to oblige them to embrace Islam. Your only task is to admonish those who mind my warnings with this Qur’an.
Your Lord swears by the blowing winds.
Your Lord swears by those clouds that are carrying a heavy mass of water.
Your Lord swears by those clouds that glide with ease.
Your Lord swears by those clouds that distribute their water equally throughout their trip by the order of the Almighty.
That whatever your Lord has promised will take place.
That one day you will be questioned for what you have done in your life.
In spit of the fact that you observe the majestic heaven, which God has created with many trajectories in it,…
you keep disputing the truth that He has revealed to you!
God, therefore, will turn away from those who have chosen to deny their Creator.
Doomed are those who choose their religion based upon guesses and incomplete evidences.
Who are deeply ignorant and careless about their religion.
They jokingly ask: “When will be the Day of Judgment? Why does not it happen soon, if it is true?]”
The answer is: “When they will be thrown into the Fire.”
They will be told: “Taste the result of your mischief. This is the event that you wanted to take place soon.”
On that Day, the righteous ones will be welcomed to the gardens with water springs.
They will joyfully receive the reward that their Lord will give them for doing good deeds in their worldly lives.
They cut their sleeping at night short to worship their Lord.
And around dawn ask their Lord for forgiveness.
And gave a part of their wealth to the needy ones (whether the latter asked for it or not) realizing that what they own is not completely theirs.
Earth is full of signs [indicating the existence of God, Oneness of God, hasting toward a doomed destiny, etc.] for those who believe.
In your own selves, too, the believer find many signs to strengthen their faith.
Your provision, as well as whatever is promised to you [destiny, talent, new discoveries, achievements, etc.], is already decided in the heaven.
By the Lord of Heaven [the world of unseen] and the earth [materialistic world] whatever you have heard is as true as any truth that you speak yourself about.
Have you ever heard the story of the Abraham’s honored guests? 
When they [angles appearing like human beings] reached him they wished peace for him. Abraham returned their salutation saying: “Peace also be with you my noble stranger guests.”
He asked his family to roast a fat cow for his guests.
When they did not touch the food, Abraham asked “Do not you want to eat?”
As they refused to eat, fear overtook him. The angles said: “Do not be afraid, we are here to give you a good news: Pretty soon God will give you a wise and knowledgeable son.”
His wife, overhearing them, came out (struck her forehead) saying: “From an old and barren woman like me?”
They said: “That is what your Lord has decided; He is the Most Wise, the Most Knowledgeable.”
Abraham asked then: “It sounds that you have come to accomplish an important mission.”
They replied: “We are sent to punish the guilty people [of Prophet Lot].”
“To shower them with hot clays.”
“Each stone being marked by Lord to punish a specific sinner.”
“Another mission of ours is to evacuate the town from believers.”
“But we have found only one Muslim (submitted to God) household [Lot’s household].”
“We set it up as an example for those who do not want to face the punishment of the Lord.”
And the story of Moses whom God sent with the most clear signs to Pharaoh.
But Pharaoh rejected did not believe in those miracles out of pride and said: “This man is either crazy or a magician.”
Then I (God) punished him and his army by casting them into the sea. He is the one to be blamed for his fate.
And the story of Ad whom God sent a disastrous wind to his guilty people.
Which destroyed anything on its path.
And the story of Thamud when they were told: “You are given only a short time to enjoy [may you take advantage of it and change] your style of life.”
As they continued to challenge their Lord, they were overtaken by a sudden thunderbolt.
They did not even have time to stand up and run.
And the story of Noah’s people whom I destroyed as they were so wicked.
I (God) have created the universe myself and will continue to expand it [confirmation of the expansion theory of the universe after the Big Bang.]
I have made the earth habitable for its inhabitant; excellently designed [eco-system].
I have put a pair of everything in it so that you may wonder about the creative power of your Creator.
Tell them: “Take refuge in God; I (Mohammad) am sent to you as His Warner.”
“Do not set up another God [idol, boss, money, woman, etc.] to worship beside Him; I am sent to you as His Warner.”
This is a trend: whenever a Prophet is sent to a people, they would say: “He is a crazy magician.”
Is it because they have arrived to such after a rational debate? Indeed not. The fact of the matter is that such accusations are the natural reactions of rebellious people.
So, forget about them. Your job has been to relay the message. You (Mohammed) are not responsible for their behaviors.
Continue admonishing; the believers will benefit from the admonition.
I have created men and extra-terrestrials (Jinns) to serve only me [not a ruler, a woman, a constitution, etc.]
I (God) do not need any provision from them, nor do I ask them to feed Me.
On the contrary, God, the supreme and the Most Powerful, is the One Who provides provision for his creatures.
The sinners will have the same destiny as those who sinned before them. Tell them not to jokingly ask Me to accelerate it.
What a miserable Day will be when the disbelievers face their fate.
I (God) swear by the Mount Sinai.
And this Qur’an which is already written and preserved in a….
safe place in an unfolded scroll.
And by this house (Kaba in Mecca built by Abraham for the worship of God) which is being visited by so many people.
And the elevated canopy.
And by the swollen ocean
Have no doubt about the coming of the day of…
judgment that no one can escape it.
On the day that the heaven will move from…
side to side and the mountains will be wiped out.
Grief and sorrow on that day to disbelievers who wasted their life by entering into….
vain discourse and took serious matters lightly.
The day on which they will be dragged violently to the Hellfire.
They will be told:” This is the Fire that you were denying.”
“Do you think this is magic? Can you see now what you were rejecting?”
Burn now. whether you bear it or not, this is your destiny. You are simply being rewarded according to your deeds.
The righteous ones will end up in garden enjoying heavenly joy.
Their Lord will save them from the punishment of Hell and let them rejoice in Heaven.
“Eat and drink free of charge as a reward for your worldly deeds.”
Reclining on luxurious furnishings, face to face they will enjoy each others company; they will be wedded to pure spouses with beautiful eyes.
I (God) will join in paradise those who have believed with their offspring, who have followed their footsteps in faith. No one will be deprived of the reward for his deeds. The man’s soul [which is a collateral for what God has offered him in this world as a debt], will be freed of his debt.
I (God) will provide them [free of charge] with any fruit or meat that they may desire.
They will be passed hand to hand cups of drinks which will not intoxicate them and, therefore, they will never behave indecently or use abusive language.
They will have appointed young servants who will be as lovely as well-guarded pearls.
They will talk to each other about their worldly lives saying:
“While living among our folks, we were not obsessed with accumulating the wealth and our financial security.
That is why God has been so kind to us and has saved us from the hot winds of poisonous gases of Hell.
God was the Only One Whom we turned to; indeed He is the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
Go on and guide them to the right path. By the grace of your Lord, you are neither a wizard nor a mad man.
They say: “Mohammad is a poet, insulting our idols; we are waiting so that pretty soon he will be subjected to a miserable end by our gods.”
Tell them: “Wait, I will be waiting too.”
Are these contradictory accusations [calling Mohammad an intelligent poet and at the same time a mad man, for example] the fruit of their thoughts or the manifestation of their wicked nature?
While they know that Mohammad is not capable of coming up with such a superior work like Qur’an, is their insistence upon this accusation not a sign of their wickedness?
If they really believe that a man is capable of producing a book like this, then challenge them to produce a similar book, if they are sincere about what they are saying.
Do they think that they are created out of nothing? Are they their own creators?
Have they created heavens and the earth? The fact of the matter is that they are sure of nothing; they have no faith.
Do they possess the treasures of your Lord? Do they have control over anything?
Have they any ladder to climb up to heaven and listen directly to their Lord [as they deny the authenticity of the message relayed to them by the Messenger]. If so, what have they heard? Do they have any proof?
If they claim to hear from God, how come they assign daughters to God while they kill their own daughters as it is beneath their “dignity” to have nothing but son.
Does our prophet ask for a wage for his mission that they are afraid of paying for him?
Do they have the knowledge of the unseen realities that they flatly refuse it?
Do they constantly devise secret plots against our prophet? Let them know that those who devise devilish plots, their plots always backfires.
Do they have any other God beside God? Glory to God, far above having a partner.
Even a great miracle such as falling a part of the sky will be justified by them as “a mass of cloud advancing.”
So let them in their disbelief till the Day that they will be struck down.
On that day their plots will not protect them; nothing will protect them.
Even before that Day, they will be subject to misfortunes without understanding it.
Be patient till you are given the victory. God is watching over His Prophet. Glorify and praise your Lord when you wake up.
Also glorify Him at night as well as at the retreat of stars [before dawn].
I (God) swear by the star when it goes down (explode and throw its energy back to the universe creating a nova: The most awesome happening in the universe.)
That your fellow citizen (Mohammad) is neither wrong nor misled.
Nor does he speak out of his whim.
This Qur’an is a revelation from the Creator.
Taught to him ( Mohammad) by God himself…
: The possessor of absolute authority ….
who approached from….
the farest point..
of the universe…
to reveal His Message.
The Mohammad’s mind did not make what he saw up.
Do you dispute with Mohammad and doubt about what he saw?
Indeed he (Mohammad) saw him (Angle Gabriel) for the second time by the furthest Lote-tree….
in the Garden (beyond which none will pass).
Where the eternal paradise is located.
The Lote-tree was shrouded.
His eyes did not blink while looking straight.
And he saw the greatest manifestations of His Lord.
Have you ever thought about the reality of your “gods”:…
Lot, Uzza and Manat?
Do you choose sons [and kill your new born girls as you consider them disgraceful] while calling these things as God’s daughters?
How disgraceful of you.
These concepts that you and your forefathers have invented are simply none senses. God has never sanctioned it. The fact of the matter is that these people simply follow their lusts in spite of the fact that the Lord’s guidance is offered to them.
Should man’s whims be materializes.
No way. It is only the will of God which will be fulfilled in this world, as well as, in Hereafter.
No matter how many angles [which are so beloved by God] pray for God’s mercy for a person, their prayer may not be beneficial for that person unless God himself decides to grant it in favor of whoever He wills and is pleased with.
Only disbelievers consider the Angles [who do not even have the power of intercession] as goddesses/ daughters of God [and in case of “holy spirit” as a part of God or God himself].
They do not have any knowledge about the nature of the Angles or unseen and just follow their guesses and guess is not a substitute for the truth.
God is hereby ordering you not to chose as a friend those who turn their backs to the laws of the Lord and seek nothing but the pleasure of this world.
The latter’ knowledge is limited only to this world [which is the subject of the study of science]. Only God knows the best who is following the right highway and who is walking in the back/dirt roads.
God is the only owner of everything which is in the heavens and the earth. He may reward the mischief makers with evil and the righteous ones with goodies.
The righteous ones are those who avoid great sins and shameful acts; occasionally falling prey to small sins. Indeed your Lord is generous in forgiving. He knows you the best as He is the One Who created you at first place and has observed you as embryos inside your mothers’ wombs. Therefore do not be proud of your “purity”: God alone knows best who is really pious and honors the God with the utmost respect.
Have you noticed the one who turned away from the God’s way…
and was stingy in charity?
Does such a person have knowledge about the future [that he should be stingy in charity as though it will not help him in the future]?
Has such a person not heard about what is mentioned [about charity] in the book sent down to Moses?
Has such a person not heard about what is mentioned in the book sent down to Abraham?
“That the responsibility of one person’s act can not be transferred to another person.”
“That man will be fully repaid for whatever he has done.”
That man’s effort will be appreciated.
That such a man will be fully paid.
Know that to your Lord is your final destiny.
Know that God is the One Who makes you laugh or cry.
Know that God is the One Who gives death and grants life.
Know that God is the One Who has created male….
and female from a tiny drop of sperm.
Know that such powerful Lord can bring you back to life.
Know that God is the One Who makes you rich or poor [for trial and maturity].
Know that God is the Lord of Galaxy Cyrus [as well as all other galaxies].
Know that God is the One Who destroyed the tribe of Ad [the rebellious people of Prophet Hud].
Know that God is the One Who wiped out the tribe of Thamud….
as well as the people of Noah before them who were most wicked and rebellious.
The evil communities [of Sodom & Gomorrah] had sunk to the lowest….
Consequently, ruins covered them up as you know.
Will you entertain the same doubt about your Lord and engage in what proved to be disastrous for the people before you?
This (Qur’an) is a warning, like the previous warnings.
The inevitable is imminent.
None beside God can remove the upcoming disaster from you.
Are you doubting it?
That you laugh at it instead of crying [for your miserable future] ?
Wasting your time in vanities.
Fall prostrate before God in worship and start serving Him.
The hour (of judgment) approaches as moon is being split.
The disbelievers, however, make fun of indications of God and refer to it as an act of magic.
They deny the Lord and follow their own (low worldly) desires. Every prescribed event, however, will take place when its time arrives.
The disbelievers have heard about the other prophets and it is easy for them to cross check the truth.
Unfortunately, they do not take these wise admonitions seriously.
Leave them alone then till they are called to face the awesome event.
They will come out of their graves with the most horrified eyes resembling to a bunch of locusts.
Towards facing their terrible destiny, they will say: “Indeed this is an awful day.”
The people of Noah, too, made fun of my servant. They called him a crazy man and ex-communicated him!
Noah (in despair) called upon his Lord: “I am overcome, would you come to my rescue”
So I (God) opened the gates of the sky and poured down the water.
As to the earth, I (God) gushed forth springs so that the water reached as high as desired.
I (God) carried Noah, then, on a bunch of planks fastened by palm fibers.
Under My watchful eyes, Noah floated to the safety. What a terrible punishment it was for the disbelievers.
This is left as a warning sign; is there anyone who minds an admonition?
How terrible was My (God’s) punishment after My warnings.
I (God) have made Qur’an easy to understand; is there anyone who minds an admonition?
The tribe of Ad also denied their prophet. How true was my warning and how awful my punishment.
Then one day I sent them a strong storm; a nasty storm that brought them nothing but misery.
The storm was tossing people around as though they were decayed palm tree trunks.
What a truthful warning and what a sever punishment.
I (God) have made Qur’an easy to understand; is there anyone who minds an admonition?
The tribe of Thamud also denied their warnings.
They said: “Are we crazy to follow a lonely person who is just a human being like us?”
“Is there no one better among us worthy of receiving God’s messages? Indeed this “prophet” is a liar who brags about his closeness to God”
Tomorrow they will find out who the liar is.”
“Tomorrow we will send a camel to try their obedience with. Watch their behavior with patience.”
Let them know that they have to share their spring water with the camel.”
Instead, They commissioned a clan member to kill the camel.
How terrible was My (God’s) punishment after My warnings.
I sent them only one blow which made them look like harvested hay.
I (God) have made Qur’an easy to understand; is there anyone who minds an admonition?
The people of Lot also denied their prophet’s warnings.
I (God) showered them with rocks. Only Lot’s family was saved at dawn.
I (God) blessed him and his family; this is the way that I reward the grateful ones.
Lot warned his people about God’s upcoming punishment but they made jokes and laughed at him.
They verbally abused Lot’s honorable guests. That is why, I made them blind: Suffer my punishment; you have been warned.
Then early next morning a disaster struck them.
Suffer my punishment; you have been warned.
I (God) have made Qur’an easy to understand; is there anyone who minds an admonition?
Pharaoh’s people were warned.
They denied all My Warnings. Consequently, I punished them in a manner that the Almighty Powerful punishes.
Do you disbeliever think that you are better than the ones before you? Is there any exemptions for you in the Scriptures?
Do they believe that by sticking together they will win?
Pretty soon you will show your back on flying .
They will see the real misery, however, on the Day of their Resurrection;… it is far worse and more painful.
The wicked people who have chosen the wrong path will be chained and dragged into Hell.
When they are thrown into fire, they will be told: Taste now the flame of Hell.”
I have created everything with a pre-destined fate.
It will take only a twinkle of an eye for My (God’s) command to be fulfilled.
I (God) have destroyed many like you as an example; is there anyone who wants to take a lesson?
Whatever done is registered in a Book.
The Book covers everything; no matter how grave or immaterial it seems to be .
As to those who minded their Lord, they will end up in gardens with the streams.
In a place of true honor: At the presence of the Most Powerful King.
The Most Gracious.
The One Who taught Qur’an (by His grace.)
The One Who created man.
The One Who gave the gift of speech to man.
The one who gave to the sun and to the moon the energy to move in motion.
Everything from] stars to trees are obeying the will of God.
He is the One Who extended the space and established the balance [the laws of the physics and morality].
Never upset the Lord’s balance.
Stick to the balance in your daily transactions and respect the right of the others.
He is the One Who made the earth hospitable for His creatures….
wherein you may find all kinds of tasty fruits in abundance and palms trees full of dates ….
and a variety of corn with husk [for the animals] and grains [for men].
Which manifestation of your Lord’s grace do you (men and extraterrestrials) deny?

Which manifestation of your Lord’s grace do you (men and extraterrestrials) deny?
He is the One Who extracts coral and pearl for you from these seas.

Every creature which exist on earth and in the heavens constantly ask Him for guidance and every moment He is being praise.

Pretty soon [men and extraterrestrial] burdens of earth will be summoned for their trials.

O’ you men and Jinns (extra-terrestrials), you can not travel beyond the boundaries of earth into the space without the power (of knowledge) given to you by God.

You will be bombarded by the projectiles of fire and metals which you can not pass through [without the great power].
Which manifestation of your Lord’s grace do you (men and extraterrestrials) deny?
The Day that the [ozone layer of the] sky is cracked down and its color is changed into red.
Which manifestation of your Lord’s grace do you (men and extraterrestrials) deny?
On that Day, there is no need to ask men and extra-terrestrials about their disobediences.

As the guilty ones will easily be recognized by their faces. They will be caught by their forelocks and by their feet and be dragged [to the Hellfire].
Which manifestation of your Lord’s grace do you (men and extraterrestrials) deny?
They will be told: “This is the same Hell that you, the guilty ones, were denying its existence.”
They will circulate around it and be thrown into the Fire.
Which manifestation of your Lord’s grace do you (men and extraterrestrials) deny?
As to the one who was always mindful of his Lord, there are two gardens [perhaps one for men and one for extra-terrestrials].

Containing all kinds of trees and delights.
Which manifestation of your Lord’s grace do you (men and extraterrestrials) deny?

Blessed is the name of your Lord, the Lord of Glory and Honor.
When the inevitable day of doom takes place.
In which there is no doubt about its happening.
Some people will be lowered and some raised in rank.
In that day the earth will be shaken up in a most sever manner.
And the mountains will be reduced..
to pieces of sands.
Then people will be ranked into three categories:
(A) [The good omen] People of the right hand. How fortunate are the people of the right hand.
(B) And the [misfortunate] people of the left hand. How unfortunate will be the people of the left hand.
(C) And the foremost [those who were always in the forefront in their response to God’s call] will be placed in the forefront….
They will be those nearest to God.
They will live in the Gardens of Paradise.
Most of them will be from those who responded to the God’s call earlier.
And a few from those who responded to the God’s call later.
They will be reclining on the luxurious furnishings,…
neighboring each other.
They will be properly served by….
eternal youths [perhaps those who died young] with nice cups and pitchers filled from….
a flowing spring which will neither intoxicate them nor cause them any hang over.
And they will present before them every kind of tasty fruit so that they may choose whichever they desire.
As well as the meat of any bird that they may desire.
They will wed beautiful-eyed women…
… as lovely as well-guarded pearls.
This is your Lord’s reward for their righteous deeds in their worldly lives.
They will be blessed by lack of profanities and sinful talks [no more lying, backbiting, slander, bragging, mockery, sarcasm, etc: a society of noble civilized people].
Only soothing, peaceful words would be exchanged among themselves.
And the people of the right hand; how fortunate will be the people of the right hand.
Surrounded by thorn less lote-trees.
Amid clustered plantations, fruitful banana trees and flowers piled one above another.
And extended shade.
And constantly flowing clean water.
And abundant fruits.
Always in supply and none forbidden.
And luxurious furnishing.
I (God) create for the people of the right side…
.. perfect matched…
… loving mates…
… who have never been touched before.
The right side people will be those …
… who joined the right path at the beginning and later.
And the people of the left hand; how unfortunate are the people placed on the left hand.
In the midst of hot wind and in boiling water.
In the shade of black smoke.
Neither refreshing nor cool.
They were people who used to have an easy and comfortable life before meeting this misfortune.
[but instead of being grateful to God,] engaged constantly in great sins.
They used to jokingly say: “When we die and turn into dust and bones, will we be raised up again?”
[Continuing their joke:] “How about our forefathers who died before?”
Say (Mohammad) to them:…
…. “Surely you and your forefathers all will be gathered together one day, the time of which is already determined by God.”
“Then you disbelieving deniers.”
“you have to eat the bitter fruit of a Hellish tree known as Zaqqum.”
“And fill your bellies with it.”
“And, on top of it, drink that boiling water…
… like a thirsty camel.”
“This is the way that they will be welcomed on the Day of Judgment.”
I (God) have created you; if you would have only believed.
Have you ever thought about the [”insignificant”] semen that you discharge?
Is it you who created it [and a child out of it] or the Creator?
[The same Creator Who created you] has predetermined your death; none can stop the will of God.
In order to replace you with a new generation and recreate you into a new kind of being that you do not know anything about its characteristics.
You have already witnessed (the miracle of) your own creation; why do not you believe [that God can perform the miracle of recreating you] then?
Have you ever thought about the seeds that you sow?
Is it you who [blow out of your spirit to] make them to grow? Is it not the Creator who makes them to grow?
If it is the Creator Who makes the crops to grow, the He may turn them into hay. Then you will cry:
“We lost.”
“We are deprived [of God’s blessing].”
Have you ever thought about the water that you [take for granted when you] drink?
Who made the water rain down from the sky for you? You or God?
If God had desired, He could have rained down salty water. Why are not you grateful [about the simplest things which are of the most importance for your survival]?
Have you ever thought the fire that you “make”? Who Created its wood [and its initial spark] ?....
You or the Creator?
God has given you the fire as a mean of thought and as a mean of your advancement [from animal level into a civilized intellectual being].
[After given these intellectually stimulating example, it is time that you] Glorify the name of your Lord, the Supreme.
No disbelievers; I (God) swear by the moment that the star explodes [and turns into a Nova].
And this is a tremendous oath, if you knew what I mean.
That this is the glorious Qur’an;
In a book well guarded by God.
Only purified ones may touch (grasp) it except the purified ones.
Sent down by the Lord of the worlds.
[After such a solemn oath] Do you regard it, then, as unworthy of serious attention?
Do you deny this truth of utmost importance simply because it may not be good for your business [that you have to close your idol worshipping temples, gambling casinos, sex shops, liquor stores, drug business, etc.]?
When [the moment of death arrive and] the soul reaches the throat.
And you see that the person is dying.
I am the closest to the dying person but you can not see.
If [as you claim] you are under no authority and you are truthful about…
… your claim, then go ahead and restore the soul.
If this dying person has [chosen the right path] been close to me, then he will be welcomed with joy,….
… peace and flowers entering to the Gardens of Paradise.
If he is a part of the people of the right hand, he will be greeted with “peace be with you” by them
If the dying person is of disbelievers….
…. and lost ones, then his entertainment will be….
…. boiling water and…
… burning in Hell.
All this is absolute truth.
Then glorify the name of your Lord; the Greatest One.
Anything in the heaven and earth in its own way glorifies God, the Mighty One, the Most Wise.
To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Lord is the One Who gives life and takes life away and He is capable of doing everything.
He is the First in the existence and He will be the Last Who will exist. He is the Outermost and He is the Innermost, He has the full knowledge of everything.
God is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods and then established His absolute authority over His realm of the creation. He knows what is penetrating into the earth and what is coming out of it. He knows everything which is descending from the sky and everything which is ascending toward it. God is with you wherever you are and He sees everything that you do.
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and He is in charge.
God turns the earth so that the day appear after the night and the night succeed the day. God is fully aware of everyone’s innermost thoughts.
Believe in God and His messenger and spend out of your wealth [which is given to you by God at first place] for the sake of pleasing Him. Those who believe and devote a part of their wealth to charity deserve a great reward from their Lord.
What is the matter with you that you do not believe in God at a time that you are privileged to have His prophet living among you, inviting you to walk on your Lord’s path? Have you forgotten your pledge at the moment of being converted into Islam? [the pledge being: “There is only one God & Mohammad is His Messenger.”]
The Most Kind and the Most Merciful is the One Who sends His Messages to His servant (Mohammad) to bring you out of the darkness’s into the light.
What is wrong with you that you do not spend money for charity to please your Lord? Are you afraid of poverty while you are pleasing the One Who owns the whole wealth of the universe and is the One Who provides you with wealth at first place? Do not you know that you can not take anything with you and that God eventually will inherit whatever you were afraid to spend a part of with to please Him? Those of you who spend a part of their money in charity before becoming rich and fight before victory are not equal to those who spend a part of their money after becoming rich and show their willingness in fight after victory! Although both are entitled to the reward, yet the formers are necessarily higher in rank than the latter. God is aware of whatever you do (and sees who has performed what deeds, under what kind of circumstances, and with what intention).
Who is the one who extend a loan to God [How generous of God to call calling it a loan while it is granted to the individual generously by Him at first place] with a good intention [to please the Lord] so that God return it back to him many folded and give him the best reward?
You will see a Day when the believing men and women surrounded by their luminous halo, inclined to their right side, rushing to meet their Lord. They will be told: “There is a good news for you today”. They will live forever in the Gardens beneath which the rivers flow. This is the “real success” [success in worldly affair such as wealth, position, family life, etc. are just means of test and trial.]
You will see on that Day that the hypocritical men and women will ask the believers to lean toward them so that they may share their lights. They will told: “Go away; seek your lights elsewhere.” Then a wall with a gate will pop up in front of them. (Once the people of paradise enter through the gate the gate will be closed.) On one side the gate there will be the blessing of Paradise and on the other side the torture of Hell.
They will cry out to the believers: “Were we not with you [in all religious activities]?” The believers will reply:…
… “Yes, but you [never completely submitted to your Lord] accepted temptations, waited to see which direction the wind blows, were always in doubt and were misled by your desires until the God’s Judgment was passed. You were with Satan till the last moment. Consequently, you can not buy your way out on the Day of Judgment, neither can the disbelievers. Hell is the only proper place for the hypocrites and the disbeliever who never took God as their Lord. What an evil destiny.
Is it not yet time for those (who consider themselves the believers) that their hearts should melt when “for God’s sake” is mentioned and be filled with the (spirit of sacrifice for the) truth? Is it not yet time to learn from those to whom God gave the book before you and not behave like them? Do not you realize to what a rock their hearts has turned into and how they have become sinners ? [what an appropriate reminding when you look at their societies today plagued with sex, gambling, drugs, divorces,...]
The same God that gives life to the earth after its death, has sent down His message to give life to your [spiritually] dead society. Think about it.
Those believing men and women who sincerely practice charity have indeed advanced a good loan to their Lord. God will return their loans many folded and there is a generous reward for them in reserve.
Those who have believed in God and His Prophets are the ones who have truthfully believed in truth. As the true witnesses, they will receive their light [the energy which will give them enough power to fly to Heaven] and a great reward (paradise.)
Know that the life in this world is nothing but a play and amusement. You are engaged in a show to compete among yourselves to earn more wealth and children in order to be proud of. The life in this world is like the plants which grow after a shower of rain, making people happy, but soon after they become yellow and turn into useless hay, blown away by the wind. This worldly life is not more than a temporary illusion. The real life starts in Hereafter where there is either a sever punishment for the disbelievers or forgiveness of the Lord accompanied by pleasure for the successful ones
Therefore engage in competition with one another in earning the Paradise which is as spacious as the entire universe [capable of accommodating you all], ready for those who have believed in God and His Messengers. Such is God’s grace [ready to be grabbed by anyone] that He showers whoever He wants with. The grace of Lord has no limit.
Any misfortune that happens to you, physical or non-physical, is [a trail which is] already pre-destined. This is easy for God to do.
This is mentioned so that you do not grief over a loss nor be proud of whatever God has given to you [while you may think that you have earned it yourself]. Indeed God does not like those who are proud and arrogant.
The latter are stingy and prevent the others to be generous in their charitable contribution. No matter you spend money for the sake of God or not, God is the wealthiest indeed and is the Only One worthy of praise.
God sends His Prophets with clear proofs indicating their prophet hood, the book [which contains all the teachings required for the guidance of man] and the criterion without which right or wrong can not be defined. God has also sent down the iron which gives you great strength [to be used by God’s army to enforce His Will] and has many other benefits for man. All this is done so that God may know who helps His cause and His Prophets, on faith. God is strong [and does not need your help], Almighty.
I (God) appointed Noah as a Prophet and Abraham (after him). I chose the Prophets after them from the descendants of Abraham and gave them the Scriptures. Some of their followers were righteous but most of them chose wickedness. 
After them we sent many Prophets [to guide them back to the right path]. Eventually I sent Jesus, son of Mary and gave him the Gospel and placed in the heart of his follower’s kindness and mercy. The Monasticism [abandoning the world out of fear], however, was their own invention (not prescribed by God) to please God. They did not observe the rules of their invented sect in the right spirit as it should have been observed. I (God) rewarded those of them who had believed but most of them are wicked.
O’ you who have chosen to believe, be mindful of your duties towards God and trust His Prophet (Mohammad). God will be twice as merciful to you. God will give you a light [energy] that enables you to walk [toward your destination] and will forgive your wrongdoings [committed due to your human weaknesses in spite of your sincere belief]; God is Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
May the followers of the previous Scriptures know that they do not have the monopoly to God’s mercy and grace and that all grace is in God’s possession which He may shower upon whoever He desires. The Grace of God does not have any limit.
God indeed heard the plea of the woman who brought her case to her Lord during her prayer; God Hears everything and Knows everything.
It is a tradition among you that a man may consider his wife (in anger) as his mother (divorcing her forever!) This is absurd. God forgives this practice of yours in the past as He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
If a man recourse to the above mentioned tradition and then wants to return to his wife should free a slave for his action/intention.
If such a man is not wealthy enough to free a slave, he should fast two consecutive months. If he is not physically fit to do so, he has to feed sixty needy ones. This is to increase your faith in God. The unbelievers who do not obey the laws of your Lord, will certainly deserve His punishment.
Have no doubt that those who resist God and His messenger will be reduced to dust as the disbeliever before them were humiliated accordingly. God has sent down clear signs and there is an awful punishment in reserve for the disbelievers.
The day will come in which God will gather all of them and inform them of what they were doing (even though they forget) while on earth. Know that God watches everything that you do.
Do not you realize that God is aware of everything in the heavens and the earth? whenever a few people whisper secretly together, no matter where they are, God is next to them. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, God will inform them what they have been doing. God is aware of everything.
In spite of the fact that you (Mohammad) forbade them of secret gathering/ whispering, the hypocrites practice their secret meetings and brag about their sins and disobedience of the prophet of God. When they come to you, they greet you in such a way that even God (who loves you so much) has not greeted you. They jokingly say among themselves: “How come God does not punish us for this?” Hell is an enough punishment for them. They will be used as its fuel. What a terrible place to end up in.
O’ you who believe, when you have a private party, do not confess your sins, lack of respect to God’s orders and disobedience of the prophet. Talk about virtue, piety and greatness of God before whom you shall be gathered together in the Day of Judgment.
Secret conspiracy is the work of Satan. He does it to you in order to hurt the believers. But he can not succeed unless God agrees [so that you may go through that test]. A true believer should not worry about the work of Satan and should put his trust in God.
God is hereby asking the believers to make room, out of curtsey, for the new comers in your assemblies to sit; may God open room for you in difficulties. When the meeting is over and you are told to leave, follow accordingly. By doing so you will not loose your rank and dignity as the your rank and knowledge is a grant from your Lord and would not be reduced by being courteous toward the others. Beware that God is aware of your attitude and acts.
Those who believe should engage in an act of charity before any consultation with the Prophet [meaning that Mohammad will not charge you money for talking to you and be happy that you devote the cost of his consultation to a charity]. This purifies you and makes you to feel better. Do not mind, if you cannot afford a charity as God is All-Forgiving and the Most Merciful.
If you fail to pay the above mentioned charity, ask for forgiveness and God will forgive you for that. Remember, however, that the Daily Prayers, the payment of Obligatory Charity and Obedience toward God and His Prophet is a Must for you. Beware that God isaware of what you are doing.
Have you noticed those who befriended people with whom God is angry? They have ended up belonging not to their camp not to yours. They falsely swear of being a true Muslim.
God will punish them severely. Surely what they do is evil.
Their oath of allegiance to Islam is just a cover so that they may turn the Muslims from the path of God. For this they will have a disgraceful punishment.
Neither their wealth nor their children can save them from the punishment of God. They will end up to be the inmates of Fire where they will live in forever.
The Day that they are resurrected, they will swear, as they are swearing to you today, that they are Muslims. They think a simple swearing will save them. Know that they are simply liars.
Satan has dominated them and has possessed them to forget the remembrance of God. They have joined the party of Satan; the member of Satan’s party are real losers.
Know that the lowest of the lowest are those who oppose God and His Prophet.
God has written down:” I and My Prophets will most surely prevail.” God is Almighty, Most Powerful.
You will never find anyone who believes in God and the Day of Judgment befriending those who have opposed God and His Prophet, even if they were their parents, their sons, their brothers or their dearest ones. Such are the people in whose mind God has put faith and has supported them with Divine inspiration. God will admit them to the Gardens underneath which rivers flow and that they live there forever. God is well pleased with them and they are pleased with their Lord. They are God’s party. Know that the member of God’s party are the true successful ones.
Everything in the heavens and earth glorify God for His Power and His Wisdom.
God is the one Who made the disbeliever Jews to leave their house at your first show of force with them. They were thinking that their show of force will bring them the victory; however, God’s force came from where they did not expect and put such a terror in their hearts that they themselves destroyed their own houses. May this event be a lesson for those who possess eyes and see the power of their Lord in action.
If God had not decided to impose the exile on them [in account of His mercy, perhaps due to their monotheistic belief] , He would have certainly punished them in this world as well as casting them in Hellfire of Hereafter.
The whole event took place for the simple reason that the Jews resisted God and His messenger. Know that whoever opposes God will be subject to a sever punishment.
Know that whatever you do such as cutting a palm tree or letting it stand upon its root is by the will of God. God will humiliate His “opponents.”
Any property that God took out from their [the Jewish clan of Bani an-Nadir] possession and gave to His Messenger was not in account of your foot soldiers or cavalrymen war effort. God is behind all forces that He sends against whoever He wills. God has power to do everything He wants.
Any property confiscated from the defeated communities belongs to God and should be distributed in charity by the prophet among the relatives, orphans, needy people and the aliens in need so that they do not end up among rich and strong among you [as is the case of any war]. You may keep whatever the Prophet gives you but do not take anything from the confiscated properties which is not distributed among you. Fear God as He is sever in punishment.
A part of the above property should be given to those poverty stricken Muslims who fled Mecca. They have been expelled from their homes and their properties have been confiscated for the simple reason that they sought the pleasure of God by supporting the cause of their Lord and His messenger. They are the most sincere.
As far as the citizens of Medina, who embraced Islam long ago, is concerned, they helped the immigrants and genuinely love them. They do not mind to see that the immigrants receive the spoils of war at their expense. The fact is those who get rid of their greed are the true successful ones.
Those who embraced Islam later, say: “O Lord forgive us and our brothers in Islam who joined the faith before us. Please do not let any hard feeling to prevail among us; indeed you are kind and Most Merciful.”
Notice how the hypocrites encourage their Jewish “brothers” who, are confronting you, saying: “If you are evicted we will leave with you and if you fight we will fight with you against Mohammad; we will not obey anyone who opposes you.” God knows what type of liars they are.
The fact is that they will never join the Jews in fight and will never follow them after their expulsion. Even if they help your enemies, they will never win.
The fact is that the hypocrites are more afraid of you [a human being] than God. What kind of brain damaged people they are.
It may appear to you that the hypocrites are united. They are in fact divided among themselves. They will never fight with you unless there is a wall between you and them or that they are safe in their castles. They are deprived of the faculty of thinking.
Their fate is the same as the disbelievers before them: total loss. They are going to be punished severely.
The disbelievers are like Satan who invites man to rebel against his Lord…
…. When man tastes the consequence of his rebellion, Satan says: “I have nothing to do with you. As a matter of fact I fear God myself.” They will both end up in Hell to stay there forever; this is the faith of evil doers.
God hereby orders the believers to keep Him always in mind with the utmost respect. Be mindful that whatever (god or bad) that you plant today in this world, you will harvest tomorrow in Hereafter.
Do not be like those who forgot their Lord and God, in return, made them to forget their purpose in life. They are indeed the losers.
Those who will end up in Hell are not equal to those who are going to live in Paradise. The inhabitants of Paradise are the true successful ones.
Had God sent down this Qur’an to the mountain, you would have seen the mountain to crack down itself out of awe. By these types of examples God makes his points to be understood by those who use their brain to think.
God is the only divinity besides Whom none else is divine. He is the only One Who knows everything which is visible to His creatures and everything which is invisible. God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
God is the only divinity besides Whom none else is divine. He is the King, the Most Sacred, the Peace itself, the Most Faithful, the Supreme, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the Most Dignified. Glory to God, it is beneath His dignity to have a partner.
God is the only Divinity. He is the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer and is called by excellent names. Everything in the heavens and the earth is glorifying Him. God is Almighty, the Most Wise.
O’ you who believe, do not extend love and friendship to your Lord’s enemies who are indeed your own enemies. Do not forget that they disbelieved when the truth was presented to them and that they persecute the God’s messenger and you for the simple reason that you believe in your Lord. How can you carry a secret love in your heart toward such people with whom you are ready to fight and to die in order to seek My pleasure and blessings? Do not forget that your God is fully aware of what you say and what you keep as secret in your heart.
Know that the disbelievers are your true enemies. Their main intention is to hurt you physically and verbally. They wish to see you as disbelievers again.
Know that in the Day of Judgment neither your children nor your relatives can be of any help to you as God will Judge you separately. God watches everything that you do.
An excellent example has been set for you by Abraham and his companions. They said plainly to their people: “We have nothing to do with you and the idols that you worship instead of your Creator. We denounce you. There will be nothing between us except animosity and hate; until you believe in Oneness of Lord.” Abraham (out of love for his father) made a mistake and exempted his father saying: “I will pray to Lord to forgive you. However, I have no power to protect you from God, if He does not grant my wish.” Their prayer was: “Our Lord, we put our trust only in You, we ask You and only You for help and we know that one day we will return to You.”
“Our Lord, please do not make us a subject of trial for the disbelievers [in order to give them the chance to choose to persecute us or not in account of our belief]. God Almighty and the Most Wise, please forgive our sins.
Abraham and his companions set a good example of conduct for the one who expect that one Day he will have to present himself before God and that is hopeful that God will help him to succeed his trial. As to those who chose to deny their Lord, let them know that the Most Adorable One is in no need (of them).
May God establish love between you and your idol worshiper relatives with whom you are in animosity (in account of your religious differences). God is capable of making everything to happen; He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
As far as those disbelievers who have not fought with you in account of your religion neither have driven you out of your homes, God does not mind if you deal with them kindly and with justice. God loves just people.
God forbids your friendship only with those disbelievers who fought with you because you were Muslims and drove you out of your homes. Those among believers who take such persecutors as friends are indeed unjust.
The believers hereby ordered to test the women who claim have fled the enemy and ask for asylum. God is fully aware of their faith. If you found that they are true believers, do not extradite them to disbelievers. The newly converted Muslim women are not lawful to remain married to disbelievers. Muslim women may not marry the disbelievers. Therefore, return to their ex-husbands the dowers that they have given to their ex-wives. You are encouraged to ask their hands in marriage having paid a dower to them. The Muslim man should divorce his disbeliever wife after having paid her dower. The disbeliever man also should be asked to return the dower of his exwife who has recently embraced Islam. This is God’s command; He rules among you. He knows everything and is the Most Wise.
Whenever you have a victory over the disbelievers and get some spoils, pay the Muslim man has whatever he has spent on his ex-wife who has betrayed him by joining the enemy’s camp. Keep God in mind when you implement His rules.
O’ Prophet, when the believing women from the enemy side come to seek asylum with you and promises to you that they will not associate anything with God, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill (abort) their children, nor fabricate any falsehood, nor disobey your righteous orders, accept their allegiance and pray to your Lord to forgive them. Surely God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
God hereby orders the believers not to take as friend those with whom God is angry as they are hopelessly stuck in their disbelief. Their case is as hopeless as the case of those disbelievers who are already lying in their graves.
The Almighty and the Most Wise God is being glorified by whatever He has created in the heavens and in the earth.
O’ you who pronounce yourself the believers, how come your actions differ from your words?
Your Lord resents the inconsistency between your words and your actions.
God is pleased with those who fight for His cause as disciplined soldiers who, in line of duty, look like unpenetratable wall.
Do not forget how your Lord turned away from the Israelites as they turned away from Moses when he asked them why they were challenging him knowing (without any doubt) that he is sent to them by their Lord. God indeed does not guide evil people like them and that is why He made their heart so hard.
Your Lord reminds you of Jesus, son of Mary, when he said:” O sons of Israel, I am a messenger sent by God to you, purifying the scriptures of man added phrases and giving you the good news of another messenger of God who will come after me and his name will be Ahmad”. When this messenger came to them with clear proofs and arguments, they simply said:” This is a magic!”
God is asking you:” Who is more sinful that the one who adds a phrase of his own to the scriptures and then claims that such a phrase has been sent down by God?” Your Lord Indeed does not guide such an unjust person who claims to “have submitted himself to the will of his Lord”
The disbelievers will be the most content to see the “Light of God” is being turned off by their words. What they do not realize is that the “Light of God” will keep shining in spit of the fact that the disbelievers resent it.
God is the one who has sent you His messenger to guide you to the right path and to put an end to all existing forged religions even though the disbelievers dislike it.
O’ you who believe, shall I offer you a business deal that will save you from the greatest torture to come?
The deal is: “Believe in your Lord and His messenger and fight for his cause with your money and soul. Know that this is the best advise you will ever get.”
If you do so, God will forgive your sins and will enter you into the gardens of paradise where the rivers flow and dwell you in the most peaceful houses there. This is indeed the biggest achievement of mankind.
Besides, God is going to shower you with his help and wants you to know that the victory is coming soon to you.
O’ you who believe, be “helpers” of God the same way that the disciples of Jesus answered his call saying:” We are the helpers of God.” The Israelites then were divided into two groups; God will give superiority to those Jews who followed Jesus up to the day of Judgment.
Everything in the heavens and earth (knowingly/willingly of unknowingly/ unwillingly) glorify God; the King, the Most Sacred, the Almighty, the Most Wise.
God is the One Who chose a messenger from ordinary people among you to recite for you My revelations and to teach you the scripture while you have been in ignorance for the longest time.
This mission of the messenger is also directed toward those to become Muslims; indeed God is Almighty, the most Wise.
God’s choice of Mohammad to this honor indicates that He may shower whoever he wishes with his Grace as God is the Lord of Mighty Grace.
The Jews [who treated their book like a piece of museum without making it the center of their lives] are not different from a donkey that carries tons of books without knowing what it is loaded with; what a bad example for those who reject My revelations. God indeed will not guide those who are unjust.
Say: “O’ you who have chosen the name of Jews [instead of Muslim (submitted to God) as they were called by their own prophets] for yourselves: if you really believe in your claim that you are the “chosen people”, then pray for death [which is a shortcut to paradise without going through the difficulties of life], if you are sincere in your claim.
They are too in love with this world and aware of their wrong doings to wish for death; God is fully aware of the nature of the wicked ones.
Say: “The death that you are trying to avoid will catch up with you sooner or later; then you have to meet your Lord Who knows everything which is open and secret. He will tell you what you have been doing.”
O’ you have chosen the belief: when you hear the call for the congregational Prayer on Friday, rush to worship your Lord and leave the business for later. This is better for you, only if you knew.
Then when the Prayer is over, spread through the land and ask God to shower you with his blessings and keep God in your mind as much as you can; may you become a true successful one.
Tell to those Muslims who abandoned your Friday sermon to attend a business deal and entertainment: “That what you earn by worshipping God is far superior to what you may gain by closing a business deal or engaging in entertainment activities. Know that God is the best of all providers.”
God bears witness that the hypocrites lie when they come to Mohammad bearing witness that he is the messenger of God. God does not need their confession as the Almighty already knows that Mohammad is His messenger.
They hide their evil intentions under the disguise of Islam. How evil of them to try to turn people away from the path of their Lord.
God has put a seal on their hearts so that they do not understand the truth. They are doomed in account of their denial after having embraced Islam.
When you meet the hypocrites, their appearance pleases you. When you listen to them, however, you detect their true nature which is as worthless of a hollow timber dressed up. They are suspicious of any spoken word and take it personally. They are the enemies of Islam; beware of them as they carry the curse of their Lord.
When people advise them to ask the messenger of God to beg God’s forgiveness for them, they make cutting remarks which indicate their false pride.
They do not care whether you pray for them or not. As a matter of fact, God will never forgive them since your Lord does not guide wicked people.
The hypocrites say: “Do not help the Muslims with your economic resources so that they abandon him.” Do not these hypocrites understand that the whole wealth in the universe belongs to Almighty?
The (among them Ibn Ubayy) say : “As soon as we return back to Medina, the “honorable” ones should evict the “weak” ones from the city. They do not realize that all honor belongs to God, his messenger and the believers.
O’ believers, do not let the love for your children and your worldly wealth distract you from the worship of your Lord. Those who fall into this trap are indeed the losers.
Devote a part of your wealth to the charity. Do not be among those who refrain from charity up to the moment of their death when they beg God to give them a little bit more time so that they devote it to God pleasing purposes.
Know that God knows what you are doing and He will not give any extra time in the moment to the person whose time has come to leave.
God is being glorified by whatever which owes its existence to Him in the heavens and on earth. To Lord belongs the dominion of the existence and He is the only one Who should be worshipped and thanked. God is capable of doing whatever that pleases Him.
God is your Creator. Among you some have chosen to believe in Him and some has chosen to deny Him. God watches over everything man does.
God has not created the heavens and the earth on vain. Your Lord has created you of the best quality. Know that one day you will return to Him.
God has absolute knowledge over what is in the heavens and on earth. Your Lord knows anything that you reveal and whatever you conceal and He is fully aware of any thought that passes into your mind.
Have you not heard of what happened to those people before you who denied their Lord? They were subject to a miserable end; but their misery is not finished yet as a terrible punishment is yet waiting for them.
They were punished in this world and will be punished in Hereafter for the reason that they did not listen to the messenger that God (out of His mercy) sent to them. They were to proud to listen to a man like themselves and their false pride led them to disbelief. God indeed did not “need” their belief. God is the wealthiest (as everything belongs to Him) and He is the only one worthy of worship.
The disbelievers believe that they will not be resurrected. By Lord they will be resurrected and held accountable for what they have done; this is not difficult for God at all.
Therefore, believe in God, His messenger and the light (Qur’an) that I (God) have sent down for your guidance. Have no doubt that God is aware of what you are doing.
The Day that I (God) gather you all together, will be the Day of counting your gains and losses. The one who believed in God and his overall good deeds (during his worldly life) exceeds his wrongdoings, I (God) will cover his sins and make him enter in the gardens that rivers flows in it. He will stay there forever; this is indeed the greatest accomplishment.
On the contrary, those who disbelieved and did not listen to Me (God), they will be the inhabitants of the Fire and have to live in Hell forever; indeed Hell is the worse place to be in.
Know that any hardship that you go through, is permitted by God [directed to some ultimate goal not understood at the moment of affliction]. The One who trust in God, will be directed to the right path. Have confidence that your Lord knows everything that you are going through.
Therefore, follow God and the prophet. If [under the pressure of hardship] you choose the disobedience, know that the only mission of my prophet is to relay my words to you in plain language.
God is the One beside Whom there is no divine power. In God the believers trust.
The believers should realize that their wives and children (who invite them to deviate from the right path for their sake) are their enemies. Beware of them (and do not ruin your eternal life for their sake) but do not treat them harshly. May God, out of his mercy, forgive them and guide them to join you in the right path. Surely God is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
The love toward your wealth and children is only a trial for you. Have faith that God’s final reward worth more than what your are so in love with.
Therefore, keep God in your mind as much as you can. Listen and obey your Lord. Spend your wealth in charity to please God; this is for your own good. Anyone who overcomes his stinginess is truly a successful one.
The one who devotes a part of his wealth to charity, has indeed advanced a loan to his Lord. God is going to return this loan many folded and forgive his wrong doings. God is the Most Appreciative and the Most Patient.
God knows everything; whether it is open or secret. God is Almighty, the Most Wise.
God is hereby ordering his prophet to follow the following rules in divorce: First of all the waiting period (as prescribed in Ch. should be strictly calculated and reinforced as it is a serious matter in the eye of God. Secondly, the husband should not forced his wife to leave the house neither the wife should leave the house unless she has committed an open indecency. These are the laws of your Lord; whoever does not obey the law of God has been unfair to his own soul. God has imposed these laws so that there may be a reunion after the agreement upon divorce has been reached.
When the prescribed time is over, either return to your wife and honor her or depart decently and with kindness. You need two “just” men to witnesses the occurrence of the divorce. God, out of His Mercy, will help the one who believes in God and Hereafter and follows the order of his Lord.
God will provide for the above mentioned person from a source that he least expects it. The one who puts his trust in God, will not be disappointed. God has appointed a fate for everything.
The women who have reached menopause, their waiting period is three lunar months. The same law applies to women who have not menstruated yet or have delayed their menstruation. As for the pregnant women their waiting period ends as they deliver their baby. The one who puts his trust in God, He will make his path easy to pave.
These are the law of God sent down to you; the one who obeys his Lord’s commands, God will cover his sins and increase his reward.
While in their waiting period, let your wives live where you live and support them according to your means and do not harass them so that they would have no choice but to leave. If they are pregnant, you have to support them until they give birth to their child.
If the mother decides to give milk to the baby give her a salary in a mutually fair manner. If you can not reach to an agreement, then hire another woman to suckle the child. Let the rich man spend according to his means and the less fortunate spend as much as he is capable. God is not asking anyone more than what He has given them. May God provide ease after hardship. Now Muslims are being warned of the consequence of their disobedience in this world and Hereafter as well as the reward of their obedience.
There have been many communities who had rebelled against the laws of their Lord relayed to them by God’s Messengers. I (God) dealt with them accordingly and severely punished them.
They suffered in account of their ill-choice. What a loss they chose deliberately.
God has prepared for them a terrible punishment in Hereafter. Therefore, if you have intelligence and have chosen to believe, be mindful of your Lord. Your Lord has sent down to you a message through a messenger who clearly recites to you the revealed words of God in order to lead those who believe and lead an honorable life out of darkness into the light….
… Any one who believes in God and leads an honorable life will end up in the gardens of Paradise wherein the rivers flow. He will live there forever. God has provided for such a person an excellent provision.
God is the One Who created seven universes and many planets similar to earth [inhabited by living species]. Your Lord’s laws govern alike in all His realm of creation. This is let you know that God is the most powerful and that He is fully aware of everything.
O’ Mohammad, why do you declare something lawful as unlawful to you? In order to please your wife? God will forgive you for this as He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
God has already made lawful for you to break your oath of such a kind through expiation as God is your Protector. Indeed God knows everything and is the Most Wise.
[God knows the secrets of everyone]. Once Mohammad revealed a secret to his wife and she informed the others, Mohammad asked his wife why she has not kept the secret! His wife was surprised and asked who has informed him. Mohammad said: “The Lord Who Knows and is aware of everything.”
If you, two wives of Mohammad (Aysha & Hafash), return to God (as you are already inclined to do so) to ask forgiveness from your Lord for “conspiracy” behind your husband, it will be the best for you. If you, on the contrary, back up each other against your husband, then you are against God, angle Gabriel, the righteous believers and the angles who help the messenger of God.
Bear in mind that if Mohammad divorces you, God will put better than you in Mohammad’s path to marry: the virgins or previously married women who are true Muslims, believing, obedient, mindful of God, worshipper of Lord, and observant of fasting.
O’ you who believe, protect yourselves and your families from being cast into Hellfire of such intensity that will turn the stone into a blaze. Know that the Angles appointed as Hell Keepers are stern and will never disobey God’s command in order to show mercy to the guilty ones. …
…They will say: “O you who chose to disbelieve, do not look for an excuse today. You are here in Hell in account of what you were doing.”
O’ you who believe, ask God from the bottom of you heart for forgiveness. May God forgive your sins and let you enter into the gardens of paradise where the rivers flow. Know that, in the Day of judgment, God will not humiliate His Prophet and those who have joined him in belief. Their light will radiate in front of them and to their right. They will say: “O our Lord, forgive us and perfect our light; we bear witness that you are capable of doing anything you wish.”
O’ Mohammad, fight for the sake of pleasing God, with the disbelievers and the hypocrites; be stern with them. Know that their final home is Hell, which is the worse place to be.
God, hereby, gives the disbelievers as an example the life story of the wives of Noah and Lot. They had the honor of being married to two of My righteous servants; but they did not follow their husbands’ way of faith and sided with their enemies against them. Their husbands, naturally, can not help them all against the God. On the Day of Judgment, these women will be told: “Enter the Fire along with those who are condemned to Hellfire.”
As for the believers, God introduces, as an example, the wife of Pharaoh. She prayed: “Lord provide me a building in your Paradise and save me from Pharaoh and the Hellfire which his deeds will take him into. I beg you to save me from the wickedness of the disbelievers.
Another example of believers is Mary, daughter of Amran, who [unlike what the Jews claim] guarded her virginity. Then I (God) placed inside her body a Spirit of Mine. She believed in the words of her Lord and His Books and she was one of the Lord abiding people.
The Most Blessed One is God Who has the dominion of creation in His hand and is capable of doing anything that pleases Him.
God has created the phenomena of death and life in order to see what kind of good deeds man will accomplish. God is Almighty and Forgiving.
God is the One Who has created seven universes one engulfing the other. Observe and observe again to see if you may detect any fault in the dominion of the creation of the Most Gracious.
Continue observation after observation till the result put you in the state of awe about the vastness and the flawlessness of His Dominion.
God has adorned the lowest universe with the sources of light [probably a reference to the Quasars], being used as missiles against the devils [perhaps the reference is to anti-matter which will be destroyed immediately in contact with the matter] and prepared for them a blazing fire.
As far as those who disbelieve in God, they will be subjected to the torture in Hell. Indeed the Hell is the worse place to end up in.
Anytime that the disbelievers are thrown into Hell they will hear its roaring as it boils up.
The Hell Keepers will ask them in rage: “Did not anybody warn you of this moment?”
They will reply: “Yes, indeed a Warner came to us but we mocked at him saying: God has not revealed anything to you; you and your followers are indeed wrong.”
Then they will say with sorrow: “If we had listened, we would not have ended up here in Hell.”
So they will acknowledge their sins, but it will be too late to ask for God’s forgiveness.
Forgiveness, and a great reward, is for those who are mindful of their unseen Lord during their earthly life.
It is alike for God whether you murmur secretly or speak loudly in public. God hears everything. He even knows your secret thoughts.
How is it possible that the Creator does not know his creature? Your Lord knows the finest mysteries and he is the Most Aware.
He is the One Who has made the earth hospitable for you. Roam its corners, find your provision and know that one they you will return to meet your Lord.
It is only in account of God’s mercy that you walk so proudly on earth…
…. without being constantly afraid of a sudden quake, swallowed by earth or destroyed by a twister.
As a warning, I (God) destroyed the disbelievers of the past with terrible natural disasters so that man be grateful for the security that his Lord has provided for him on earth.
Do the disbelievers not see the birds above them who spread their wings and close the? Non but your Merciful Lord is upholding them in the sky. Know that God watches over [not only the birds but over] everything.
Tell Me, is there any army in the universe mightier than God, the Most Gracious, to help you when you are in need? What a pity that the disbelievers simply do not get it.
Tell Me, who is going to feed you, if the Most Merciful decides to cut your provision? What a pity that the disbelievers deny the simple facts.
Tell Me, which one is better, walking upright on a smooth road or putting head down like the cattle and following rest of the herd?
Mohammad, tell them that: “God is the One Who created you at first place and enabled you to see and to hear and to think. What a pity that most of you do not use these faculties as a sign of being grateful to your Creator.
Tell them the Creator is the One Who let you spread all over the world and He is the One Who will gather you from every corner of the earth to face His Justice.
Jokingly they ask: “When will this happen?”
Tell them: “Only God knows when. I do not know the time. My only job is to warn you.”
When the Day of Judgment arrives, their faces will look like the criminals who are being led to the prison. Then they will be said: “This is the time that you were wondering when it will happen.”
Tell them: “Suppose God answered your prayers and destroyed Mohammad and other Muslims, what will it profit you? You should worry about yourselves as to how you will save yourselves from the punishment of God.”
Tell them: “God is the Most Merciful to us for the simple reason that we believe in God and in God we trust.”
Tell them: “If God decides to dry up your source of the water [that you take it for granted], who else beside God you have to turn to restore to you the running springs of water?
N, Hereby God swears by the pen and all writing instruments (including the computer keyboards nowadays) that:
You (Mohammad), by grace of Lord, are not (as your enemies refer to you) crazy.
As a matter of fact, there is a never ending reward for you with your Lord (in account of the sufferings you are going through…
… in guiding people to the right path) and you are already elevated to a high and noble rank.
Pretty soon you and them will see…
… who is really crazy.
Indeed your Lord knows who is walking on the right path and who is lost.
Knowing that your Lord has shown you the right path, never follow those who have rejected it.
They wish you compromise, so that they may compromise too.
And do not give in to a person who…
… knows nobody believes him, therefore he swears every time that he mentions something….
… He is a slandered, back biter, forbidder of good, transgressor, sinner, Ignoble and,…
… above all, a low life at birth.
Just because he has wealth and children,
Anytime that his Lord’s revelations is recited to him, he says: “These are nothing but ancient time’s mythologies.”
“ Pretty soon I (God) will brand him with disgrace.
These people are tried the same way that your Lord tried the owners of the most fruitful gardens who said: “Tomorrow is the that that we will gather the fruits of our garden.”
And they forgot to say: “God willing.”
While they were sleeping your Lord send a storm which destroyed their garden.
In the morning all was destroyed.
As they woke up they said:…
… “Let us go gather our fruits.”
On their way they decided not to let any poor person to enter to their…
… garden asking for charity.
They were sure of their harvest.
As soon as they saw their destroyed garden they said: “Are we in right place.”
We have lost everything.
The more just one said: “We forgot to worship/ thank the Lord.”
Then they said: “Glory to our Lord, we were wrong.”
Then they started to blame each other.
They said: Shame and pity on us as we sinned.”
“We repent. May our Lord, out of his Mercy, give us even a better garden.”
Such was their punishment. They did not know, however, that the punishment of the Hereafter is far greater.
As far as those who follow their Lord’s path, they will surely end up in the gardens of Paradise.
After all, do you expect your Lord to treat the one who obeys the same way that He treats the guilty one?
What is wrong with you? What kind of logic is that the sinner and the obedient should be treated equally?
In which book did you read that …
…you will choose whatever you want there in Hereafter?
Do you have any covenant with your Lord that your freedom of choice is granted to you forever?
Ask them O’ Mohammad, who has guaranteed that their wishful thinking will come true.
Which one among those whom you worship beside your Lord (idol, woman, children, boss, money, etc.) will help you in the Day of Judgment?
The Day surely will come when their deeds will publicly be displayed. They will ask to prostrate but they will be so overcome that they can not even fall down.
Their eyes full of shame and sorrow they will be reminded of the time that they had the opportunity to fall down in prostration and worship their Lord but they refused to.
So Mohammad, never mind those who reject My word and leave them to Me. They will be overtaken in such a way that they cannot even realize that they are being ruined.
I (God) will give them enough time so that they completely prove that they are guilty; My plan is indeed perfect.
Mohammad, are you asking a reward for inviting them to the right path that they feel so enraged toward you?
Mohammad, do they have any knowledge of unseen that they accuse you of being a fraud.
Mohammad be patient with them as the time of your final victory over them is yet far off and do not behave impatiently as did Jonah, who, in account of his impatience, was swallow by the big fish.
If your Lord had not been graceful to him, his dead body would have been thrown out on the naked shore on disgrace.
But your Lord forgave him and included him among the righteous people.
Mohammad, when the disbeliever hear the verses of Qur’an, they look at you in such a way as though their eyes want to eat you up and say: “Mohammad is certainly mad.”
Know that this Qur’an is nothing but a reminder sent by God to all intelligent creatures of the worlds.
The truth.
The undeniable truth.
The day of Judgment will truly take place.
The people of Thamood and A’ad before you thought the Day of Judgment is a lie.
The Thamoodians tasted the punishment of God while overtaken by a terrible storm of thunder and lightening.
As to the people of A’ad, God destroyed them with a furious roaring wind in account of their disbelief…
… Those who were refusing to bow down at their Lord were prostrating by the force of the wind which threw them down as if they were the trunks of hollow palm trees.
Do you see any of them around?
As well as Pharaoh, the tyrants before him and the cities who were engaged in nothing but sins [the reference may be to Sodom and Gomorrah].
[God sent them a messenger to offer them a decent code of conduct]. As they denied the messenger of God, your Lord punished them badly.
Remember the favor of your Lord Who carried you on the Arc (of Noah) as the water rose high as a reminder. …
…May the ears that appreciate the truth retain it as a remembrance.
The time will come when the Trumpet is being blown with a single blast.
On that day the earth will be thrown out of its projectile and the mountains will be pulverized to powder.
It will be the time for the inevitable to happen.
The Day on which the [ozone layer of the] sky will crack and the cosmos will loose its order.
Man then will be at awe with the presence of His Lord accompanied by eight most honorable angles; a Solomon occasion like a King ascending on His Throne.
On that Day man’s most secret affairs will be replayed to him in front of his Lord.
The one who receives his lifetime’s report card in his right hand will joyfully show it to everyone with pride and will say:..
.. “Read my lifetime devotion to God, I knew that one day I will be proud of it.”
He will be the happiest ever in the best of gardens…
where the fruits are so close that…
… it requires only extending the hand to pick up.
He will be said: “Enjoy eating and drinking which is a reward for your devotion.”
As to the one who will be given his sentence to the left hand, he will moan: “I wish I would have never done all those wrong things.”
“I wish I would have never been reminded of my deeds.”
“I whish my death would have been the end of my existence.”
“Today the wealth that I accumulated during my lifetime is of no help to me.”
“My power and reasoning are useless now.”
It will be ordered: ..
..“Take the guilty one, put the chain on his neck and throw him into the blazing fire..
... [Once he is reborn], fasten him with a chain which is seventy cubits long.”
For he did not believe in Almighty Lord.
No only he did not feed an orphan but he did not even appreciate such a charitable act [probably calling them lazy, of bad nature, shame to the society, better dead than alive, etc.]
No wonder he does not have any friend here today.
No wonder his food today is nothing but left over water of washing of wounds.
Yes that is what the sinners eat: leftover liquid of washing the wounds.
I (God) swear by whatever you see.
I (God) swear by whatever you do not see.
These are my words relayed to you by my honorable messenger.
These are not the words of a poet (how stubborn of you not to refer to your own conscious to find the truth.)
These are not the words of a person who claims to know the future (how little you reflect to see the depth of these revelations.)
This Qur’an is the revelation of the Creator of the worlds to mankind.
Know that if Mohammad had told something of his own and ascribe it to God,…
… I (God) would have indeed seized him by his right hand…
…. and cut off his throat.
None of you could have prevented Me (God) of doing so.
This Qur’an is a message for those who want to stay on the right path.
I (God) know that some of you deny the authenticity of Qur’an.
What a pity for those who do not believe in divine origin of Qur’an.
SURELY THIS IS ABSOLUTE TRUTH.
Therefore, glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High.
Someone asked about the punishment in Hereafter.
Which will be imposed upon the disbelievers whom no one can save from.
By God, the Lord of ascending stairways.
Whenever the Angles and the Spirit ascend to God, it takes only a day for them while during this one day 50,years is passed by in earth.
Mohammad be the most patient.
From the disbelievers point of view it will take forever for them to be subject to the Hereafter’s punishment.
From God’s point of view, however, their punishment is much closer than what they perceive.
When the end comes, the sky will look like melted copper.
And the mountains will be pulverized to look like the flakes of wool.
The event will be so awesome that no one will care about his body.
Although the eyes will see each other….
… the fear will be so overpowering that the guilty one will not mind to offer his own beloved children…
…, wife, brother, those who kindly sheltered him and…
…. whatever is in the earth to save his neck.
But no offer will save the guilty one from Hellfire…
… which is eager to roast the one who turned away….
….. and fled from the truth and…
…. did nothing but making and saving money.
One of the man’s deficiency that he has to work upon is his impatience.
When man experiences hardship, he becomes depressed…
and when God makes the man wealthy [instead of showing his gratefulness by becoming generous], he becomes stingy!
Except those who always worship God and…
devote a portion of their wealth to those who ask for financial help and…
… those who…
… are needy.
These generous people are the ones who….
believe in the Day of Judgment and…
… do not want to be convicted by their Lord.
The patient ones are those who do not engage in sexual activities except…
… with their wives and the ones that God has approved for them.
Those who look for sex outside what God has permitted them are indeed sinners.
The patient ones are the one who respect their words,…
… are trustworthy and truthful in their testimony.
Those who have overcome their impatient nature are the one who regularly worship God and….
…. will live in the gardens of Paradise with honor.
O’ Mohammad what is wrong with these disbelievers who…
… rush in toward you from every side to mock at you?
How can they even think about being admitted to paradise?
Indeed they dream on; they themselves know their true nature.
Your Lord solemnly swears that as He is able to make the stars to rise and to die,…
…. He is able to replace them by better creatures.
Be patient with them and you will witness the Day that your Lord has promised.
The Day that they will come out of their grave in such a hurry as though they are in a race to be the first to reach the shrine of their gods.
But instead of their gods they will meet their Lord and their eyes will be downcast of shame when they realize that the Day of Judgment is a reality as they were promised.
God sent Noah to his people in order to warn them of a punishment which awaits them, if they persist their wickedness.
Noah said: “My people, God has sent me to plainly relay His message to you.”
God has asked you to worship Him and to follow me.
By doing so God will forgive some of your sins and will give you enough time to redeem your soul. Know that when the day comes, God will not postpone it.
After repeating and repeating the message uselessly, Noah begged: “O My Lord, I take you as a witness that I have relayed your message days and nights.”
But my calls have made them more and more daring and challenging.
Anytime that I have given them the good news of your promises to forgive them, they put their fingers into their ears, cover themselves with their cloths and arrogantly avoid me.
I have delivered your message publicly;..
… I have talked to them openly and privately with no result.
I urged them to seek forgiveness in Lord, the Most Forgiving.
I brought to their attention that if they do so,…
… God will shower them with blessings: abundant rain from the sky, wealth and children, fruitful gardens and continuous flowing rivers.
What is the matter with you that you do not fear your Creator?
The One Who brought you to the present stage after passing you through different stages of creation and phases of development.
Why do not you recognize the awesome power of God Who has created seven universes one engulfing the other.
How do you dare to rebel against the One who created the sun which sends out the light and the moon which reflects the light.
God is the One Who made you grow like the plants out of the earth in an amazing manner.
Then He will return you to the earth and one day resurrect you out of it.
God is the One Who has spread out the earth for you…
…so that you may use its wide paths for your transportation.
Noah said: “My Lord, instead of following me, my people have followed their chiefs. They are enchanted with their chiefs’ wealth and children which, not only will not benefit them but also, will be used as a source of oppression against them.”
Their chiefs have already devised a vicious plan against them.
Their chiefs have told them not to abandon their idols: Wadd, Suwa, Yaghuth, Yauq and Nasr.
Their chiefs have misled many. My Lord, I beg you deprive them of your blessings and do not give them nothing but misery.
In account of their sins God drowned them and they will be cast into Hellfire where they will find no saver but their Lord.
Then Noah prayed: “O my Lord, may you not leave any disbeliever on earth…
…. If disbelievers stay on earth, they will do no good but misleading your servants and will pass their wicked genes to their offspring.
My Lord, forgive me and my parents and those men and women who have joined me in worshipping you and may you do not give anything to disbelievers except misery.
O’ Mohammad, declare that: “God has informed me that in an occasion a group of Jinns have listened to the recital of the Qur’an and have found it amazing.”
“The Jinns have, therefore, arrived to the conclusion that Qur’an guides man and Jinns to the straight path and that they have decided not to worship but God.”
“The Jinns, therefore, bear witness the majesty of the Lord and that He has not taken anyone as His wife or child.”
“The Jinns hereby declare that they are ashamed of those jinns who have chosen to worship others beside their Creator.”
“The Jinns admit that it is a sin for a Jinn or a man to fabricate a lie against God.”
“The Jinns declare that throughout the history there has been instances when men have co-operated with the Jinns of evil nature; this co-operation, however, has not been beneficial for men as they became more wicked.”
“Those wicked (jinns/ men) were thinking, as you think, that God will never raise anyone [raise as a prophet or raise in the day of judgment].”
“We ventured into inter galactic travels but found the space full of dangerous meteors.”
“And we were used to seat in some places in the space, monitoring intergalactic bands of noises/voices. But those places now are in the projectile of dangerous meteors.”
“We do not know whether man’s misfortune in earth is a punishment or God intends to impose hardship upon them so that they become mature and experienced.”
“Among us there are righteous Jinns and wicked ones; we are following different ideologies.”
“We know well that on earth or in the space we can not escape God.”
“As soon as we heard the word of God, we submitted to it. Any one who believes in God will never fear any loss or injustice imposed upon him.”
“Some of us are Muslims (submitted to the will of God) and some of us are unjust. Those who have submitted themselves to the will of God,…
… they are on the right path. Those who have compromised, they will be used as a firewood for Hell.”
O’ Mohammad, say: “If people sincerely follow the right path, their Lord will send them abundant water” [which is the source of life].
And the one who does not talk to his Lord in humility (worship), his Lord will severely punish him.
Know that the mosques are only for the remembrance of God. Do not praise anyone in the mosque except God.
What a disgusting scene it was when a servant of God stood in the mosque to worship his Lord, the ignorant crowd stifled him almost to death.
O’ Mohammad, say: “I only worship God and do not associate any one with Him.”
Say: “I am not given the power to inflict any evil on you, neither I am given the authority to guide you.”
Say: “None can protect me from God, nor can I find refuge in anyone but God.”
Say: “My mission is only to relay God’s message. Whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, he will have the Fire of Hell to live in forever.
It is only when they see the Hellfire with their own eyes that they will realize your few helpers are not as weak as they thought and that their numerous supporters are weak indeed.
Say: “I do not know the Hellfire that God has promised you is going to happen soon to you or that there will be a long time before you face it.”
God is the only one who knows the unseen. He is not going to reveal His secrets to anyone.
If God decides to reveal a part of His knowledge to mankind,..
… He will choose messengers among themselves and put guards around them to know whether or not they have delivered the message. God is fully aware of his messengers’ activities and keeps a count of each and every thing.
O’ (Mohammad) who are slipped into something comfortable at home and relax.
Rise to worship your Lord at night;…. half of the night, a little bit more or a little bit less….
… and recite as much as Qur’an which is so far revealed to you…
…. in a low voice.
Pretty soon you will be given the rest of Qur’an: a mighty revelation [for mankind].
Surely the night time is the best time for worship…
… as you are tied up during day with daily worldly affairs.
Call upon your Lord by calling His name and devote yourself completely to Him.
God is Lord of the east [from Mecca to China and the horizon beyond] and Lord of the west [from Mecca to America and above its horizon] ; there is no God beside Him. Therefore choose Him as your Protector.
And be patient with your enemies and leave them with dignity.
And let me deal with those who reject my words (Qur’an). They have been showered with my blessings so far; be patience with them for a while.
The fait of those who reject is chains around their neck & feet and blazing fire (in which they will be thrown.)
They will be given the worst kind of food that they can hardly swallow and a painful punishment is waiting for them.
Pretty soon a day will come when the earth and the mountains will shake so violently that the mountains will transfer into scattered sand
[Beware mankind] I (God) have sent you a messenger to witness against you [on the day of judgment] just as I sent a messenger (Moses) to Pharaoh
[What a shame that] Pharaoh disobeyed My messenger; so He was subjected to the most sever punishment.
If you persist in your denial, how can you face a day that its bitterness changes the hair color of the children into white?
The day on which the sky will open up into pieces; God’s promises will surely be fulfilled.
This is a reminder. One has freedom to choose it or to reject it.
God knows how much you and your followers pray at night: two third of it, half of it or one third of it. God is aware of man’s weakness; consequently, He has pardoned you [not to fulfill his ordered as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter]. Therefore, recite as much (of the Qur’an) as you can. God is aware that some of you may be sick, some of you may be traveling and some of you striving for the cause of your Lord. Therefore, recite as much as you can; but keep up with your daily prayer and give the least charity tax which is imposed upon you by God. In addition, contribute as much as you can to charity and consider it as a loan to God. Whatever you spend on charity is like being sent a provision for Hereafter kept (and multiplied) for you by God. And beg God for forgiveness as He is the most Forgiving, the most Merciful.
O’ you who are wrapped up in the blanket.
Get out of bed and start you mission of warning the people.
And Glorify your Lord.
And worship your Lord with a clean garment.
And avoid idol worshipping.
Worship your Lord for the sake of glorifying Him; and out of love and not just in account of expecting things in return. Your worshipping is not a favor that you do for God.
And seek patience in your Lord.
The Day that the horn is blown.
That will be a very somber day.
A hard Day for the disbelievers.
My creature will meet his Creator alone.
The same creature that I provided him with so much resources.
The same creature that I gave him sons to be by his side.
The same creature that I made the life easy for him to prosper.
Yet he dares to ask for more.
No way; he is the one who refuses to listen to my words.
Pretty soon he has to face me so that I sentence him to a terrible punishment.
He is the same person who listened to My revelations and then came up with a plan to make fun of it.
Shame on such a person with his miserable plan.
Shame and disgrace.
Being upset about his failure, he looked around.
Then he frowned and winkled to show his displeasure.
Then arrogantly he turned away.
and said: “These words are nothing but usual magic”.
Then he said: “These words are not from the Lord; they are fabricated by a human being”.
Pretty soon I will cast such a person into Hellfire.
Do you have the least idea what Hellfire is?
The Hellfire will not spare any disbeliever.
The Hellfire will burn every cell of the disbeliever.
Over it are nineteen.
I (God) have appointed some angles to be the guardians of Hell and I (God) have made their numbers (19): as a trial for those who disbelieve, to convince the Christians and Jews about the authenticity/ divine source of this book, to increase the faith of those who already believe, to remove any doubt from the heart of the Christians, Jews and the believers, to expose those who are sick at heart and can not be guided, and the disbelievers mocking at these words say: “What could God mean by this strange presentation?” Thus God leaves those who deserve to be left in ignorance in ignorance and guides whoever He pleases to the right path and no one but Lord knows the magnitude of His power. Hell is mentioned her so that people may be more careful and mindful about their behaviors.
I (God) swear by the moon.
And by the night that passes by.
And the day that takes over.
That Hell too is a somber reality.
The very existence of Hell is a warning to mankind.
To anyone among you who wishes to advance himself or stay behind.
Every soul will be held responsible for his acts.
As to the righteous people, while in Paradise,…
…. they will ask the sinners…
…: “What brought you to Hell?
The sinners will reply:
“We did not worship the Lord.”
“We did not feed the poor people”
“We joined those who were mocking at religion.”
“We joked about the Day of Judgment.”
“Till we faced the Day of Judgment.”
God will not accept any intercession for such sinners.
What is wrong with these people…
… who are running away from our admonitions…
… as though they were zebras running from the lion?
Do they expect a personalized letter of invitation for each of them?
The fact is that they are careless about Hereafter.
Indeed this Qur’an is a reminder.
Let those who wish understand it.
Only those who deserve the blessing of God will believe in it. In God alone you will find righteousness and in God alone you will find forgiveness.
I (God) swear that Resurrection will surely take place.
And I (God) swear that in that day each soul will self accuse itself.
Do disbelievers think that God is not capable of assembling back their bones?
Yes, God is capable of reproducing every man in detail giving them the same finger print that would distinguish them from each other.
The reason for which man is denying Resurrection is because he wants to continue living in sin and does not like the idea of being held accountable for his actions.
That is why the disbeliever jokingly ask when will Resurrection take place.
Resurrection will take place when a dazing light overtakes the sights.
And the moon becomes dark
And the sun will explode and engulf the moon.
In that day man will seek for a refuge.
But there shall be no refuge.
There will be only one place to take refuge in: in your Lord.
On that day man will be informed of what good or bad he did (or did not) during his worldly life, how his actions affected the others at his time as well as the generations to come and what opportunities he missed.
Man knows who he is and what he has done.
Even though he may bring many excuses to justify his behavior.
O’ Mohammad, be patient in reciting and putting this Qur’an together.
I (God) am the only one to put this Qur’an together and its recitation is to please Me.
Whenever the verses of Qur’an is recited, follow its orders.
It is only God Who will explain Qur’an to you.
The fact is that you love this life so much…
… that you forget about Hereafter.
On that day some faces will glow.
Looking toward their Lord.
While other faces will be sad.
Knowing that a back breaking calamity is waiting for them.
In the moment of death, when the soul comes up to the throat.
Man will hear a voice: “Which magician can return this soul back to the body?”
Then man knows that it is time to leave.
Then each leg will stay motionless to the next leg.
That will be the Day to depart to your Lord.
Man who never worshipped the Lord nor participated in any charity.
Man who chose to disbelieve and turned back
Man who returned arrogantly back to his folks joking.
Shame to such a man who deserves what he is going to receive.
Indeed such a man deserves his miserable destiny.
Does man think that he will be given his freedom of choice forever?
Does man not remember what an insignificant seed in a drop of semen he was?
Then his Creator made him a leech like clot.
And then God determined the sex of the unborn baby.
Is not the same Creator able to bring the dead.
Does man not recognize a stage of his life in which he was practically nothing worth to mention?
Your Creator created you from a tiny embryo and then gave you the faculties of sight and hearing in order for you to go through the school of life.
God has showered mankind indiscriminately with His favor, by showing the right path; no matter how grateful or ungrateful man is.
As to the ungrateful ones, God has prepared for them iron chains, iron collars and a blazing Fire.
The grateful one, on the other hand, will fill their cup from a tasteful drink of a spring in Paradise known as Kafour.
The spring from which the believers will drink will never dry up.
The believers are those who fulfill their vows and are afraid of the day that its terror will reach the guilty one as far as he is.
The true believers are those who prefer to stay hungry and give their food to the needy, the orphan and the captive.
They will say: “We feed you just to please our Lord and do not ask anything in return from you.”
Indeed we are afraid of the stern and distressful day of judgment.
God has already saved them from the evil of that day and they will be happy with joyful faces.
And God rewards them, for their patience in hardship, with garments made of silk in gardens of Paradise.
Wherein they relax and not suffer neither the hot days under the sun nor the cold nights under the moon.
They enjoy the shadow of the trees whose fruits are easily accessible to them.
They are served drinks in silver cups and crystal goblets.
Their silver made transparent cups are filled as much as they wish.
They enjoy drinks of delicious flavors from…
… a spring therein known as “Salsabil.”
Their servers are ageless youth who resemble to scattered pearls in beauty.
When you look around, you will see blessing all over; a magnificent dominion.
Wearing fin green silk garments with gold embroidery and carrying silver bracelets, they will be admitted to the receptions wherein God will offer them pure drinks.
This is the way that God appreciates your efforts meant to please Him.
I (God) have revealed to you this Qur’an as a special favor.
Patiently carry out your Lord’s commandments and do not accept any disbelievers’ invitation to sin.
And glorify the name of your Lord day and night.
When the night comes, worship God by bowing down and prostrating before Him; adore and glorify your Lord for the longest time.
People are so preoccupied with this transitory life that they forget about the somber Day of Judgment which awaits them.
I (God) have created them and I have given them the authority; anytime that I wish, I may replace them with another kind of creature.
This is a reminder; you are free to choose the path which leads to your Lord.
Your goal will be accomplished, if it coincides with the will of God, the Most Knowledgeable, the Most Wise.
God shows mercy to whoever He wants. As for evil-doers, God has prepared an awful punishment.
I (God) swear by the same winds that are sent as an emissary for the profit of mankind.
I (God) swear by the raging hurricanes that…
…t scatter clouds to their final destinations.
I (God) swear by the verses of Qur’an which separate right from the wrong.
I (God) swear by the angles which bring down the verses of Qur’an one after another to…
…. warn and leave no room for any excuse.
That indeed what Mohammad has told you will come true.
When the stars become dark.
When the [ozone layer of the] sky is cracked.
When the mountains are reduced to dust.
And when the messengers are gathered at the appointed time.
Then that day will be the Day of Judgment.
The day of the decision.
What a somber day it will be.
Pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
Remember how I (God) destroyed the former generation of disbelievers;…
…. replacing them with other generations.
This is the way that I (God) deal with the guilty ones.
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
Did I (God) not create you from a disgusting liquid?
Then place that tiny embryo in a safe resting place?
For a known period of time?
Then designed it to the best of the proportion?
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
Have I (God) not made the earth’s components to gravitate to each other?
And made it a home for the living and the dead?
And raised on the earth high mountains and provided you with sweet water which is essential for you to life?
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
Now go to Hell; the same Hell that you did not believe in its existence.
Go live under the cloud of three poisonous gases which forms its atmosphere.
The clouds which do not provide any coolness nor protect you from the heat.
Live in Hell and see how it throws sparks as high as mansions.
which are as yellow as the color of the camels.
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
On the Day of Judgment, the disbelievers will loose their ability to talk.
Nor will be they given the opportunity to apologize.
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
This is the Day of Judgment, I (God) have summoned you and the generations before you.
If you know of any trick, go ahead and use it against me (God.)
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
The righteous ones, on the other hand, will enjoy pleasant shades and springs.
They will be offered any fruit that they desire.
Enjoy eating and drinking . This is the reward of your good deeds.
This is the way that I (God) reward my righteous servants.
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
O’ disbelievers enjoy eating and drinking for a few days of your life.
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
Who did not obey their Lord and did not bow down to Him as a sign of respect and worship.
Sorrow and pity on that day to the rejecters of the truth.
Which message other than the one in Qur’an will they believe in?
Are they questioning and…
… disputing the happening of..
… the great event?
Pretty soon they will find out.
Without any doubt they will find out themselves that Resurrection and Hereafter is true.
The same God which made the earth habitable.
And stabilized the mountains
And created male and female to keep each one company
And favored you with the sleep so that you rest
And made the night a cover
And energized you in the day so that you for after your provision
And built universe upon universe above you
And created the sun as a source of light and energy for you
And sent down water for you from the sky above
To produce plants and grains
And various orchards
The same Mighty Lord Who did all the above has appointed a day of judgment.
The day on which the horn is blown, you all will come forth in crowds.
And the sky will be opened the same way that the gates of a place is being opened.
And the mountains will be erased from the face of the earth as if they were a mirage.
The Hell then will be waiting impatiently.
To house the rebels.
So that they live there for ages to come.
They will never taste any drink or coolness there.
The only thing that they will taste is a boiling drink and a dark murky extremely cold fluid.
This is a proportional reward for what they did on earth.
They never minded the day of judgment.
And treated their Lord’s revelations as a lie and false statements.
Know that every action of mankind is registered in a book.
So let them taste the fruit of your actions as I (God) will not give you anything but the torture.
For the righteous one, on the contrary, the day of judgment is the day of achievement.
Theirs will be gardens and vineyards.
And the most appealing women of their ages.
And a full cup of delicious drinks.
They will never hear any profanity or lies therein.
This is a reward from your Lord: A payment in kind for your good deeds.
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between; the Most Forgiving. No one will dare to argue with Him.
In the Day of Judgment, the Spirit and the angles will stand motionless in a row. No one will dare to say anything without the Most Merciful permission and the only thing which will be spoken is the truth.
The Day of Judgment is a fact; therefore, whoever wishes may choose to seek refuge in his Lord.
I (God) have sufficiently warned you of this upcoming day of punishment. The Day of Judgment is the day that everyone will see what his two hands’ deeds have prepared for such a day. On that day the disbelievers will say: “Oh, I wish I were nothing but dust.”
God, hereby, swears by those angles that are in charge of violently taking the souls of the disbelievers in the moment of their death.
As well as those angles who gently and joyfully take the soul of believers away.
And by those who float in inter-galactic spaces.
Engaged in a friendly race among themselves.
And those who carry out different orders of their Lord.
That one day the whole universe will be subject to a big quake.
Followed by an after shake.
On that day the palpitation of the hearts will be the highest ever due to the fear.
And the eyes will be downcast.
t that time the disbelievers will say: “Now we believe being called back from our graves is a truth.”
“Who would ever thought that our rotten bones will be re-created again?”
These are those who used to mock at the idea of Resurrection.
Know that all that would take for God to resurrect the dead is a snap.
And then they are recreated as they were created at first place.
Have you ever heard the story of Moses?
His Lord called upon him in the sacred valley of Tuwa saying:…
… “Go to Pharaoh; indeed he has rebelled against God by his behavior.”
“Ask him if he has the least desire to purify himself and return to the right path.”
“If so, I will guide you to your Lord Whom…
…. you will be at awe with His Might.”
But Pharaoh did not take advantage of God’s mercy; he rejected Moses’ invitation in disobedience.
Then he went back in hurry, …
…assembled his men and said:…
… “I am your lord, the most high.”
Therefore, God punished him in this world and he will be punished in Hereafter.
Indeed there is a lesson to be learnt in this story for those who are at awe with the Lord’s Power.
Just think for a while. Are you more difficult to create than the universe that God has created?
See how high and proportionate your Creator has put a canopy around the earth [reference to the ozone layer].
And observe the light of the day that follows the darkness of the night.
Look at the earth which He has spread.
See the water which is being re-cycled on earth creating pastures.
And the mountains which are firmly established on earth.
God has created all these for you and your cattle.
Now be mindful of the day that the great disaster that has to come.
The day that man will think about what he has provided for Hereafter.
This will be the day that Hellfire will be shown to man.
And those who rebelled against their Lord’s order,….
and preferred this worldly life,…
will be cast into Hell which will be their home.
As for him who minds to face his Lord and,…
… in consequence, shies away from low worldly desires; he will be housed in the gardens of Heaven.
O’ Mohammad, they will ask you about when the dooms…
… day that you are talking about will take place.
Only your Lord has knowledge about it.
You Mohammad, your task is only to warn the one who minds.
When the dooms day take place, man will think that it was only a few hours ago that he was enjoying his daily life on earth.
Mohammad frowned and turned away.
When the blind man came to him.
How would you know that by attending to him and answering his questions he would not turn into a …
…righteous person and what was your criterion to ignore him?
As to the rich one that you….
gave your preference in discussion, there is no blame on you,…
if he does not choose the right way.
You ignored the one who….
came eagerly to you…
the who is mindful of his Lord.
This is an admonition for…
… the one who accept it gladly.
This admonition is…
hereby presented in this…
honorable and…
glorified book presented…through righteous angles.
How pity of the ungrateful man.
Does this proud creature not think what his Lord created him from?
What is he proud of? He is being created of a tiny sperm [that thousands of them hardly fill the top of a needle!]
To such an insignificance creature God has favored the growth.
Then God takes his soul and put him in the grave.
The same One Who created him out of nothing may resurrect him anytime pleases Him.
What a pity that man has not fulfilled what his Lord has commanded him.
Let man look at his very food that sustains his life [it does not grow up in the super market].
God pour downs lots of water from…
the sky, then He splits the earth and….
makes the corn to grow.
And grapes and nutritious plants.
And olives and dates.
And dense gardens.
And fruits and herbs.
As a provision for man and his cattle [which provides meat for man].
Know that when the big blow is ordered to take over the universe.
Man will leave his brother.
And his mother and his father.
And his wife and his children.
Each individual has enough of his own to be concerned with that does not care about the others.
Some faces in that day will be bright,…
… laughing and rejoicing.
Other faces on that day will be…
.. covered with misery, overwhelmed with sadness.
Such will be the end of wicked disbelievers.
When the sun in folded up (internally collapsed).
When the stars darken.
When the mountains are pulverized.
When the camels [which Arabs take so good care of it] is abandoned.
When the wild beasts run together aimlessly out of fear.
When the seas boil [due to the intense heat created by the explosion of sun].
When the souls are gathered together.
When the little born girl [who was buried because of her sex] will ask for…
what crime she was buried alive.
When the scrolls are laid open.
When the sky’s cover [ozone layer] is unveiled.
When the Hell’s fire start to soar up.
When the Heaven is brought near sight.
Then each soul will realize what it has prepared for Hereafter.
I (God) swear by the stars.
that run their courses.
And the night as it disappears.
And the breath of the dawn.
That Mohammad is truly an honorable messenger of mine.
Established with might by the Lord of the dominion.
To be obeyed and trustworthy.
Know that this fellow among you is not mad.
Truly he has seen himself in a clear horizon.
And that he is not hiding any knowledge of him of unseen.
This Qur’an is not the word of the cursed Satan.
If you turn away from this teaching, where else you can find guidance?
Qur’an is a message to all the worlds.
To the one who wishes to walk on the right path.
Do not forget that your wish will not come true unless it coincides the wished of God.
The day that the sky splits open.
And the stars disappear from the sight.
And the oceans explode and throw their water over the earth.
And when the graves open up.
Then every soul will find out what provision it has sent for life Hereafter and what opportunities for the salvation it has left behind.
O’ mankind, what has made you careless in obeying you Lord, the Most Gracious One?
The Lord Who created you, then designed your different kind of bodies, then completed you the way you are.
In any shape and size that He has wished you to be.
What a shame that you reject His prescribed way of conduct.
But in spite of your ungratefulness, He has put guardians around you!
These honorable beings record all your deeds.
They know what you do.
Once they give the man’s report card, the righteous ones will be pleased as they enter to the gardens of Heaven.
and the wicked ones will be condemned to Hellfire.
where they will be thrown in the Day of Judgment.
And they can not escape from it.
No word can explain how awesome the Day of Judgment is.
Indeed it will be the most awesome.
On that day no soul can help another one and God will be the only one who will decide with absolute authority.
Shame to the cheaters.
The ones who insist to get their money’s worth but when it comes to them,…
… they cheat their customers by selling them less than full measure.
Do they not think that they will be called back to answer their deeds?
That will be a mighty day when…
… all mankind will stand before the Creator of the worlds.
On that somber day the deeds of the wicked ones will be presented in a recorder known as Sijjin.
You may ask what Sijjin is.
A register in which all actions of man is completely registered (a horror story.)
How miserable will be those who deny that day.
Those who deny the day of judgment.
No one denies the Day of Judgment except the one who is the most sinful.
When the verses of Qur’an is recited to such a person he will jokingly say these are nothing but the mythical stories of the past.
Their sins have stained their heart so badly that they can not accept the reality.
What a pity that they will be deprived of their Lord’s Mercy on the Day of Judgment.
And be cast into the blazing Hellfire.
Then they will be told: “This is the Fire that you used to joke about it.”
As to the righteous ones, their deed will be presented in “Elliyin”.
You may ask what “Elliyin” is.
It is a register of the deeds of the righteous ones (happy ending story)
Which is witnessed by those who are closed to God.
The righteous ones will be in Heaven.
Sitting on luxurious furnishings they will enjoy the most eye pleasing views.
You can see from their faces how delighted they are.
They will drink the most delicious exotic drinks which…
…. smells like musk. If you have any aspiration compete for it.
The drink will be mixed with the water of Tasnin.
Which is a spring from which only those who are dear to God will drink.
They will remember the day that the sinners used to laugh at them.
The disbelievers used to wink at each other whenever they passed by the believers.
And return to their folks continue joking about the believers.
Saying what invisible guards…
… they think they have around them.
On that day, the believers will have the final laugh.
While enjoying the sight from their throne.
Are not the disbelievers paid back for what they were used to do?
The time will come…
… when the sky will submit to the will of its Creator and cracks down into pieces.
The time will come that earth will be leveled.
On that day the earth…
… will submit to the will of its Creator and explode into pieces into skies.
Know that man one day will meet his Creator. Meanwhile, he has to struggle hard to earn his Lord’s pleasure.
The one who is given his record to his right hand…
… will be happy as he will have an easy meeting with his Lord.
Such a man will return happy to his people.
As for the one whose record….
… will be hang behind his neck, he will be…
…. terribly sorry as he will be throne into the Hellfire.
Such a person was the most happy among his buddies (who were like him.)
It never came to such a person’s mind that one day he will meet his Creator and would be accountable for his actions.
Indeed his Lord was watching him.
I (God) swear by the impressive red color of the dusk.
I (God) swear by the night which spreads over the earth.
I (God) swear by the moon and its phases.
That man will move from stage to stage.
How come man after all this does not believe his Creator’s word?
How is it possible that man hears the word of God (as written in Qur’an) and does not prostrate out of respect?
The answer is: “These people have the audacity to knowingly reject the word of God (as penned down in Qur’an)”.
Indeed God is aware of the innermost thought of these kind of people.
O’ Mohammad, let people know that there is a terrible punishment awaiting them.
Only those who believe and adopt a “God pleasing” style of life will receive a well deserved reward.
I (God) swear by the galaxies.
I (God) promises by the promised Day of Judgment.
I ( God) swear by the one who witnesses and those against whom the witness is borne.
That a blazing Hellfire is…
… already prepared for the people of Ochoa who will be thrown in.
They where the ones who…
… threw the believers in the fire and were watching them to be burnt.
They hated the believers for no other reason than believing in God, the All-mighty, Worthy of Praise.
To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God is watching over.
Those who persecute the believers, and do not take advantage of the time that God has given them to repent, they will suffer in the Hell and will be thrown in the Hellfire.
The believers, who choose a “God pleasing” style of life, on the contrary, will end up in the beautiful gardens of the Heaven where the streams of water flow. This is indeed a real achievement.
God’s Might and His punishment is indeed the greatest.
Your Creator is the One Who creates and then let his creation to reproduce itself and go through the evolutionary process.
Your Lord is Forgiving and Loving.
God is the owner of the glorious throne.
God does whatever pleases Him.
Have you ever heard the story of…
… the people of Thamud and Pharaoh and their destiny?
The disbelievers are infected with…
… the disease of “denial” and God is fully aware of their situation.
This Qur’an is a Glorious Book.
Know that God has preserved Qur’an in a master tablet far away from the people’s reach to be tampered with.
God hereby swears by the awesomeness of the sky…
and the shining star of the morning that nobody know its nature and…
its light is penetrating throughout the universe.
That every soul has a protector.
O’ mankind, God is asking you to think for a while from what you are created.
From a tiny insignificant….
… sperm [that may be seen only with a powerful microscope] created between the back bone and the rib.
The same God Who created man out of nothing can surely summon him (after his death) to meet his Creator.
On that day there shall be…
… no such thing as manifest and hidden and man will have neither the power nor a helper.
I (God) swear by the same sky…
… that returns the water back to the earth and by the earth which opens up (by the force of the growing vegetation) that…
this scripture is not….
…. something to be taken for lightly.
The disbelievers constantly scheme wicked plans (to discredit this Qur’an).
The disbelievers do not realize that I (God) too have a plan of mine!
In this game, the disbelievers are given enough time to ridicule themselves; so let them do their best.
Glorified be the name of your Lord Who is the Highest.
Your Lord is the One Who created everything and then destined them to continue their lives toward perfection [confirmation of the theory of evolution].
Your Lord is the One Who guides his creatures to their final destiny.
Your Lord is the One Who…
… colonize the earth with plants and then transfers it into a bunch of hay.
Your Lord will endow you with the ability to recite as much as…
…. He desires so that you do not forget. God knows everything which is hidden and everything which is clear and obvious
God hereby promises to make your path easy to pave.
Keep God in your mind and recite His words constantly.
The one who keeps God in mind will be mindful of his every action.
Only the wicked people will avoid God’s remembrance.
Those who forget God will…
… end up in the great Hell Fire where they will neither die nor enjoy the life.
The successful one is indeed the one who purifies his soul and…
…. glorifies the name of his Lord and worship him on regular basis.
Mankind should realize that this worldly life is worth nothing;….
…. it is life after death which is worth and ever lasting.
The above mentioned fact is not something new.
It was mentioned longtime ago in the scriptures revealed to Abraham and Moses.
Have you ever heard about an awesome event which man is going to witness?
In that day, some faces will be downward of shame.
Looking exhausted,
As they enter into the Hell Fire.
Imagine what a torture it is to drink from boiling water of Hell.
And have nothing to eat but a bitter fruit full of thorns.
Which after all will not reduce the hunger as it is not nutritious.
On the other hand, on that day there will be faces full of joy.
These are those who are happy with their accomplishment.
And will be led to the gardens of Paradise.
Where they will hear no unpleasant words.
And enjoy the springs of Paradise.
While relaxing on high thrones.
They will drink delightful drinks offered to them in the cups.
Relaxed in cushions put next to each other.
And the silk carpet spread for them in the gardens.
Don’t you contemplate on God’s creations around you such as the camel [that your livelihood in the desert depends upon]?
And the (majestic) sky above you?
And the firm mountains reaching the sky?
And the earth itself which is made spread for you?
O’ Mohammad, make them open their eyes as your only job is to be a reminder.
Mohammad, bear in mind that you are not in charge of them [and your job is only to remind them.]
Let them know that whoever turns away from your admonitions,
God will impose a terrible punishment upon them.
As they will eventually have to return back and meet their Lord.
On that day, they have to answer to what they have been doing.
Hereby God swears by the dawn,
and by ten [important] nights [in Islam ( the first ten nights of Zul- Hadj or the last ten nights of Ramadan).]
and by even and the odd [it may refer to the exactness of mathematics or to the he contrast]
and by the night when it turns into the day.
Indeed in all these oaths there are subjects of thought for the thinkers.
Do you know how your Lord dealt with the nation of Ad [an ancient tribe who refused to submit themselves to the will of God and were accordingly dealt with].
The residents of the city of Eram…
… who were living in such beautiful houses that nobody had built anything like it before.
And the nation of Thamud whose people had built their houses inside the rocky mountain.
And the mighty Pharaoh who…
…. was such a tyrant in governing his land.
They were merciless tyrants.
So your Lord punished them in earth with a portion of punishment which they will receive in the Hell.
Your Lord did that in order to remind mankind that He is watching.
When man is being tried in wealth [to see how he behaves], he considers it as a God’s reward.
When man is being tried in poverty [to see how he handles the situation], he considers it as a God’s punishment!
How awful of you people who…
… treat the orphan badly,…
… do not care about the hungry one, cheat each other from the inheritance and…
… love the wealth exceedingly.
Be mindful of a day that earth explodes with a quake and you will meet your Lord…
… being accompanied by the angles.
You will then be mindful when you see the Hell being shown to you.
Then man will be sorry that he has not sent any good deed as a preparation for his life after death.
God’s punishment (passed to the guilty one) on that day, is not comparable with any punishment that man has ever suffered with.
Man is never taken to account as he will be taken to account by God on that day.
The righteous one, on the contrary, will be offered a heavenly peace.
He will be said: “Come back to your Lord; He is pleased with you and you will be pleased with Him.”
You deserve to be knighted as My servant;…
… enter into the Heaven and enjoy it.
I (God) swear by this very city of Mecca.
That you (Mohammad) are not responsible for what the citizens of Mecca are doing.
You (Mohammad) are not responsible for the behavior of neither the parents nor the sons of anyone.
It is true that man has been created with a psychological trait….
… that he thinks that he is the most powerful one and that no one can overpower him.
He proudly brags about how much money he has spent upon his vices [gambling, sex, bribes, etc.]
Does not he realize that God is watching?
Does man not realize that it is I (God) who have given him a pair of eyes [to see the right and the wrong], a tongue [to tell the truth or to lie] and…
…. two lips [ to let the tongue witness the truth or to hide the truth].
Does man not realize that I (God) have clearly indicated to him that there are two paths in life to pave.
What a shame that man does not chose the path which is going upward to Heaven.
If you want to know..
…. what type of actions will put the man in the right path,….
… the answer is very easy: Freeing a slave [in any form and shape] and….
…. feeding a hungry person (no matter if he is an orphan whom you know or…
a stranger which is stricken by poverty).
The one who engages in the type of actions which pleases God deserves to be led to the straight path. Such a person will be rewarded with belief and will invite his fellow believer to be patient when they are overpowered and to be merciful when they have the upper hand.
Such people will be gathered on the right hand side of the God [on the Day of Judgment] to be taken to the Heaven.
As for those who deny the invitation of God to pave the right path, they will be gathered on the left hand side…
…of the God [on the Day of Judgment] to be taken to the Hell where they will be engulfed by the Fire.
Hereby God swears by the sun and its brightness.
And by the moon which follows the sun.
And by the day that takes over the darkness after sun appears.
And by the night that takes over the day.
And by the universe and the One Who created it.
And by the earth and the One Who spread it.
And by the life itself which is going through evolution toward being perfect.
That God has clearly indicated what is right and what is wrong for man.
The successful person is indeed the one who purify himself by controlling those desires which are listed as evil by God.
The looser, on the contrary, is the one who does not believe in good and evil as indicated by God and commits evil deeds.
Be reminded that before you, people of Thamud rebelled against God and denied his criteria.
When the most wicked person among them went to kill the she camel (that they themselves had asked as a miracle.)
Their prophet begged them not kill the she camel that had appeared among them as a sign of God's covenant with them and let her to drink the water.
They laughed at him and killed the camel (as a sign of rebellion and challenging God.)
God does not care about what a dreadful punishment His rebellious creatures knowingly earn for themselves.
Hereby God swears by the night as it covers the earth.
And by the day which appears after night with its glorious light in the morning.
And by the One Who creates male and female in a proportional order to carry on the life.
There are many style of life that man has absolute freedom to choose.
The one who chooses to get involved in charitable actions and adores God with awe.
And believes in Goodness.
God will make his path to the salvation easy.
But the one who is greedy, not generous and thinks that he does not need anyone,
and makes mockery of charity and Goodness.
God will not mind as the devil take over him and lead him to the wrong path.
What good does his wealth make for him while he is slipping gradually toward Hell?
Truly God provides only the Guidance.
By assuring man that an ever lasting pleasure of Hereafter is better than a few day pleasure of this world.
I (God) hereby warn you of the Blazing Fire of Hell.
That only the miserable rebellious one will be thrown in.
The one who denies God and turns to devil.
As far as those who have obeyed God they will be spared from the Hell.
They are the ones who purify their invoke by spending a part of it for charity.
Without expecting any reward from the one that they have favored by their charitable actions.
They simply do it to please God.
God indeed will be pleased with them.
Hereby God swears by the glorious early sun light.
Also God swears by the stillness of night.
That God has not left you alone and that He does not dislike you.
Bear in mind that your Hereafter home is much better that your trnsitionary worldly place that you are living in for a while.
Pretty soon your Lord will take you to your “real” home where you will be enchanted with it.
Why do you think that your Lord does not like you while you (Mohammad) were an orphan and He gave you a shelter and protected you.
And for the longest time (years) you were lost in darkness and live like a pagan and He revealed you the truth about the meaning of the life, why you are here, etc.
Have you (Mohammad) forgotten that you were a poor lad and He made you a rich man?
Therefore, you owe your Lord to be nice to the orphans.
And be kind to the needy ones.
And as God made gave you awareness, make it a business of yours to aware all the world and take them out of darkness to the light of knowledge.
Have I (God) not relieved you [Mohammad/ mankind] from the hardships…
…by giving you a peaceful feeling and…
…. removing your burden that was pressing your back?
Have I (God) not raised you to a honorable position?
Then know that there is always a relief after hardship.
I (God) repeat: “There is always a relief after hardship.”
Therefore, anytime that you are relieved from a hardship,…
… show your gratitude by worshipping your Lord.
God, hereby, swears by the fig…
… and the olive; by Mount Sinai and…
… the honored city of Mecca that:
I (God) have created man in the best of moulds.
Then man was turned (in account of his actions) into lowest of the lowest.
Except those who believe and do good things; a continuous reward is in reserve for them.
As for you the disbelievers:…
… “why do not you believe that God is the best of the judges (and has to do justice by condemning you to hell)?
Read in the name of your Lord Who has created you.
God is the One Who created you from a small piece of thick blood (tiny embryo).
Read and praise your Lord Who…
.. taught you how to use the pen [and in this way separated you from other animals who cannot use the pen]
[Be grateful to your] Lord Who taught man what he did not know before.
What a shame that mankind is ungrateful and…
… thinks that he is not in need of his Lord and that he has power to do everything.
Beware mankind that one day you have to meet your creator.
Have you seen the one who…
… prevents his subordinates to worship the Lord? [Like those who do not let people pray at schools or at work place]
Does it not make sense to such a person…
… to be on the right path and advocate righteousness?
How dare he to turn his back to the truth (Qur’an)?
Does not such a person know that God is watching?
Let him [Abu Jahl the most persistent enemy of Islam] know that…
… if he continues his animosity toward Islam, I (God) will grab him by his lying, sinful forehead to the fire.
While he is being dragged to fire,…
… let him call upon his supporters to meet God’s supporters (angles of punishment).
Do not follow the enemies of Islam; follow your Lord and fall down prostrate in adoration and draw yourself in this way closer and closer to your Lord
What a night it is that Qur’an was revealed in it.
There is no way that you understand how honorable the night of the revelation of Qur’an is.
The night of light and power in which Qur’an was revealed is more honorable than one thousand nights.
To commemorate and glorify that night, the Angles and Spirit descend to earth with the permission of God All-Mighty.
Peace be on that night till the very last moment of its dawn.
It is obvious that the followers of the scriptures, as well as the idol worshipers, would not have followed Islam unless a clear proof was sent to them.
This clear proof is Qur’an which its authentic pages is being recited by Mohammad, a messenger of God.
Qur’an contains authentic scriptures (Lord’s laws and orders.)
As a matter of fact, those who received the older scriptures did not dispute about the message when it was revealed to them (it happened later when they started to tamper with the scriptures).
All was asked from them was to serve God, being sincere to him in obedience, Worship God on regular basis, engage in charitable actions; This is what the true religion is.
Those of old religions (who have seen the clear proof and knowingly have refused it), as well as the idol worshipers, have bought the Hell Fire for themselves and are the worse people.
Those who have believed and engage in good actions, are the best people.
God will reward the latter by sending them to the gardens of Paradise, where the rivers flew beneath it, and they will live there forever. God will be pleased with them and they will be pleased with God. Such is the reward of those who feared God.
When the earth shakes with the worse quake ever…
… and explodes throwing out all its matter.
And the man will wonder what is happening.
On that day the history of earth will be revealed.
As Lord has commanded it.
On that day human beings will be herded in groups to review whatever they have done in their earthly lifetime.
Whoever has done an atom of a good work will see it.
Whoever has done an atom of an evil work will see it.
God hereby swears by the fast gallopers,….
igniting sparks,…
…. raiders in the morning, …..
….the dust of the raid raising to sky….
…. and the army that penetrates to the heart of the rival clan’s territory,
That most surely man is ungrateful to his Lord.
Man’s actions bear witness that….
… he loves material things excessively.
Does man not realize that one day all graves will be open…
….. and all his secrets will be shown to public during his trial?
Man will find out in that day that God has always been watching and knew all about them.
The Great Disaster!
What is the Great Disaster?
What do you know about the day of Great Disaster?
The day of Great Disaster is the one the all mankind will be scattered all over like moths wondering with awe.
In that day, the upright mountains will be reduced to soft tissues like loosened wool.
Then the one whose good deeds on the balance is higher than his bad deeds.
Will be sent to the paradise where he will have a pleasant life forever.
The One whose evil deeds exceeds his good deeds,
He will be sent to a pit in the Hell.
You are asking what is awaiting him in the Hell.
The answer is: “ A Blazing Fire.”
Working hard to pile up wealth distracts you from higher goals.
Until you are brought to your grave.
Only then your eyes will open up to truth.
Only then you will know.
If you knew it before (you would not have devoted all your time to work, work and work to pile up wealth.)
Yes, indeed you will see the Blazing Fire of Hell.
And then your eyes believe in what they see.
Then it will be time to ask you about how you devoted your life to worldly pleasures.
Hereby God swears by time.
that human beings are most definitely in loss.
Except those who believe in God and do good deeds and get together in mutual learning/ teaching of the truth, and of the patience.
How sad is the case of a back biter and slanderer.
He piles up wealth and is proud of his worldly “achievements”.
Thinking that his wealth will render him immortal.
He will surely be thrown into the crushing Fire.
If you knew what the crushing Fire is.
It is a Fire prepared by All Mighty Himself.
Which rises above the hearts.
And covers the guilty one.
As tall as huge columns
Have you not seen the mighty army fortified by the elephants
Didn’t God bring their might down to nothing.
By sending upon them birds with…
… the stones on their beck to stone them.
And made their battle field like an empty field of stalks and straws.
For the protection of the tribe of Quraish.
For the protection of their trading caravans in the summer and in the winter.
Let them worship the Lord of this house of worship (Kabah- Mecca).
The same Lord who provides them with food when they are hungry and with security when they are in danger.
Have you noticed the behavior of those who claim to be Muslims but from Islam do not carry anything but its name?
These hypocrites are those who do not show any kindness to the orphans.
These hypocrites are those who do not take any step to feed a hungry person.
How dare these hypocrites to consider themselves a God’s worshipper.
These hypocrites do no even attend their mandatory prayers regularly.
The hypocrite’s engagement in charitable activities is not out of sincerity and is merely in order to be seen and earn a good name in public.
The hypocrites may spend a lot of money to be known as charitable people, but they refuse to engage in small kindnesses (say Hi to the doorman, smile to their low level employees, buy a burger to the hungry man in the street, etc. etc. etc.)
Indeed you are destined to have the pleasure of enjoying the river named kusar in Paradise.
Therefore, in order to show your thank in advance worship your lord and make a sacrifice.
Surely your enemy will soon be “cut off” (humiliated.)
Mohammad; Say to disbelievers (who knowingly cover up the truth):
“ I do not worship what you worship”
“Nor do you worship the One that I worship”
“I will never worship what you worship”
“And you will never worship what I worship”
“Therefore, you worship whatever you desire and I will worship none but God”.
When with God’s Help the final victory is achieved .
and you (Mohammad) see people convert into Islam by groups.
Then glorify and thank your Lord and ask for forgiveness; indeed He is the Most Forgiving.
The power of Abu Lahab will soon be destroyed and his hands cutoff.
Neither his wealth nor his worldly accomplishments will be of any help to him.
He shall soon be thrown in the Hell in a fire with high flames.
And his wife will be put in charge of carrying wood for this Fire.
while being pulled by a twisted rope of palm fiber put around her neck.
O’ Mohammad; say to mankind that: “God is the one and only God.
God is Solid (and does not need anyone’s help.)
God is neither born nor has given birth (to have a son or a daughter.)
and none is like Him.”
Say: “I seek refuge in the Lord (Who makes) the Down (appear from the depth of darkness:)
from the evil caused by anything that He has created,
from the evils taking place when God covers the earth with the darkness of night,
from the evil of those who practice witchcraft,
and from the evil of those who envy.”
Say: “I seek refuge in mankind’s Teacher (i.e., God).
The One Who is the Ruler of mankind.
The One Who is the Lord of mankind.
(I beg the Master to protect me) From the evil of the sneaking whisperers.
Who (constantly) whisper (alternative ways of life) into people’s mind.
Whoever these evils might be: Jinns (E.T.s) or (ordinary) people.”
