In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.
All Praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds,
The Beneficent, the Merciful,
The Ruler of the Day of Judgment!
Thee  alone we serve and Thee alone we ask for aid
Guide us in the Straight Path,
The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; not of those who earn Thy wrath; nor of those who go astray.
ALIF LAM MIM.	
This is the Book! There is no doubt therein; a guide to the pious, 
Who believe in the unseen, and are steadfast in worship, and spend of what We have given them; 
Who believe in what is revealed to you  (Muhammad), and what was revealed before you, and are sure of the Hereafter. 
These are guided by their Lord, and these are the successful.
Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them if you warn them or if you warn them not, they will not believe. 
Allah has set a seal upon their heart and on their hearing; and on their eyes is dimness, and for them is grievous woe. 
And there are those among men who say, "We believe in Allah and in the last day;" but they do not believe. 
They would deceive Allah and those who do believe; but they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive. 
In their heart is a sickness, and Allah has made them still more sick, and for them is grievous woe because they lied. 
And when it is said to them, "Do not evil in the earth," they say, "We do only what is right"
Are not they the evildoers? And yet they do not perceive!
And when it is said to them, "Believe as other men believe," they say, "Shall we believe as fools believe?" Are not they themselves the fools? And yet they do not know. 
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We do believe;" but when they go aside with their devils, they say, "We are with you; we were but mocking!"
Allah shall mock at them and let them go on in their rebellion, blindly wandering on.
Those who buy error for guidance, their traffic profits not, and they are not guided. 
Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindles a fire; and when it lights up all around, Allah goes off with their light, and leaves them in darkness that they cannot see.
Deaf, dumb, blind, and they shall not return! 
Or like a storm-cloud from the sky, wherein is darkness and thunder and lightning; they put their fingers in their ears at the thunder-clap, for fear of death, for Allah encompasses the disbelievers. 
The lightning well-nigh snatches off their sight, whenever it shines for them they walk therein; but when it is dark for them they halt; and if Allah willed He would go off with their hearing and their sight; verily, Allah is mighty over all.
O you folk! Serve (adore) your Lord (Guardian) who created you and those before you; per chance (or possibly) you may fear evil (learn righteousness)! 
Who made the earth for you a bed and the heaven a canopy; and sent down from heaven water, and brought forth therewith fruits for your sustenance; so make no peers (rivals) for Allah, when you know better!
 And if you are in doubt of what we have revealed unto Our servant, then bring a chapter like it, and call your witnesses other than Allah if you tell truth. 
But if you do it not - and you surely cannot - then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for disbelievers. 
But bear the glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow; whenever they are provided with fruit there from they say, "This is what we were provided with before," and they shall be provided with their similitude; and there are pure companions for them therein, and they shall dwell therein for ever.
Behold! Allah does not disdain to set forth a similitude even of a gnat, or anything lower or higher; and as for those who believe, they know that it is truth from the Lord; but as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What is it that Allah means by this as a parable? He leads astray many and He guides many;"- but He leads astray only the evildoers; 
Those who break Allah's covenant after the fixing thereof, and cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined, and do evil in the earth, these it is who are losers. 
How can you disbelieve in Allah, when you were dead and He made you alive, and then He will cause you to die, and then make you alive again, and then to Him will you return?
It is He who created for you all that is in the earth, and He designed the heavens also and fashioned (ordered) them as seven heavens; and He knows all things. 
And when your Lord said unto the angels, "I am about to place a Vicegerent (Agent, Successor, Inheritor) in the earth," they said, "Will you place therein one who will do evil therein and shed blood? While we celebrate Thy praise and glorify Thee." Said (the Lord), "I know what you know not." 
And He taught Adam the Names (qualities), all of them; then He propounded them to the angels and said, "Declare to Me the names of these, if you are truthful." 
They said, "Glory be to Thee! No knowledge is ours but what Thou Thyself have taught us, verily, you are the Knower, the Wise." 
Said the Lord, "O Adam declare to them the Names;" and when he had declared to them the Names, He said, "Did I not say to you, I know the secrets of the heavens and of the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?" 
And when we said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam," they bowed before him save only Iblis, who refused and was too proud and became one of the disbelievers. 
And we said, "O Adam dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise, and eat there from amply as you wish; but do not draw near this tree or you will be of the transgressors. 
But Satan made them backslide there from and drove them out from what they were in, and We said, "Go down, one of you the enemy of the other, and in the earth there is an abode and a provision for a time." 
And Adam obtained certain words (revelations) from his Lord, and He relented towards him, for He is the Relenting, the Compassionate.
We said, "Go down there from altogether and per chance (or possibly) there may come from Me a Guidance, and whoever follows My Guidance, no fear is theirs, nor shall they grieve. 
But those who disbelieve, and call Our signs lies, they are the fellows of the Fire, they shall dwell therein for ever."
O you children of Israel! Remember My favours which I have favoured you with; fulfil My Covenant and I will fulfil your covenant; therefore, fear Me. 
Believe in what I have revealed, verifying what you have got, and be not the first to disbelieve in it, and do not barter My signs for a little price, and keep your duty to Me. 
Cloak not truth with vanity and falsehood, nor knowingly hide the truth.
Be steadfast in worship, give alms, and bow down with those who bow.
Will you order men to piety and forget it yourselves? You read the Book, do you not then understand? 
Seek aid with patience and prayer, though it is a hard thing save for the humble, 
Who know that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him they are returning.
O you children of Israel! Remember My favours which I have favoured you with, and that I have preferred you above all others in the world. 
Fear the day wherein no soul shall pay any recompense for another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted for it, nor shall compensation be taken from it, nor shall they be helped.
When We saved you from Pharaoh's people who sought to wreak evil and woe on you, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live; in that was a great trial for you from your Lord. 
When We divided for you the sea and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's people while you looked on.
When We treated with Moses forty nights, then you chose the calf after he had gone and you did wrong. 
Yet then We forgave you after that; perhaps you may be grateful. 
And remember when We gave Moses the Scriptures and the Criterion; you had a chance to be guided. 
And remember when Moses said to his people, "O my people! You have wronged yourselves in taking this calf; repent unto your Creator and kill the guilty yourselves; that will be better for you in your Creator's eyes; and He relented towards you, for He is the Oft Relenting, the Merciful.
And remember when you said to Moses, "O Moses! We will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly," and the thunderbolt caught you while you yet looked on. 
Then We raised you up after your death; perhaps you may be grateful.
And We overshadowed you with the cloud, and sent down the manna and the quails; "Eat of the good things we have given you." They did not wrong Us, but it was themselves they were wronging. 
And when We said, "Enter this city and eat there from as plentifully as you wish; and enter the gate worshipping and say "hittatun" (repentance and surrender to Allah). So will We pardon you your sins and give increase unto those who do right."
But those who did wrong changed it for another word than that which was said to them: and We sent down upon those who did wrong, wrath from heaven for that they had so sinned.
When Moses, too, asked drink for his people and We said, "Strike with your staff the rock," and from it burst forth twelve springs; each tribe among them knew his drinking place. "Eat and drink of what Allah has provided, and transgress not on the earth as evildoers."
And when they said: "Moses, we cannot always bear one kind of food; pray then to your Lord to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its green herbs, its cucumbers, its garlic, its lentils, and its onions." Said He, "Do you ask what is meaner instead of what is better? Go down to Egypt (or any town), - there is what you ask." Then were they smitten with abasement and poverty, and met with wrath from Allah. That was because they had disbelieved in Allah's signs and killed the prophets undeservedly; that was because they were rebellious and had transgressed.
Verily, whether it be of those who believe, or those who are Jews or Christians or Sabaeans, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and acts aright, they have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.
And when We took a covenant with you and held the mountain over you; (saying) "Accept what We have brought you with strong will, and bear in mind what is therein, per chance (or possibly) you yet may fear."
Then even after that did you turn aside, and were it not for Allah's grace towards you and His mercy, you would have been of those who lose. 
You know also of those among you who transgressed upon the Sabbath, and how We said to them, “Be you (as) apes, despised and spurned."
Thus We made them an example unto those who stood before them, and those who should come after them, and a warning unto those who fear Allah.
And remember when Moses said to his people, "Allah bids you slaughter a heifer." they said, "Are you making a jest of us?" Said he, "I seek refuge with Allah from being one of the unwise."
They said, "Then pray to your Lord for us to show us what she is to be." He answered, "He said it is a cow, not old, nor young, of middle age between the two; so do as you are bid." 
They said, "Pray now to your Lord to show us what her colour is to be." He answered, "He said it is a fawn-coloured heifer, intensely fawn, her colour delighting those who look upon her."
Again they said, "Pray to your Lord to show us what she is to be; for cows appear the same to us; then we, if Allah will, shall be guided." 
He answered, "He said, it is a heifer, not broken in to plough the earth or irrigate the tilth, a sound one with no blemish on her." They said, "Now have you brought the truth." And they slaughtered her, though they came near leaving it undone (without goodwill).
Remember when you slew a soul and disputed thereupon, and Allah brought forth that which you had hidden, 
Then We said, "Strike him with part of her (the heifer)." Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, that per chance (or possibly) you may understand.
Yet were your heart hardened even after that, till they were as rocks or harder still, for verily, there are some rocks from which streams burst forth, and others burst asunder and water issues out, and others there are that sink down for fear of Allah; but Allah is never careless of what you do.
Do you hope that they should believe you when already a sect of them have heard the word of Allah and then perverted it knowingly after they had understood it?
Behold, when they meet men of faith they say, "We believe," but when they meet in private they say, "Will you talk to them of what Allah has opened up (revealed) to you, that they may argue with you upon it before your Lord? Do you not therefore understand?" 
Do they not then know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they make known abroad?
And some of them there are, illiterate folk, that know not the Book, but their own fancies, conjectures and idle tales. 
But woe to those who write out the Book with their own hands and say "This is from Allah"; to buy therewith a little price! And woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they gain!
And then they say, "Hell fire shall not touch us save for a few number of days." Say, "Have you taken a covenant with Allah?" but Allah breaks not His covenant. Or do you say of Allah that which you do not know?
Nay, whoever gains an evil gain, and is encompassed by his sins, those are the fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein for ever. 
But such as act aright, those are the fellows of Paradise, and they shall dwell therein for ever.
And remember when We took from the children of Israel a covenant, saying, "Serve you none but Allah, and to your two parents show kindness, and to your kindred and the orphans and the needy, and speak to men kindly, and be steadfast in prayer, and give alms;" and then you turned back, save a few of you, and you backslide (even now).
And remember when We took a covenant from you, "shed not your kinsman's blood, nor turn your kinsmen out of their homes:" then did you confirm it and were witnesses thereto. 
Yet you were those who slay your kinsmen and turn a party out of their homes, and back each other up against them with sin and enmity. But if they come to you as captives you ransom them! - and yet it is as unlawful for you to turn them out. Do you then believe in part of the Book and reject the rest? But the reward of such among you as do that shall be naught else but disgrace in this worldly life, and on the day of Judgment shall they be driven to the most grievous torment, for Allah is not unmindful of what you do.
Those who have bought this worldly life with the price of the Hereafter, the torment shall not be lightened from them nor shall they be helped.
We gave Moses the Book and We followed him up with other apostles, and We gave Jesus the son of Mary manifest signs and aided him with the Holy Spirit. Do you then, every time an apostle comes to you with what your souls love not, scorn him with pride, and charge some with lying and slay others?
They say, "Our heart are wrappings (preserving Allah's truth)" nay, Allah has cursed them in their unbelief, and few it is who do believe (or little it is they believe). 
And when a Book came down from Allah confirming what they had with them, though they had before prayed for victory over the faithless, yet when that came to them, which they recognised, then they refused to believe it. Allah's curse is on the faithless.
For a miserable price have they sold their souls, in not believing what Allah has revealed, grudging because Allah sends down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He will; and they have brought on themselves wrath after wrath and for the disbelievers is there shameful woe.
And when they are told to believe in what Allah has revealed, they say, "We believe in what has been revealed to us only;" but they disbelieve in all beside, although it is the truth confirming what they have. Say, "Why did you kill Allah's prophets in past times if you were true believers?"
Moses came to you with manifest signs, then you took up with the calf when he had gone and did wrong.
And remember when We took a covenant with you and raised the mountain (Sinai) over you, "Take what We have given you with resolution and hear (the Law);" they said, "We hear but disobey;" and they were made to drink (the sin of) the calf down into their heart for their faithlessness. Say, "A vile thing is it which your faith bids you do, if you have any faith."
Say, "If the abode with Allah is your s alone and not for mankind, then seek you for death if you are sincere." 
But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent on before them; but Allah is well acquainted with the wrong doers.
Why, you will find them the greediest of men for life; even more than the idolaters; each one would fain live for a thousand years,- but he will not be reprieved from punishment by being allowed to live that long, for Allah sees what they do.
Say, "Who is an enemy to Gabriel? For he has revealed to your heart, with Allah's permission, confirmation of what had been before, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers. 
Who is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His apostles and Gabriel and Michael? - Verily, Allah is an enemy to the unbelievers. 
We have sent down to you conspicuous signs, and none will disbelieve therein except the perverse. 
Or every time they make a covenant, will a part of them repudiate it? Nay, most of them are faithless.
And when there comes to them an apostle confirming what they have, a party of those who have received the Book repudiate Allah's book, casting it behind their backs as though they did not know. 
And they follow that which the devils recited against Solomon's kingdom;- it was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils who disbelieved, teaching men sorcery, and what has been revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut, at Babylon, yet neither taught any one until they said, "We are but a temptation, so do not blaspheme." Men learn from them only that by which they may part man and wife; but they can harm no one therewith, unless with the permission of Allah, and they learn what hurts them, not what profits them. And they knew that those who indulge in magic would have no share in the bliss of the Hereafter. Vile is the price of that for which they sell their souls, if they but knew.
If they had kept their faith and protected themselves from evil, far better had been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew. 
O you men of faith! Say not "rahina" (a word having ambiguous meanings, including "attend to us") but say "unthurna" (an unambiguous word having the same meaning), but words of respect and hearken; for to disbelievers shall be grievous woe.
They who disbelieve, whether of those who have the Book or of the idolaters, would fain that no good were sent down to you from your Lord; but Allah especially favours with His mercy whom He will, for Allah is Lord of abounding Grace.
Whatever verse We may annul or cause you  to forget, We will bring a better one than it, or one like it; do you not know that Allah has power over all? 
Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? Nor have you besides Allah a patron or a helper.
Do you wish to question your Messenger, as Moses was questioned in the past? But whoever takes disbelief in exchange for faith has erred from the Level Way (sawaa = even, smooth, symmetrical, proportionate, righteous, balanced, appropriate, relevant).
Many of those who have the Book would fain turn you back into infidelity after you have once believed, through selfish envy, after the truth has been made manifest to them; but pardon and shun them till Allah accomplishes His purpose; verily, Allah is mighty over all.
Be you steadfast in prayer, and regular in charity; and whatsoever good you send before you for your own souls, you shall find it with Allah, for Allah sees all you do.
They say, "None shall enter Paradise save such as be Jews or Christians;" that is their vain desire. Say thou, "Bring your proofs, if you are speaking truth."
Nay, whoever surrenders his face (his countenance, nature, honour, glory, cause, will, his whole self) to Allah, and does good, he shall have his reward from his Lord, and no fear shall be on them, and they shall not grieve.
The Jews say, "The Christians base themselves on naught;" and the Christians say, "The Jews base themselves on naught"; and yet both read the (same) Book. They say the same things as those people say who know not; but Allah shall judge between them on the Day of Judgment concerning that whereon they dispute.
But who is more unjust than he who forbids that His name should not be mentioned in the places for the worship of Allah, and who strives to ruin them? It is not fitting for such to enter into them except in fear. For them is disgrace in this world, and in the world to come, mighty woe.
To Allah belongs the East and the West, and wherever you turn there is Allah's face (presence); for verily, Allah is All-pervading and All-Knowing.
They say, "Allah takes unto Himself a son." All Glory is to Him! Nay, His is whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and all things worship (obey, glorify, praise) Him.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, when He decrees a matter He does but say unto it, "BE," and it is.
And those without knowledge say, "Why does not Allah speak to us?" or "Why does no sign come to us?". So spoke those before them in words of similar meaning. Their hearts are all alike. We have made manifest the signs unto a people that are sure.
Verily, We have sent you with the truth, a bearer of good tidings and of warning, and you shall not be questioned as to the fellows of hell.
The Jews will not be satisfied with you, nor yet the Christians, until you follow their creed. Say, "Allah's guidance is the (sufficient, correct or only) guidance;" and if you were to follow their lusts (desires, prejudices, fantasies, superstitions) after the knowledge that has come to you, you have not then from Allah a patron or a help.
They to whom We have brought the Book and who read it as it should be studied, they are the ones that believe therein; and whoever rejects faith therein, it is they who are the losers.
O children of Israel! Remember My favours which I bestowed on you, and that I have preferred you over the (other people of the) worlds. 
And fear the day when no soul shall pay a recompense for another soul, nor shall an equivalent be received there from, nor any intercession avail; and they shall not be helped.
And remember when his Lord tried Abraham with words, and he fulfiled them, He said, "Verily, I will set you as an Imam (high priest, leader, model, example, guide) for the nations." Said he, "And of my seed also?" Allah said, "My covenant touches not the evildoers."
And when We made the House (Kaaba) a place of assembly unto men, and a sanctuary, and (said to them) "take the station of Abraham for a place of prayer"; and covenanted with Abraham and Ishmael, saying, "Do you two cleanse my house for those who make the circuit, for those who pay devotions there, for those who bow down, and for those too who adore."
When Abraham said, "Lord, make this a City of Peace, and provide the dwellers there with fruits, such as believe in Allah and the Last Day!" (Allah) said, "And he who reject the faith, I will give him but little to enjoy, then will soon drive him to the torment of the fire, an evil destination will it be."
And when Abraham raised up the foundations of the House with Ishmael, (with this prayer) "Lord! Receive it from us, verily, you are All-Hearing and All-Knowing. 
Lord! Make us Muslims (submissive) unto Thee, and of our seed also a nation of Muslims (resigned), bowing to Thy will, and show us our rites, and turn towards us, verily, Thou art the Oft-Relenting, the Most Merciful.
"Our Lord! Send them an apostle of their own, to read to them Thy signs and teach them the Scripture and Wisdom, and to purify them; verily, you are the Mighty and the Wise."
Who is averse from the religion of Abraham save one who is foolish of soul? For We have chosen him in this world, and in the Hereafter he is surely in the ranks of the righteous.
Behold! His Lord said to him, "Surrender" he said, "I have surrendered unto the Lord of the worlds."
And Abraham instructed his sons therein, and so did Jacob (saying), "O my sons! Verily, Allah has chosen for you the (true) religion, do not therefore die save as those who have surrendered (as Muslims).
Were you then witnesses when Jacob was facing death, when he said to his sons, "What will you serve when I am gone?" They said, "We will serve your God, the God of your fathers Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, one God; and unto Him have we surrendered."
That is a nation that has passed away, theirs is what they gained; and your s shall be what you have gained; you shall not be questioned as to that which they have done.
They say, "Become you Jews or Christians then shall you be guided by Abraham." Say, "Not so! But we follow the religion of Abraham, the upright; he was not of the idolaters."
Say you "We believe in Allah, and what has been revealed to us, and what has been revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was brought to Moses and Jesus, and what was brought unto the Prophets from their Lord; we make no distinction between any one of them, and unto Him have we surrendered."
If they believe in that in which you believe, then are on the right path; but if they turn back, then are they only in a schism, and Allah will suffice you against them, for He both Hearer and Knower.
(We take our) dye of Allah (Our Religion is the Baptism of Allah)! And who is better than Allah at dyeing? And we are worshippers of Him.
Say, "Do you dispute with us concerning Allah, and He is our Lord and your Lord? You have your works and we have ours, and unto Him alone are we sincerely loyal."
Do you say that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, "Do you know better than Allah? Ah! Who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony that he has from Allah? But Allah is not unmindful of what you do.
That was a nation that has passed away. Theirs is what they earned, and your s shall be what you have earned; you shall not be questioned as to that which they have done.
The fools among men will say, "What has turned them from their Qiblah (direction, focus, goal), to which they were used?" Say, "Allah's is the East and the West, He guides whom He will unto the Straight Way." 
Thus have We made you a middle (or justly balanced) nation, to be witnesses against men, and that the Apostle may be a witness against you. We have not appointed the Qiblah (direction, focus, goal) which you were used to, save that We might know (test) who follows the Apostle from him who turns upon his heels, although it is a great thing save for those whom Allah does guide. But Allah will not waste your faith, for verily, Allah is to all people full of Kindness, Most Merciful.
We see you often turn your face towards the heavens, but We will surely turn you to a Qiblah you shall like. Turn then your face towards the Sacred Mosque (Kaaba in Mecca); wherever you are, turn your faces towards it; for verily, the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) know well that it is the truth from their Lord; - Allah is not unmindful of that which you do.
And even if you should bring to the People of the Book every sign, they would not follow your Qiblah (direction, focus, goal); and you are not to follow their Qiblah; nor do some of them follow the Qiblah of the others: and if you follow their lusts (vain desires, prejudices, fantasies) after the knowledge that has come to you, then are you of the wrongdoers.
Those whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons, although a sect of them does surely hide the truth which they themselves know.
The truth (is) from your Lord; be not, therefore, one of those who doubt.
Every sect has a huwa (goal) to which Allah turns him; but do you strive onwards together to do good works; wherever you are Allah will bring you all together; verily, Allah has power over all things.
From wherever you come forth, there turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, for it is surely truth from your Lord; Allah is not unmindful about what you do. 
And from wherever you come forth, there turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it, that men may have no argument against you, save only those of them who are bent on wickedness; and fear them not, but fear Me; and I will fulfil My favours to you, perchance you may be guided yet.
Thus (similarly) have We sent amongst you an apostle from yourselves, to recite to you Our signs, to purify you and teach you the Book and wisdom, and to teach you what you did not know; 
Remember Me, then, and I will remember you; thank Me, and do not disbelieve (or reject faith).
O you who do believe! Seek aid from sabr (patience, perseverance, self-restraint and constancy) and from prayer, verily, Allah is with the patient. 
And say not of those who are slain in Allah's Way (the Way of striving, sacrifice and restraint) (that they are) dead. Nay, they are living; but you do not perceive it.  
We will try you with something of fear, and hunger and loss of wealth, and lives and fruits (of toil); but give good tidings to those who patiently persevere 
Who, when there falls on them a calamity say, "Verily, we are Allah's and, verily, to Him is our return." 
These are they on whom are blessings from their Lord and Mercy, and they it is who receive Guidance.
Verily, Zafa and Merwah (mountains near the Kaaba) are of the beacons (symbols) of Allah, and he who makes the pilgrimage unto the House, or visits it at other times, it is no crime for him to compass them both about; and he who obeys his own Impulse to Good - Allah is Responsive, Aware.
Verily, those who hide what We have revealed of manifest Signs and of Guidance after We have manifested it to men in the Book, them Allah shall curse, and those entitled to curse shall curse them too. 
Save those who turn (repent) and make amends and openly declare the truth; these will I turn to again, for I am Oft-Relenting, Most Merciful.
Verily, those who disbelieve (or reject faith) and die while still in disbelief, on them is the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and of all mankind; 
They will dwell therein (in the curse) for ever; the torment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they have any respite.
Your God is one God; there is no God but He, the Compassionate, the Merciful
Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and in the ship that sail the seas with that which profits mankind, and in the rain which Allah sends down from heaven and quickens therewith the earth after its death, and spreads abroad therein all kinds of animals, and in the shifting of the winds, and in the clouds that are pressed into service betwixt heaven and earth, are signs for people who can understand.
Yet are there some amongst mankind who take to themselves (for worship) peers other than Allah; they love them as they should love Allah. But those who have faith are overflowing with love for Allah. O that those who are unjust could only see, they would see the Penalty (or Consequence) that all power belongs to Allah, and He will strongly enforce the Penalty,
When those who are Followed clear themselves of those who Follow them, they would see the Penalty, and the cords between them would be cut asunder.
And those who Follow would say, "Had we but another turn, then would we clear ourselves of them as they have cleared themselves of us." So will Allah show them the fruits of their deeds; for them are regrets, and they shall have no way out of the Fire.
O you folk! Eat of what is in the earth, things lawful and things good, and follow not the footsteps of Satan, verily, to you he is an open foe.
He does but bid you what is evil and shameful, and that you should speak against Allah what you do not know.
When it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say, "Nay, we will follow the way of our fathers." What! Even though their fathers had no sense (or wisdom) at all or guidance?
The likeness of those who disbelieve (or reject faith) is as the likeness of him who shouts like a goat-herd, to that which hears him not, save only a call and a cry; deaf, dumb, and blind they are devoid of understanding.
O you who do believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and give thanks unto Allah if it be Him you serve. 
He has only forbidden for you what is dead, and blood, and flesh of swine, and whatsoever has been consecrated to other than Allah; but he who is forced by necessity, neither revolting nor transgressing, it is no sin for him; for verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving and Most Merciful.
Verily, those who hide what Allah has revealed of the Book, and sell it for a miserable profit, they swallow nothing save fire; and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, but for them is grievous woe.
They are those who sell guidance for error, and pardon for torment, how bold are they of the fire!
That (is), because Allah has revealed the Book with truth, but verily those who seek causes of dispute in the Book are in a schism far (from the goal).
Righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the East or the West, but it is righteousness to believe in Allah, and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers, and to spend of your wealth for love of Him, for your kindred, and orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer, for those who ask, and to ransom those in captivity; and to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the covenant (contracts) which you have made; and to be firm in patience in times of pain (poverty and deprivation), and adversity, and in periods of panic (or violence); these are the people who are true, and these are those who are Allah-fearing.
O you who believe! Retaliation (or the Law of Equivalence) is prescribed for you. In cases of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the female for the female; yet he who is pardoned at all by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand and compensate him with kindness. That is a concession and a mercy from your Lord; and he who transgresses after that for him is grievous woe.
In retaliation (or the law of Equivalence) there is life for you, O you possessors of understanding! That you may ward of evil.
It is prescribed for you that when any of you is facing death, if he leaves any goods, that he makes reasonable bequests to his parents, and to his kinsmen. It is a duty upon all those that are God-fearing.
But he who alters it after that he has heard it, the sin thereof is only upon those who alter it; verily, Allah is Hearer and Knower.
And he who fears from the testator a wrong intention, or a crime, and does make peace between the parties, it is no sin to him; verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who believe! There is prescribed for you the fast as it was prescribed for those before you; per chance (or possibly) you may learn self-restraint. 
(Fasting) A certain number of days, but he amongst you who is ill or on a journey, then (let him fast) another number of days. And those who can do it with hardship may redeem it by feeding a poor man; but he who gives more of his own will, it is better for him; but if you fast it is better for you, if you did but know.
The month of Ramadan, wherein was revealed the Quran as a Guidance to mankind, and as manifest Sign, and as a Discrimination. So he amongst you who is at his home during this month then let him fast through it; but he who is sick or on a journey, then another number of days; - Allah desires for you what is easy (or reasonable), and desires not for you what is difficult, that you may complete the prescribed period, and say, "Great is Allah," (or glorify Him) for that He has guided you; per chance (or possibly) you may give thanks.
When My servants ask you  concerning Me, then, verily, I am near; I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when ever he calls to Me. So let them also, with a will, listen to My call, and let them believe in Me; per chance (or possibly) they may be directed aright.
Lawful for you on the night of the fast is association with your wives; they are a garment unto you, and you a garment unto them. Allah knows that you did defraud yourselves, wherefore He has turned towards you and forgiven you; so now go in unto them and crave what Allah has prescribed (or ordained) for you, and eat and drink until a white thread can be distinguished by you from a black one at the dawn. Then fulfil the fast until the night, and go not in unto them while you are at your devotions in the mosques. These are the bounds that Allah has set, so draw not near thereto. Thus does Allah make manifest His signs to men, that per chance (or possibly) they may learn restraint.
Devour not your wealth among yourselves vainly, nor present it to the judges that you may devour a part of the wealth of other men sinfully and knowingly.
They will ask you about the New Moon; say, "They are indications of time for men and for the pilgrimage." And it is not righteousness that you should enter into your houses from behind them (in superstition), but righteous is he who fears (Allah); so enter into your houses by the proper doors and fear Allah that per chance (or possibly) you may prosper.
Fight in the Cause of Allah with those who fight you, but transgress not the limits (or begin not hostilities); verily, Allah loves not those who transgress (or the aggressors).
Kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drive you out; for persecution (oppression or sedition) is worse than slaughter; but fight them not by the Sacred Mosque unless they fight you there; If they fight you then kill them, for such is the recompense of those that are faithless.
But if they desist, then, verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. 
But fight them until there be no more oppression (persecution or sedition) and that the Din (religion, faith, justice, the attitude and way of life) may be Allah's; but, if they desist, then let there be no hostility save against the unjust oppressors.
The sacred month for the sacred month; for all sacred things demand retaliation (the Law of Equivalence); and whoever transgresses against you, transgress against him likewise as he transgressed against you; but fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who practice restraint.
Expend in alms in the cause of Allah and be not cast by your own hands into perdition; but do good, for Allah loves those who do good.
And fulfil the pilgrimage and the visitation to Allah; but if you be prevented (or besieged), then what is easiest for you by way of gift. But shave not your heads until your gift shall reach its destination; and he amongst you who is sick or has a hurt upon his head, then the redemption is by fasting or by alms or by an offering. But when you are safe again, then let him who would enjoy the visitation until the pilgrimage what is easiest (what he can afford) as a gift. And he who cannot afford it, then let him fast three days on the pilgrimage and seven when you return; these make ten days complete. That is, for him whose family are not present in the Sacred Mosque; and fear Allah and know that Allah is strict in punishment.
The pilgrimage is (in) well-known months: whoever then makes it incumbent on himself (let him have neither) commerce with women, nor fornication, nor a quarrel on the pilgrimage; and whatsoever of good you do, Allah knows it; then provide yourself for your journey; but the best provision is piety. Fear you Me you who possess understanding.
It is no crime to you that you seek the bounty of your Lord; but when you pour forth from Arafat, remember Allah by the Sacred Monument. Remember Him how He guided you, although you were, before this, surely of those who are in error.
Then quickly pass you forth from whence it is usual for multitudes to pour forth and ask pardon of Allah; verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And when you have performed your rites, remember Allah as you remember your fathers, or with a keener memory still. There is among men such as says, "Our Lord! Give us in this world;" but then they have no portion in the Hereafter.
And some there be who say, "Our Lord! Give us in this world good and good in the Hereafter; and defend us from the torment of the fire!"
These have their portion from what they have earned; for Allah is swift at reckoning.
Remember Allah through the appointed days; but whoever hastens off in two days, it is no sin to him, and he who lingers on it is no sin to him, for him who fears. So fear you Allah and know that unto Him shall you be gathered.
There is among men a type whose speech about the life of this world pleases you, and he calls on Allah to witness what is in his heart; yet is he most fierce in opposition unto you. 
And when he turns away, he strives upon the earth to do evil therein, and to destroy the tilth and the stock; verily, Allah loves not evil doing. 
And when it is said to him, "Fear Allah," then pride leads him to sin; but hell is enough for him! Surely an evil bed is that.
And there is among men a type who sells his soul, craving, those things that are pleasing unto Allah, and Allah is kind unto His servants.
O you who believe! Come, one and all (or wholeheartedly), into surrender (Islam), and follow not the footsteps of Satan; verily, to you he is an open enemy. 
And if you slip after the manifest signs have come to you, then know that Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.
Do they expect that Allah should come unto them in the shadow of a cloud with angels? (Would this settle the question? Or is this the excuse?) But then their case would have been judged already. Unto Allah do all cases return.
Ask the children of Israel how many a manifest sign We gave to them; and whoever alters Allah's favours after that they have come to him, then Allah is strict at following up.
Beautiful is the life of this world to those who disbelieve; they jest at those who do believe. But those who keep their duty shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah gives provision unto whom He will without measure.
Mankind were one nation once, and Allah sent them prophets with good tidings and with warnings, and sent down with them the Book in truth, to judge between men in that wherein they disagreed; but only those unto whom the scripture was given disagreed therein after manifest signs had come to them, through selfishness and stubborn pride (or hatred) amongst themselves; and Allah guided by His Will the believers to the truth concerning that wherein they disagreed, for Allah guides whom He will unto the straight path.
Did you count on entering Paradise, while there had nothing come to you like that which came to those who passed away before you; they encountered affliction and adversity, and they were made to quake, until the Messenger and those who believed with him said, "When (comes) Allah's help? Surely, Allah's help is nigh?"
They will ask you what they are to expend in alms: say, "Whatsoever good you expend it should be for parents and kinsmen, and the orphan and the poor, and the son of the road (wayfarers); and whatsoever good you do, verily, of it Allah is Aware."
Prescribed for you is Warfare, though it is hateful to you. But it is possible that you hate a thing while it is good for you, and it is possible that you love a thing while it is bad for you; Allah knows, and ye, you do not!
They will ask you about warfare in the Sacred Month. Say, "Fighting therein is a great sin; but turning people away from Allah's way, and disbelief in Him and in the Sacred Mosque, and to expel His people out there from, is a greater sin in the sight of Allah; and persecution is a greater sin than slaughter." They will not cease from fighting you until they turn you from your religion if they can; but whoever of you is turned from his religion and dies while still a disbeliever; these are those whose works are vain in this life and the Hereafter; they are the Fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein.
Verily, those who believe, and those who flee, and those who fight (strive and struggle) in Allah's way; these may hope for Allah's mercy, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
They will ask you about wine and el maisar (getting something too easily, i.e. gambling, usury etc.), say, "In them both is great sin and some profit to men; but the sin of both is greater than the profit of the same." They will ask you what they shall expend in alms: Say: "The surplus (what is beyond need)." Thus does Allah manifest to you His signs; per chance (or possibly) you may reflect 
Upon this life and the Hereafter! They will ask you about orphans: say, "It is best to do what improves their lot." But if you mingle their affairs with your s - they are your brethren, and Allah knows him who means mischief from him who means well; and if Allah wills He could surely put you into trouble. Verily, Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Wed not with idolatrous women until they believe, for surely a believing handmaid is better than an idolatrous woman, even though she please you. And wed not (your girls) to idolatrous men until they believe, for a believing slave is better than an idolater, even though he please you. These invite you to the fire, but Allah invites you to paradise and to pardon by His Grace, and makes clear His signs to mankind; per chance (or possibly) they may remember.
They will ask you about menstruation: say, "It is a hurt and a pollution." So keep apart from women at such times, and go not near them till they are cleansed; but when they have purified themselves you may come in to them as Allah has ordered you. Verily, Allah loves those who turn to Him, and those who keep themselves clean.
Your women are your tilth (to cultivate), so come into your tillage how you choose; but do a previous good act for yourselves, and fear Allah, and know that you are going to meet Him; and give good tidings unto those who do believe.
Make not Allah an excuse in your oaths against doing good and observing your duty to Him, and make peace amongst men, for Allah is both Hearer  and Knower.
He will not call you to account for the unintentional word in your oaths, but He will call you to account for the intentions of your heart; but Allah is Forgiving and Clement.
Those who take an oath of abstention from their wives, they must wait four months; but if they break their vow Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And if they intend to divorce them, verily, remember Allah is Hearer and Knower. 
Divorced women must wait, apart, for three courses; and it is not lawful to them that they hide what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and in the Last Day. Their husbands will do better to take them back in that (case) if they wish for reconciliation; for, the same right is due to them as from them in kindness; but men have a degree of advantage (in strength, position, wealth etc.) over them. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Divorce is permissible only twice (after an intermediate reconciliation); then keep them in honour, or let them go with kindness. It is not lawful for you to take from them anything of what you have given them, unless both fear that they cannot keep within Allah's bounds. So if you fear that you cannot keep within Allah's bounds there is no crime in you both if she ransoms herself. These are Allah's bounds. Do not transgress them; and whoever transgresses Allah's bounds, they it is who are unjust.
But if he divorce her (a third time) she shall not be lawful to him after that, until she marry another husband; but, if he divorce her too, it is no crime in them both to come together again, if they think that they can keep within Allah's bounds. These are Allah's bounds which He explains to a people who have knowledge.
When you divorce women, and they have reached the prescribed time, then keep them in kindness (or equity), or release them in kindness (or equity). but do not keep them by force to transgress; for whoever does that, he is unjust to his own soul: and do not make the revelations of Allah into a jest; but remember Allah's favours to you, and what He has sent down to you in the Book and Wisdom, to admonish you thereby; and observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is Aware of all things.
When you divorce women, and they have reached their prescribed term, do not put difficulties in their marrying their husbands, if it is agreed between them in kindness (or equity). This instruction is for all amongst you who believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is more pure for you and cleaner. But Allah knows, and you know not.
Mothers shall suckle their children two whole years for those who wish to complete the time of suckling; the duty for feeding and clothing nursing mothers in adequate manner is upon the father of the child; but no soul shall be obliged beyond its capacity. A mother shall not be made to suffer because of her child; nor should he to whom the child is born (the father). And the same (is incumbent) on the heir (of the father). But if both parties wish to wean, by mutual consent and counsel, then it is no crime in them. And if you wish to provide a wet-nurse for your children, it is no crime in you provided you pay what you have promised her, in reason. Fear Allah, and know that Allah is Seer of what you do.
Those of you who die and leave wives behind, let these wait by themselves for four months and ten days; and when they have reached their prescribed time, there is no crime in them for what they do with themselves in reason; for Allah is well informed of what you do.
Nor is there any crime in you if you make them an offer of marriage, or that you keep it secret in your minds. Allah knows that you will remember them; but do not make a secret contract with them except in honourable terms (or use a recognised form of words and procedures); and resolve not on the marriage tie until the prescribed times are fulfiled. Know that Allah is Forgiving and Clement.
It is no crime in you if you divorce your women ere you have yet touched them, or settled for them a settlement. But provide fair maintenance for them; the wealthy according to his power, and the straitened according to his power - a duty this upon the virtuous.
And if you divorce them before you have touched them, but have already settled for them a settlement; then pay half of what you have settled, unless they (the women) agree to remit it, or he in whose hand is the marriage tie (the husband) remits it (his half, and therefore, pays the whole); and that you should remit it is nearer to righteousness; and forget not liberality between you. Verily, Allah is Seer of what you do.
Observe prayers, especially the middle (afternoon) prayer, and stand you before Allah with full attention and devotion.
And if you stand in danger, then pray afoot or on horseback; but when you are in safety remember Allah, how He taught you what yet you knew not.
Those of you who die and leave wives, should bequeath to their wives maintenance for a year, without expulsion (from their home); but if they go out of their accord, there is no crime in you for what they do of their own rights. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
And divorced women should have a maintenance in reason, - a duty this on those that fear. 
Thus does Allah explain to you His revelations so that you may understand.
Do you not look at those who left their homes by thousands, for fear of death; and Allah said to them "Die," and then He quickened them again? Verily Allah is Lord of Grace to men, but most men give no thanks.
Fight then in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is both Hearer and Knower.
Who is there that will lend to Allah a goodly loan? He will increase it many times; Allah closes His hand and holds it out (i.e. He gives want or plenty), and unto Him shall you return.
Do you not look at the chiefs of the children of Israel after Moses' time, when they said to a prophet of theirs (Samuel), "Raise up for us a king, and we will fight in Allah's way?" He said, "Will you perhaps, if it be prescribed for you to fight, refuse to fight?" They said, "Why should we not fight in Allah's way, now that we are dispossessed of our homes and children?" But when it was prescribed for them to fight they turned back, save a few of them. Allah is Aware of evildoers.
Then their prophet said to them, "Verily, Allah has raised up for you Talut (Saul) as a king;" they said, How can the kingdom be his over us; we have more right to the kingdom than he, for he has not an amplitude of wealth?" He said, "Verily, Allah has chosen him over you, and has provided him with an abundance of knowledge and stature. Allah gives the kingdom unto whom He will; Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
Then said to them their prophet, "The sign of his kingdom is that there shall come to you the Ark with the shechina (peace, security and reassurance) in it from your Lord, and the relics of what the family of Moses and the family of Aaron left; the angels shall bear it." In that is surely a sign to you if you have faith.
And when Saul set out with his army, he said, "Behold, Allah will try you with a river, and he who drinks there from, he is not of mine; but whoever tastes it not, he is of mine, save he who sips it with his hand." But they drank from it save a few of them, and when he crossed the river, he and those who believed with him, they said, "We have no power this day against Goliath and his army," But those who thought that they would meet their Lord said, "How many times has a small division of men vanquished a numerous one, by Allah's permission. For Allah is with the steadfast."
And when they went out against a Goliath and his forces, they prayed saying, "Lord, pour out on us endurance, make firm our steps, and help us against the faithless!"
And they routed them by the permission of Allah, and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of what He willed. And were it not that Allah repelled some men by means of others the earth would become corrupted; but Allah is Lord of Bounty over all the worlds.
These are the signs of Allah, which We recite unto you in truth, for, verily, you are of those who are sent (Our Messengers).
Of these Messengers, We preferred some above others. Of them are some to whom Allah spoke; and We have exalted some of them by degrees; and We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, manifest signs, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. And, if Allah had willed, those who came after them would not have fought one another, after the clear proof had come to them. But they disagreed, some believing and others disbelieving. And, if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another; but Allah does what He will.
O you who believe! Expend in alms of what We have bestowed upon you, before the day comes in which is no barter, and no friendship, and no intercession. The faithless, they are the miscreants.
Allah, there is no God but He, the Living, the Eternal. Slumber takes Him not, nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Who is it that intercedes with Him save by His permission? He knows what is before them and what behind them, and they comprehend nothing of His Knowledge but of what He pleases. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and it tires Him not to preserve them both, for He is Sublime, the Grand.
There is no compulsion in religion; the right way is henceforth distinct from the wrong. And whoever rejects Taghut (false deities) and believes in Allah, he has grasped a firm handle which will not break; but Allah is both Hearer and Knower.
Allah is the patron of those who believe, He brings them forth from darkness into light. But those who disbelieve, their patrons are false deities; these bring them forth from light to darkness. Such are fellows of the Fire, they will dwell therein.
Have you not seen him who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, that Allah had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said, "My Lord is He who gives life and death," he said, "I give life and death." Abraham said, "But verily, Allah brings the sun from the east, do you then bring it from the west?" Thus was the disbeliever abashed. Allah does not guide unjust folk.
Or the like of him who passed by a town, when it was desolate and in ruins, and said, "How will Allah revive this after its death?" And Allah made him die for a hundred years, and then He raised him, and said, "How long have you tarried?" Said he, "I have tarried a day, or some part of a day." He said, "Nay, you have tarried a hundred years; look at your food and drink, they have rotted, and look at your ass; for We will make you a sign to men. And look at the bones how We scatter them and then clothe them with flesh." And when it was made manifest to him, he said, "I know now that Allah is Able to do all things."
And when Abraham said, "Lord, show me how you will revive the dead," He said, "What, do you not yet believe?" Said he, "Yea, but that my heart may be quieted." He said, "Then take four birds, and take them close to yourself (tame them or make them love you); then put some of them on every hill; then call them, and they will come to you in haste; and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise."
The likeness of those who expend their wealth in Allah's way is as the likeness of a grain that grows to seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains, for Allah will give many fold unto whom He pleases; for Allah is All-Embracing and All-Knowing.
Those who expend their wealth in Allah's way, then do not follow it up by taunting and by annoyance, these have their reward with their Lord, and no fear is on them, neither shall they grieve.
Kind speech and pardon are better than almsgiving followed by injury. Allah is Absolute and Clement.
O you who believe! Make not your almsgiving vain by reproach (or reminders of your generosity) and injury, like him who expends what he has for the sake of appearances before men, and believes not in Allah and the Last Day; for his likeness is as the likeness of a flint with soil upon it, and a heavy shower falls on it and leaves it bare rock; they can do naught with what they earn, for Allah guides not the misbelieving folk.
But the likeness of those who expend their wealth craving the goodwill of Allah, and to strengthen their souls, are as the likeness of a fertile garden on a hill. A heavy shower falls on it, and it brings forth its yield twofold; and if no heavy shower falls on it, the dew does; Allah is Seer of all you do.
Would one of you like to have a garden of date-palms and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it, in which is every fruit; and when old age comes to him and he has weak children, that it should be stricken by a storm wind with fire therein, and burnt up? Thus does Allah manifest to you His signs, per chance (or possibly) you will reflect.
O you who believe! Spend of the good things that you have earned, and of what We have brought forth for you out of the earth, and do not take the vile (or worst) thereof to spend in alms, that you would not take for yourselves save with closed eyes (or disdain); but know that Allah is Absolute, the Praise-worthy.
The devil promises you destitution and bids you sin, but Allah promises you pardon from Him and grace, for Allah is both All-Embracing and All-Knowing. 
He brings wisdom unto whom He will, and he who is brought wisdom is brought much good; but none will remember save those endowed with understanding.
Whatever alms you expend, or vow you swear, Allah knows it; but the unjust have no helpers. 
If you display your almsgiving, then it is well ; but if you hide it and bring it to the poor, then is it better for you, and will atone for you some of your evil deeds; for Allah is Informed of what you do.
It is not your duty (O Muhammad) to guide them; but Allah guides whom He will; and whatever good you expend it is for yourselves when you spend not save for Allah's sake. And what you spend of good, it shall be repaid you in full, and you shall not be wronged,
(Alms are for) the poor who are straitened in Allah's way, and cannot travel about in the earth. The ignorant think them to be rich because of their modesty; you will know them by their mark, they do not beg from men with importunity; but what you spend of good Allah knows.
Those who expend their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly, they shall have their reward with their Lord. No fear shall come on them, nor shall they grieve.
Those who devour usury shall not rise again, save as he rises whom Satan hath paralyzed with a touch; and that is because they say "trade is only like usury," but Allah has made selling (or trade) lawful and usury unlawful; and he to whom the admonition from his Lord has come, if he desists, he can keep his past gains: his matter is in Allah's hands. But whoever returns (to usury) these are the Fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein. 
Allah has cursed usury, but made charity fruitful, for Allah loves not the ungrateful and faithless.
Verily, those who believe, and act righteously, and are steadfast in prayer, and pay the poor due, their reward is with their Lord; there shall no fear come on them, nor shall they grieve.
O you who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and remit the balance of usury, if you be, in truth, believers; 
And if you will not do it, then hearken to the proclamation of war from Allah and His Apostle; but if you repent, your capital is your s. Wrong not, and you shall not be wronged.
And if a debtor be in difficulties, then wait for easier circumstances; but to remit the debt as alms is better for you, if you did but know.
Guard yourselves against the day when you shall return to Allah; then shall each soul be paid what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
O you who believe! If you contract a debt for a stated time, then write it down, and let a scribe faithfully record it in writing between you in equity; nor let a scribe refuse to write as Allah taught him, but let him write, and let him who owes dictate; but let him fear Allah his Lord, and diminish nothing there from; but if he who owes be of low understanding, or weak, or cannot dictate himself, then let the guardian of his interests (or agent) dictate faithfully in justice. And call two witnesses out from amongst their men; or if two men not be at hand, then a man and two women, from those whom he approves as witnesses, so that if one of the two should err, the second of the two may remind the other. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are summoned; and let them not tire of writing it, be it small or great, with the terms of payment. That is more just in the sight of Allah, and more upright for testimony, and brings you nearer to avoiding doubt. Unless, indeed, it be actual merchandise (or ready-money) which you transfer between you hand to hand. In that case it is no sin against you that you do not write it down; but bring witnesses to what you sell one to another, and let not either scribe or witness come to harm; for if you do, it will be an abomination in you. Observe your duty to Allah, for Allah is teaching you, and Allah is Knower of all things. 
But if you are upon a journey, and you cannot find a scribe, then let a pledge be taken. But if one of you trust another, then let him who is trusted surrender his trust, and let him fear Allah his Lord, and conceal not testimony, for he who conceals it, verily, sinful is his heart: Allah is Aware of what you do.
Allah's is what is in heaven and in the earth, and if you show what is in your souls, or hide it, Allah will call you to account; and He forgives whom He will, and punishes whom He will, for Allah is Able to do all things.
The Messenger believes in what is sent down to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. Each believes in Allah, and His angels, and His Scriptures, and His Messengers, - We make no distinction between any of His Messengers - and they say, "We hear and we obey, Thy pardon, O Lord! For to Unto Thee is our journeying." 
Allah will not require of the soul beyond its capacity. It shall have what it has earned, and it shall owe what it deserves. "Our Lord, condemn us not, if we forget or miss the mark; Our Lord, load us not with a burden as Thou hast loaded those before us. Our Lord, impose not on us what we have not strength to bear, but forgive us, absolve us, and have mercy on us. Thou art our Sovereign, then give us victory against the faithless!"
ALIF LAM MIM. 
Allah, there is no God but He, the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal. 
It is He who has sent down to you  the Scripture with truth, confirming what was revealed before it, and has revealed the Torah and the Gospel before this for the guidance of mankind, and has revealed the Discrimination (Criterion). 
Verily, those who disbelieve in the signs of Allah, for them is a severe penalty, for Allah is Mighty and Avenging.
Verily, from Allah, there is nothing hidden in the earth, nor in heaven; 
He it is who fashions you in the womb as He pleases. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Wise.
He it is who has revealed to you the Book, in which there are some verses that are Basic (decisive, or of established meaning) they are the mother (foundation) of the Book; and others are allegorical. But as for those in whose heart is perversity, they follow what is allegorical seeking discord, craving for (their own) interpretation of it; but none know the interpretation of it except Allah. And those who are well grounded in knowledge say, "We believe in it; it is all from our Lord"; but none will grasp the message save those who possess understanding. (Or: but none know the interpretation of it except Allah and those who are well grounded in knowledge. Say: "We believe in it, it is all from our Lord, but none will grasp the message save those who possess understanding.)
 3:8 "O Lord! Pervert not our heart after Thou hast guided us, and grant us mercy from Thee, for Thou, only Thou art the Bestower (the Giver of Bounties). 
O Lord! It is Thou Who gathers together mankind unto the Day wherein is no doubt. Verily, Allah will not depart from His promise."
Verily, their wealth shall not help the faithless, nor their children, against Allah at all; they will be fuel for the fire.
As was the case with Pharaoh's people and their predecessors: they said Our signs were lies, and Allah seized them for their sins, for Allah is severe in punishment.
Say to those who disbelieve, "Soon you shall be overcome and driven together to Hell, an evil bed will it be.
"You already have had a sign in the two parties who met (at the battle of Badr); one party fighting in the way of Allah, the other disbelieving; these saw, with their very eyes, twice the number as themselves. Thus Allah strengthens with His help those whom He pleases." Verily, in that is a lesson for those who have perception. 
Beautiful unto men is the life of lust for women, and children, and heaps of hoarded gold and silver, and of horses well bred, and cattle, and well tilled land; these are the comforts for the life of this world; but Allah, with Him is the more excellent resort.
Say, "But shall we tell you of a better thing than this?" For the righteous are Gardens with their Lord, beneath which rivers flow; they shall dwell therein for ever, and pure companions and grace from Allah; for all His servants are in Allah's sight.
Those who say, "Lord, we do, indeed, believe. Forgive you our sins and keep us from the torment of the fire," 
Those who show patient, firmness and self-control, the truthful in word and deed, the devout in worship, and those who spend, and pray for forgiveness at dawn.
Allah, Himself, bears witness that there is no God but He, and so do the angels, and those possessed of knowledge, maintaining His creation in justice. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Wise.
Verily, (the true) religion in Allah's sight is The Surrender (to His will, i.e. Islam), and those to whom the Book was given formerly disagreed not until after knowledge came to them, through mutual envy. But whoever disbelieves in Allah's revelations, (find that) truly Allah is quick at reckoning.
And if they dispute with you, then say, "I have surrendered my whole self unto Allah, and so have those who follows me." And say to those who have been given the Book, and unto the unlearned (or unread or Gentiles), "Have ye, too, surrendered" and if they surrender, then are they truly guided. But if they turn their backs, then your duty is only to convey the message unto them. Allah is Seer of His servants.
Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah's revelations, and kill the prophets wrongfully, and kill those from among mankind who bid what is just, promise them a grievous woe! 
These are they whose works are void in this world and the Hereafter, and they have no helpers.
Did you not see those who have been given a portion of the Book? They called on the Book of Allah to decide disputes between them; and then a sect of them turned their backs and opposes it;
That is because they say, "The fire shall not touch us save for a certain number of days." But that which they had invented in their religion deceived them. 
How will it be when we have gathered them together on a Day whereof there is no doubt, when each soul shall be paid what it has earned in full, and they shall not be wronged?
Say, "O Allah, Lord of the Kingdom! Thou givestst the kingdom (or power and authority) to whomsoever Thou pleases, and withdraws the kingdom (or power and authority) from whomsoever Thou pleases; Thou honours whom Thou pleases, and abases whom Thou pleases; in Thy hand is good. Verily, Thou art mighty over all things. 
Thou dost turn night to day, and do turn day to night, and do bring forth the living from the dead, and Thou brings forth the dead from the living. Thou dost give sustenance for whom Thou chooses without stint."
Let not those who believe take disbelievers for their friends rather than believers. He who does this has no part with Allah at all, unless, indeed, you guard yourselves against them. But Allah bids you beware of only Himself, for unto Allah is your journeying.
Say, "If you hide that which is in your breasts, or if you show it, Allah knows it: He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, for Allah is Able to do all things."
On the day when every soul shall find itself presented with what it has done of good and what it has done of evil, then it will long that there were between itself and that evil a wide distance. Allah bids you beware of Himself, but Allah is gentle with His servants.
Say, "If you love Allah then follow me, and Allah will love you and forgive you your sins, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
Say, "Obey Allah and the Messenger"; but if they turn away Allah loves not disbelievers."
Verily, Allah has preferred Adam, and Noah, and Abraham's family, and Imran's family above all people, 
Offsprings one of the other. Allah Hears and Knows all things.
When Imran's wife said, "Lord! I have vowed to dedicate unto Thee  what is within my womb. Accept it then from me. Verily, you are Hearer and Knower." 
And when she brought it forth she said, "Verily, I have brought forth a female" - Allah knew best what she brought forth; and a male is not like a female - "I have called her Mary, and I seek a refuge in Thee  for her and for her seed from Satan the outcast."
And her Lord accepted fully, and gave her a goodly growth, and assigned her to Zachariah's care. Whenever Zachariah entered her chamber he found beside her a provision, and he said, "O Mary, whence comes this to you?" She answered, "It is from Allah, for Allah provides without stint for whom He pleases."
Therefore prayed Zachariah to his Lord, and said, "Lord, grant me from Thee good seed. Verily, Thou hears prayer." 
And an angel called out to him as he was standing praying in the chamber (and said) "Allah gives you the glad tidings of John, to confirm the Word from Allah, a noble and a chaste one, and a prophet of the righteous."
He said, "My Lord, how can there be to me a boy when old age has reached me, and my wife is barren?" The angel answered, "Thus Allah does what He pleases." 
He said, "My Lord, make for me a sign." The angel said, "The sign unto you is that you shall not speak to men for three days, save by gesture; but remember your Lord much, and celebrate His praises in the evening and the morning."
And when the angels said, "O Mary! Verily, Allah has chosen you, and has purified you, and has chosen you above the women of the world. 
O Mary! Be obedient unto your Lord, and adore and bow down with those who bow.” 
This is (one) of the declarations of the unseen world which we reveal to you  (Muhammad), though you were not by them when they threw their lots as to which of them should take care of Mary, nor were you by them when they did dispute.
When the angel said, "O Mary! Verily, Allah gives you the glad tidings of a Word from Him; his name shall be the Messiah Jesus, the son of Mary, honoured in this world and the Hereafter and of those whose place is nigh to Allah. 
And he shall speak to people in his cradle and in his manhood, and shall be among the righteous." 
She said, "Lord! How can I have a son, when man has not yet touched me?" He said, "Thus Allah creates what He pleases. When He decrees a matter He only says: BE! And it is; 
And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel, 
And he shall be a Messenger to the people of Israel (saying), "Verily, I have come to you, with a sign from Allah, namely, that I will create for you out of clay a form of a bird, and I will blow thereon and it shall become a bird by Allah's permission; and I will heal those blind from birth, and lepers; and I will raise the dead to life by Allah's permission; and I will tell you what you eat and what you store up in your houses. Verily, in these are signs for you if you have faith.
And I come confirming what was before you of the Torah, and to make lawful for you some of that which was forbidden unto you. I come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and follow me, 
Allah is my Lord, and your Lord, so worship Him: - this is the straight path."
And when Jesus perceived their unbelief, He said, "Who will be my helpers in the cause of Allah?" The disciples said, "We will be Allah's helpers. We believe in Allah, so bear you witness that we have surrendered (unto Him). 
Lord, we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow him whom Thou hast sent, so write us down with those who bear witness." 
But they (the Jews or unbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed, for Allah is the best of schemers!
Behold! Allah said, "O Jesus! I will take you and raise you up to Myself, and will cleanse you (of the falsehoods) of those who disbelieve, and will set those who follow you above the faithless until the Day of Resurrection. Then unto Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that wherein you used to disagree.
And as for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with grievous punishment in this world and the next, and they shall have none to help them." 
But as for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages in full, for Allah loves not the wrongdoers (or unjust).
This which We recite unto you is of the Signs (revelations) and of the Wise Reminder (the Message of Wisdom, the Quran). 
Verily the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created him from earth, then He said to him: BE! And he was;
This is the truth from your Lord, so be you not of those who are in doubt. 
And whoever disputes with you after what has come to you of knowledge, say, "Come, let us call our sons and your sons, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves: then we will earnestly pray and invoke Allah's curse on those who lie."
Verily, those are the true stories, and there is no God but Allah, and, verily, Allah He is the Mighty, the Wise; 
But if they turn away, Allah is Aware of the evildoers (corrupters, mischief-makers).
Say, "O you people of the Book, come to an agreement between us and you, that we will not serve other than Allah, nor associate aught with him, nor take others for Lords rather than Allah." But if they turn away then say, "Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered."
O people of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? What! Do you not understand? 
Here you are, disputing about what you have some knowledge of; why then do you dispute about what you have no knowledge? Allah knows and you know not.
Abraham was not a Jew, nor yet a Christian, but he was a "Hanif" (an upright man) who had surrendered, and not of the idolaters. 
Verily, the people who have most claim to (or are nearest of kin to) Abraham are those who follow him, and this prophet, and those who believe: - Allah is the patron of the believers.
A sect of the people of the Book long to lead you astray, but they only lead themselves astray, and they perceive not.
O people of the Book! Why disbelieve you the revelations of Allah, when you yourselves witness them? 
O people of the Book! Why do you clothe the truth with falsehood and knowingly hide the truth? 
A sect of the people of the Book say, "Believe in what was revealed to those who believed at the first appearance of the day, and disbelieve it at the end thereof" - that (others) may perchance go back (from their faith).
"Do not believe save one who follows your religion." Say (unto them), "Verily, the (true) guidance is the guidance of Allah (alone), that any one should be given like what you are given." Or would they dispute with you before your Lord. Say, "The Bounty is in the hand of Allah, He gives it to whom he pleases, for Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing. 
He especially selects for His mercy whom he pleases, for Allah is Lord of Unbounded Grace.
And among the people of the Book, there are some who, if you entrust them with a hoard of gold, will readily return it to you; and others among them, if you entrust them with a single coin, will not return it unless you keep standing over them. That is because they say, "We owe no duty to the Gentiles;" but they tell a lie against Allah, knowingly.
Nay, whoever fulfils his covenant and acts righteously, - verily, Allah loves those who act righteously. 
Verily, those who sell Allah's covenant and their oaths for a small price, these have no portion in the Hereafter. Allah will not speak to them, and will not look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow (spiritually); but theirs is grievous woe.
And, verily, amongst them is a sect who twist the Scriptures with their tongues, that you may suppose it to be from the Book, but it is not from the Book. They say, "It is from Allah," but it is not from Allah, and they tell a lie against Allah knowingly.
It is not possible for a man to whom Allah has given the Scripture and the Wisdom and the Prophethood, that then he should say to men, "Be you servants of mine rather than of Allah;" but (what he said was) "Be you rather faithful servants of the Lord in teaching the Scripture of what you learn.”
He does not command you to take the angels and the prophets for your Lords; would He bid you faithlessness after you have surrendered?
When Allah made the covenant with the prophets, (He said) "Behold, what I have given you of the Book and Wisdom. Then shall come to you a Messenger confirming that which you possess. You shall believe in him and help him." And He said, "Are you resolved and do you take this covenant as binding on you?" They said, "We are resolved." And He said, "Then bear witness, for I am witness with you;
But they who turns back after this, these are the miscreants."
Seek they other than Allah's religion? When to Him surrenders whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and unto Him shall they return!
Say, "We believe in Allah, and what has been revealed to you , and what was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and what was given to Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord, - we make no distinction between any of them, - and unto Him have we surrendered. 
Whoever craves a religion other than the Surrender (Islam), it shall surely not be accepted from him, and he shall be a loser in the Hereafter."
How shall Allah guide people who have disbelieved after believing and bearing witness that the Apostle is true, and after there come to them manifest signs? Allah guides not the unjust folk.
As for such their reward is that on them is the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and of all mankind (collectively);
They shall dwell therein - the torment shall not be lightened from them, nor shall they have respite;
Save those who repent after that, and do right (or make amends), for verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Verily, those who disbelieve after believing, and then increase in disbelief, their repentance shall not be accepted; these are those who are astray.
Verily, those who disbelieve (or reject faith) and die in disbelief, there shall not be accepted from any one of them the earth-full of gold, though he should give it as a ransom. For them is grievous woe, and no helpers have they.
You cannot attain to righteousness until you spend freely of what you love. But what you spend, of that Allah is aware.
All food was lawful to the children of Israel save what Israel made unlawful to itself before the Torah was revealed. Say, "Bring the Torah and recite it, if you speak the truth." 
But whoever invents against Allah a lie, after that, they are, indeed, the wrong-doers. 
Say, "Allah speaks the truth, then follow the faith of Abraham, a "Hanif" (an upright or righteous man), who was not of the idolaters."
Verily, the first House founded for men was surely that at Bekkah (Mecca), a blessed place and a guidance to the worlds. 
Therein are manifest signs - Abraham's station, and whoever enters it is safe. It is a duty to Allah for man to make the pilgrimage unto the House, for whoever can find his way there (or can afford it). But whoever disbelieves - Allah is Independent (not needful) of all creatures (or worlds).
Say, "O people of the Book! Why do you disbelieve in Allah's revelations, when Allah is witness of what you do?"
Say, "O people of the Book! Why do you turn from the way of Allah him who believes, craving to make it crooked, when you are yourselves witnesses (of Allah's covenant)? But Allah is not unmindful of what you do."
O you who believe! If you obey the sect of those to whom the Book was brought, they will turn you from believers to unbelievers again. 
How can you disbelieve while unto you are recited the revelations of Allah, and among you is His Messenger? But whoever takes tight hold on Allah, he is guided into the Straight Way.
O you who believe! Observe your duty to (or fear or respect) Allah with the right observance (or with the fear or respect that He deserves), and die not save as those who have surrendered (in a state of Islam).
Hold fast, all together, to the cable of Allah, and do not separate (divide or part in sects); but remember the favours of Allah towards you, when you were enemies and He made friendship between your heart, and on the morrow you became brothers, by His grace. You were on the edge of an abyss of fire, but He rescued you there from. Thus does Allah show to you His revelations; perchance you may be guided;
And that there may spring from you a nation who invite to goodness, and bid right conduct, and forbid what is wrong (or indecent); these are the successful.
Be not like those who parted in sects and disagreed after there came to them manifest signs; for them is mighty woe.
On the day when faces shall be whitened and faces shall be blackened. As for those whose faces are blackened, - "Did you disbelieve after your faith, then taste the torment for your disbelief.”
But as for those whose faces are whitened, in Allah's mercy they shall dwell forever.
These are the revelations of Allah. We recite them to you in truth, for Allah desires not injustice unto the worlds (or His creatures).
Allah's is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and unto Allah do all affairs return.
You were the best of nations brought forth unto man. You bid what is reasonable, and forbid what is inappropriate (indecent, wrong), believing in Allah. Had the people of the Book believed, it would have been better for them. There are believers among them, though most of them are sinners.
They shall surely not harm you save a trifle; and if they fight you, they shall show you their backs (flee), then they shall not be helped.
They are smitten with abasement wherever they be found, save for the rope of Allah and the rope of man (the ties of the covenant); and they draw on themselves wrath from Allah and are smitten with wretchedness; that is because they did disbelieve in Allah's signs, and killed the prophets wrongfully. That is because they did rebel and transgress. 
They are not all alike. Of the people of the Book there is an upright community, reciting the revelations of Allah throughout the night, falling prostrate (in Surrender). 
They believe in Allah, and in the last day, and bid intelligent (or right) conduct, and forbid what is stupid (or wrong), and vie with one another in good works; these are among the righteous.
What good they do, surely Allah will not deny its merit, for Allah is Aware of those who fear (or repel) evil.
Verily, those who disbelieve, their wealth and children are of no service to them against Allah; they are the rightful owners of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein.
The likeness of what they spend in this life of the world is as the likeness of wind wherein is a cold blast that falls upon the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys it. It is not Allah who wrongs them, but it is themselves they wrong.
O you who believe! Take not for intimates others than your own folk, who would not fail to ruin you; they love to obstruct you. Hatred is shown by their mouths; but what their breasts conceal is greater still. We have made manifest to you Our revelations, did you but understand.
Verily, it is you who love them, but they love not you; and you believe in the whole of the Scripture. But when they meet you they say, "We believe;" and when they go aside they bite their fingertips at you through rage. Say, "Die in your rage, for Allah does know what is in your heart."
If good luck touches you it is bad for them, but if bad luck befalls you they rejoice therein; yet if you are patient and fear, their tricks shall not harm you. Lo, Allah is surrounding what they do.
When you did set forth early from your household to settle for the believers the positions for battle, Allah was Hearer and Knower.
When two companies of you almost fell away in cowardice but Allah was their Guardian (or Protecting Friend), for on Allah surely do believers put their trust. 
Allah gave you victory at Badr when you were in a contemptible force; so do your duty to Allah in thankfulness. 
When you did say unto the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord supports you with three thousand of the angels sent down from on high?
Yea, if you persevere and avoid evil, and the enemy attacks you suddenly, your Lord will assist you with five thousand of His angels with force. 
Allah ordained this only as glad tidings to comfort your heart withal, for victory comes but from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise - 
That He may cut off some of the faithless, or overwhelm them that they may retire frustrated (from their purpose).
It (the concern, responsibility or decision) is not for you whether He turns towards them again or punish them; for, verily, they are evil-doers.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and in the earth. He forgives whom He will, and punishes whom He will. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who believe! Devour not usury doubling and redoubling, but do your duty to Allah that you may be successful.
Avoid the fire which is prepared for the faithless, 
And obey Allah and His Messenger, that you may get mercy. 
And vie with one another for pardon from your Lord, and for Paradise, the breadth of which is as the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who fear (or avoid) evil.
Those who give charity, both in prosperity and in adversity, for those who control their rage, and those who are forgiving towards mankind. Allah loves the good. 
Those who when they do an evil, or wrong themselves, remember Allah, and ask forgiveness for their sins - and who forgives sins save Allah alone? - And do not knowingly repeat the wrong they did.
The reward for such is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, dwelling therein for ever - an excellent reward for those who strive.
Systems have passed away before your time. Do travel in the earth, and see what was the consequence of those who denied (the prophets or Allah’s guidance).
This is an explanation unto men, and a guidance and a warning unto those who fear evil. 
Do not give way nor grieve, for you shall overcome them if you but be faithful.
If a wound touches you, a similar wound has touched the others: these are only the vicissitudes of varying fortune which we bring in turn to mankind that Allah may know those who it is that believe, and may choose from you witnesses, for Allah loves not the unjust. 
And that Allah may prove those who believe, and blot out the disbelievers.
Did you think that you can enter Paradise without Allah testing those of you who fight (or strive) hard, and remain steadfast? 
Verily, you used to long for death before you met it! Now you see it (and flinch)!
Mohammed is but a Messenger, messengers (the like of whom) have passed away before his time. What if he die or is killed, will you retreat upon your heels? He who retreats does no harm to Allah at all; but Allah will recompense the thankful. 
It is not for any soul to die, save by Allah's permission, written down for an appointed time; but he who wishes for the reward of this world We will give him of it, and he who wishes for the reward of the Hereafter We will give him of it, and We will recompense the grateful.
How many prophets, with them large numbers of devoted men, fought (in the cause of Allah)! They did not lose heart at what befell them in Allah's way, nor did they weaken, nor did they demean themselves - Allah loves the steadfast. 
And their word was only to say, "Lord, forgive us our sins and wasted efforts; and make firm our footing, and help us against the faithless folk!" 
So Allah gave them the reward of this world, and also good reward in the Hereafter. Allah does love those whose deeds are good.
O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back upon your heels, and you will retreat as losers. 
Nay, Allah is your Protector; He is the best of helpers. 
We will throw dread into the heart of those who disbelieve, for that they associate partners unto Allah, for which He has revealed no authority; but their resort is fire, and evil is the resort of the wrong-doers.
Allah has truly kept His promise, when you routed them by His permission, until you showed cowardice, and wrangled, and rebelled, after He had shown you what you loved (booty). Amongst you are those who love this world, and amongst you are those who love the Hereafter. Therefore He made you flee from them to try you; but now He has pardoned you, for Allah is Lord of grace unto believers.
And when you climbed (the hill) and looked not round upon any one, although the Messenger was calling you from your rear. Therefore did Allah reward you with trouble on trouble that you should not grieve after what you had missed, nor for what befell you, for Allah is well aware of what you do. 
Then, after grief, He sent down upon you security, as drowsiness crept over one company of you, while another company became anxious about themselves, wrongly suspicious of Allah, with the suspicion of ignorance, and saying, "Have we any part (or chance) in this affair?" Say, "Verily, the affair is Allah's." They conceal in themselves what they will not show to you, and say, "If we had any part (or chance) in this affair we should not be killed here." Say, "Even if you were in your houses, surely those, against whom slaughter was written down, would have gone forth to fight even to where they are lying now; that Allah may try what is in your breasts and prove what is in your heart. Allah is Aware of what is hidden in men's breasts."
Verily, those of you who turned your backs on that day when the two armies met, it was but Satan who made them slip because of something they had earned. But Allah has now pardoned them; verily, Allah is Forgiving and Clement.
O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve, and say unto their brethren who went about in the earth, or are fighting in the field, "Had they but been with us, they would not have died or been killed." That Allah might make it a cause for sighs (regrets) in their heart. It is Allah that gives life and death; and Allah is Seer of what you do.
And if, indeed, you be killed in Allah's way or die therein, surely forgiveness from Allah and mercy is better than what you gather. 
And if you die or be killed it is to Allah that you shall be assembled. 
It was by the mercy of Allah that you did deal gently with them (O Muhammad), for had you been rough and fierce of heart they would have dispersed from around you. But pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult with them on the conduct of affair. As when you have resolved, then put your trust in Allah; verily, Allah loves those who trust (Him).
If Allah help you, there is none that can overcome you; but if He withdraws his help, who is there that can help you? Upon Allah then let believers rely.
It is not for the Prophet to deceive; and he who deceives shall bring his deceit with him on the Day of Resurrection. Then shall each soul be paid what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged. 
Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah, like him who has drawn on himself anger from Allah, whose resort is the Fire? An evil journey's end! 
There are degrees with Allah, and Allah sees what you do.
Allah was surely very gracious to the believers, when He sent amongst them a Messenger from among themselves (or of their own), who recite to them His revelations, and causes them to grow (or be purified), and teaches them the Scripture and wisdom, although they surely were before his time in manifest error. 
What! When a small disaster befalls you, though you have smitten them with twice as much, do you say, "How is this?" Say, "It is from yourselves. Verily, Allah has Power over all things."
And what befell you the day when the two armies met, it was by Allah's permission; that He might know the true believers,
And He might know those who are hypocrites; for it was said to them, "Come, fight in Allah's way," or "Repel (the foe)" But they said, "If we knew how to fight we would surely follow you." They were that day far nearer unto faithlessness than they were to faith, saying with their mouths what is not in their heart. But Allah does know best what they hide.
Those who said of their brethren, whilst they themselves stayed at home, "Had they been guided by us they would not have been killed." Say (unto them), "Then repel from yourselves death, if you are truthful."
Think not those who are slain in the way of Allah as dead. Nay, they are living; with their Lord they have sustenance; 
Rejoicing in what Allah has brought them of His Bounty, glad for those who have not reached them yet, those left behind; there is no fear for them, and they shall not grieve; 
They rejoice at the favour from Allah and grace, and that Allah wastes not the wages of the believers. 
Whoever answered to the call of Allah and of His Prophet after sorrow had befallen them, for those, if they do good and fear evil, there is a great reward. 
Those unto whom men said, "Verily, men have gathered against you, therefore, fear them," but it only increased their faith, and they say, "Allah is enough for us. He is the Most Excellent Disposer of affairs." 
Then they returned with the favour and grace from Allah; no evil touched them; for they followed the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is Lord of infinite Bounty.
It is only Satan who frightens his friends. Fear them not, but fear Me, if you be true believers.
Let not their conduct grieve you, those who vie with each other in disbelief. Verily, they cannot hurt Allah at all. Allah wills not to give them a portion in the Hereafter; but for them is an awful doom.
Verily, those who purchase disbelief for faith, they do not hurt Allah at all, and for them is grievous woe.
Let not those who disbelieve imagine that the respite they have is good for themselves. We only let them have their rein that they may increase in sin. And for them is shameful woe. 
Allah will not leave the faithful in your present state until He separates the vile from the good. And Allah will not inform you of the unseen, but Allah chooses of His Apostles whom He pleases. So believe you in Allah and His Messenger; and if you believe and do right, for you is measureless reward.
And let not those who hoard what Allah has given them of His Bounty think that it is best for them; nay, it is worse for them. What they hoard will be a collar round their necks on the Day of Resurrection. Allah's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is informed of what you do.
Verily Allah heard the speech of those who said, "Verily, Allah is poor and we are rich." We will write down what they said, and how they killed the prophets undeservedly and say, "Taste you the torment of burning;"
This shall they suffer for what their hands have sent on before: - for verily, Allah is no oppressor to His servants, 
Who say, "Verily, Allah has covenanted with us that we should not believe in a Messenger until he brings us a sacrifice which fire devours." Say, "There have come to you Messengers before me with manifest signs, and with the very thing you talk about; why then did you kill them, if you speak the truth?
And if they deny you, even so did they deny Messengers before you, who came with manifest signs, and with the Psalms, and with the illuminating Scriptures.
Every soul must taste of death; and you shall only be paid what you have earned on the Day of Resurrection. But he who is forced away from the Fire and brought into Paradise is indeed triumphant; but the life of this world is but a possession of illusion. 
You shall surely be tried in your wealth, and in your persons, and you shall surely hear much wrong from those who have had the Scripture before you, and from the idolaters. But if you be patient and fear evil, verily, that is the determining heart of affairs.
When Allah took the covenant from those who have received the Scripture, (and said), "You shall of a surety manifest it unto men, and not hide it", they cast it behind their backs, and bought therewith a little gain, but evil is what they buy therewith.
Think not that those who rejoice in what they have given, and love to be praised for what they have not done, - think not that they are in safety from woe - for them is painful woe!
Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Mighty over all things.
Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the succession of night and day, are signs for those who possess understanding;
Such as remember Allah standing and sitting or reclining, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say) "O Lord! Thou hast not created this in vain. Glory be to Thee; preserve us from the torment of the fire! 
"Our Lord! Verily, whomsoever Thou hast made to enter the fire, him, indeed, Thou hast disgraced; and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.
"Our Lord! Verily, we heard a crier calling to the faith, 'Believe you in your Lord,' and we did believe. Lord! Therefore, forgive us our sins and remit from us our offences, and let us die the death of the righteous. 
"Our Lord! Bring us what Thou hast promised us by Thy Messengers, and disgrace us not upon the Day of Resurrection; for, verily, Thou dost not break Thy promises!" 
And the Lord shall answer them, "I waste not the works of a worker amongst you, be it male or female, - you proceed one from the other. So those who fled, and were turned out of their houses, and were harmed in My cause, and who fought and were killed, verily, I will remit their offences, and I will make them enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow - A reward from Allah."  With Allah are the best of rewards.
Let not the vicissitudes of the faithless deceive you. 
It is but a brief comfort, and then their resort is Hell; an evil couch shall it be. 
But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall dwell therein for ever - a welcoming gift from Allah. That which Allah has is best for the righteous.
Verily, of the people of the Book are some who do believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allah. They purchase not a small gain for the revelations of Allah. These shall have their reward with their Lord; verily, Allah is quick at reckoning. 
O you who believe! Endure and vie with one another in endurance, and be on the alert, and fear Allah, in order that you may succeed.
O mankind! Be careful of your duty to your Lord, who created you from one soul, and created there from its mate, and scattered from the twain a multitude of men and women. Be careful of your duty towards Allah, in whose name you claim rights of one another, and the wombs that bore you; verily, Allah is Watcher over you.
And give unto the orphans their property, and give them not the vile in exchange for the good, and devour not their property into your own property; verily, that would be a great sin. 
But if you fear that you cannot do justice by orphans, then marry women who seem good to you, two, three, or four; and if you fear that you cannot be equitable to them, then only one, or what your right hands possess (captives, slaves). This is more likely to keep you from injustice.
And give women their dowries freely; and if they of their own will remit any of it, then accept and enjoy it with good cheer.
But give not unto the weak-minded the property which Allah has entrusted to you to maintain; but feed and clothe them from it, and speak words of kindness and justice to them. 
Prove orphans until they reach a marriageable age, then, if you perceive in them good judgment, hand over to them their property, and do not consume it wastefully and in haste lest they grow up. And the guardian who is rich, let him abstain from remuneration; but he who is poor, let him have what is just and reasonable. And when you deliver to the orphans their property, then have witnesses in their presence. Allah sufficient in taking account.
Men should have a portion of what their parents and kindred leave, and women should have a portion of what their parents and kindred leave, whether it be little or much, a determinate (legal) portion. 
If at the time of division, other relatives, orphans or the poor are present, then bestow on them out of it, and speak to them in words of reason and kindness. 
And let those disposing of the property have the same fear as they would have had they left behind offsprings of their own. Let them fear Allah, and speak appropriately (with consideration). 
Verily, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly, only devour fire into their bellies, and they shall broil in flames.
Allah instructs you concerning your children; for a male the like of the portion of two females, and if there be more than two women, then let them have two-thirds of the inheritance; and if there be but one, then let her have a half. And as to the parents, to each of them a sixth of what he leaves, if he has a son; but if he have no son, and his parents inherit, then let his mother have a third, and if he have brethren, let his mother have a sixth after any legacy he bequeaths or debt has been paid. Your parents or your children, you know not which of them is nearest to you in usefulness. This is an ordinance from Allah; verily, Allah is Knower and Wise! 
And you shall have half of what your wives leave, if they have no child; but if they have a child, then you shall have a fourth of what they leave, after payment of any bequests or debts. And they shall have a fourth of what you leave, if you have no child; but if you have a child, then let them have an eighth of what you leave, after payment of any bequest or debts. And if the man or the woman have a distant heir who is neither parent nor child, and he or she have a brother or sister, then let each of these two have a sixth; but if they are more than two, let them share in a third after payment of any bequest or debts, without prejudice. This is a commandment from Allah, and Allah is Knower and Forbearing!
These are the limits of Allah, and whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger He will make him enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall dwell therein for ever; that is the great success.
But whoever rebels against Allah and His Messenger, and transgresses His bounds, He will make him enter into fire, and dwell therein for ever; and for him is shameful woe.
As for those of your women who commit adultery, call witnesses four in number from among yourselves; and if these bear witness, then keep the women in houses until death release them, or Allah shall make for them a new way. (See 24:2-10)
And if two of you commit it, then punish them both; but if they repent and amend, leave them alone, verily, Allah is easily Relenting, Merciful.
Allah is only bound to forgive those who do evil through ignorance and then repent. Surely, these are the ones to whom Allah is relenting. Allah is Knower Wise. 
His forgiveness is not for those who do evil until death approaches and then he says, "Now I repent", nor yet for those who die faithless. For such We have prepared a grievous woe.
O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will; nor to restrain them so that you may take away part of what you gave them, unless they commit flagrant lewdness; but associate with them with kindness and equity, for if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike something wherein Allah has put much good for you.
But if you wish to exchange one wife for another, and have given one of them a dower (money, gold), then take nothing back from it. What! Would you take it by slander and manifest wrong?
How can you take it when one of you has gone in unto the other, and they have taken from you a solemn contract?
And do not marry women your fathers married - except what has already happened - for it is an abominable and hateful practice, and an evil way. 
Unlawful for you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your paternal aunts and maternal aunts, and your brother's daughters, and your sister's daughters, and your foster mothers, and your foster sisters, and your wive's mothers, and your step daughters who are your wards, born of your wives to whom you have gone in - but if you have not gone in unto them, then it is no crime in you - and the lawful spouses of your sons of your own loins, and that you have two sisters together - except what has already happened. Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful; 
And all married women (are forbidden unto you), save such as your right hands possess (captives of war) - It is a decree of Allah for you. But lawful for you are all beyond these. So seek them with your wealth in honest marriage and not lust. But such of them from whom you seek comfort, give them their portions as a duty; and there is no crime in what you do by mutual agreement after the duty has been done. Verily, Allah is ever Knower and Wise.
But whoever of you cannot marry free women who believe, then marry from what your right hands possess, believing maids; Allah knows best about your faith. You arise one from the other, so marry them with the permission of their people, and give them their portions in kindness and equity, they being chaste and not lecherous, and not of loose conduct. But when they are married, if they commit fornication, then inflict upon them half the penalty for free women; that is for whomsoever of you fears wrong; but that you should have patience is better for you, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Allah wishes to explain to you and to guide you into the ordinances of those who were before you, and would turn towards you in mercy, for Allah is Knowing, Wise. 
Allah wishes to turn towards you in mercy, but those who follow their own lusts (desires, prejudices, addictions, superstitions) wish that you should go far astray!
Allah wishes to make the burden light for you, for man was created weak.
O you who believe! Squander not your property amongst yourselves vainly, but use it in trade by mutual consent. And do not destroy yourselves (or kill one another); verily, Allah is ever Merciful unto you.
But whoever does that maliciously and unjustly, we will broil him with Fire; for that is easy with Allah.
If you avoid great sins from which you are forbidden, We will remit (or expel) your lesser offences (or all evil in you) and make you enter a noble gate.
And do not covet that by which Allah has preferred one of you over another. The men shall have what they earn, and the women what they earn; but instead (of envy) ask Allah for His Bounty, verily, Allah is All-Knowing.
To every one have we appointed sharers (heirs, kinfolk, partners) to property left by parents and relatives. And to those with whom you have joined right hands (made pledges, contracts, marriages), give them also their portion. For, verily, Allah is Witness over all things.
Men are qawwam (have charge of, are protectors, maintainers) of women in that Allah hath made them superior in strength (or advantages), and in that they expend of their wealth (in support of women). So virtuous women are devoted (or obedient), careful (in their husband's) absence, as Allah has cared for them. But those whose perverseness you fear, admonish them (first) and (then) remove them from your bedchambers, and (lastly) chastise them lightly (or punish by showing disapproval, withdrawing affection, separating) ; but if they obey you, then do not seek a way against them; verily, Allah is Exalted and Great. 
And if you fear a breach between the two (husband and wife), then appoint an arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people. If they wish for reconciliation, Allah will arrange between them; verily, Allah is Knower and Aware.
And serve Allah; associate nothing with Him; show kindness to parents, and to kindred, and orphans, and the needy, and to the neighbour who is a kin, and the neighbour who is a stranger, and the fellow traveller, and the wayfarer, and those whom your right hands possess (slaves). Verily, Allah loves not him who is proud and boastful; 
Who hoard their wealth and bid men to (or promote) avarice, and who hide what Allah has given them of His Bounty. We have prepared for the disbelievers a shameful woe.
And for those who expend their wealth in alms for appearance sake before men, and who believe not in Allah nor in the last day. Whoever takes Satan for his mate, an evil mate has he.
What harm would it do them if they believed in Allah and in the Last Day, and expended in alms of what Allah has provided them? But Allah has full Knowledge about them.
Verily, Allah would not wrong by the weight of an atom; and if it's a good work, He will double it and bring from Himself a mighty reward.
What if We bring from every nation a witness, and bring you as a witness against these!
On the day when those who disbelieve and rebel against the Messenger would wish that they were levelled with the earth, but they cannot hide the facts from Allah.
O you who believe! Approach not prayer while you are drunk (or mentally dull), until you know (can understand) what you are saying; nor yet while polluted - unless you are on a journey - until you have washed yourselves. But if you are sick, or on a journey, or one of you come from the toilet, or if you have touched a woman, and you cannot find water, then use clean sand (or earth) and wipe your faces and your hands therewith. Verily, Allah is Benign and Forgiving.
Do you not see those who have been given a portion of the Book? They buy error, and they wish that you may stray from the way! 
But Allah knows best who your enemies are, and Allah suffices as a Patron (or protecting friend), and sufficient is Allah as a Helper.
And some Jews change words from their context, and say, "We hear but we disobey"; and "We listen without hearing," and "Ra'hina ("Attend to us")" distorting it with their tongues (to mean "Take us to pasture") and slandering religion. But if only they had said, "We hear and we obey", and "We do hear" and "Do attend to us", it would have been better for them and more upright; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, for they will not believe, except a few.
O you who have been given the Book! Believe in what We have revealed, confirming what you had before; ere we deface your faces and turn them into hinder parts, or curse you as we cursed the Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah's is always done.
Verily, Allah pardons not associating anything with Him, but He pardons anything short of that, to whomsoever He pleases; but associating anything with Allah is to devise a mighty sin indeed.
Do you not see those who pride themselves for sanctity? Nay, Allah sanctifies whom He will, and they shall not be wronged a straw.
Behold, how they devise lies against Allah, and that is manifest sin enough.
Do you not see those to whom a portion of the Book has been given? They believe in Gibt and Taghut (Idols and False Deities, vain things, sorcery, superstition), and they say of those who disbelieve, "These are better guided in the way than those who believe." 
These are those whom Allah has cursed, and whom Allah has cursed no helper shall he find.
Shall they have a portion of the kingdom? Why, even then they would not give to men a jot.
Do they envy man for what Allah has given of His grace? We have given to the House of Abraham the Scripture and Wisdom, and we have given them a mighty kingdom. 
And of them are some who believe therein, and of them are some who turn from it, but Hell is flaming enough for them.
Verily, those who disbelieve in Our signs, We will broil them with Fire; whenever their skins are well done, then We will change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the torment. Verily, Allah is Mighty and Wise.
But those who believe and do right, We will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall dwell therein for ever. For them therein are pure companions; We will admit into a shades, cool and deep. 
Verily, Allah bids you repay your trusts to their owners, and when you judge between men to judge with justice. Verily, excellent is what He admonishes you; verily, for Allah is both Hearer and Seer.
O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you; and if you dispute (quarrel or argue) about anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you (in truth) believe in Allah and the Last Day; that is better and fairer in the end.
Do you not see those who pretend that they believe in what has been revealed to them, and what was revealed before you; they wish to refer their judgment to Taghut (the Evil One, or False Deities and authorities), but they were bidden to reject him. But Satan wishes to lead them into a remote error. 
And when it is said to them, "Come round to what Allah has sent down and unto the Messenger," you see the hypocrites turning from you in aversion.
How then when there befalls them a misfortune through their own actions? Then will they come to you, and swear by Allah, "We meant naught but good and concord (harmony, reconciliation)." 
These people - Allah knows the secrets of their heart. Turn you away from them and admonish them, and speak to them words to reach their souls (or about their souls).
We have never sent a messenger save that he should be obeyed by the permission of Allah; and if they, when they have wronged themselves, come to you  and ask pardon of Allah, and the Messenger asks pardon for them, then they will find Allah easily Forgiving, Compassionate.
But no! By your Lord! They will not believe, until they have made you judge of what they differ on; then they will not find in themselves any hindrance to what you have decreed, and they will fully surrender. 
But had we prescribed for them, "Sacrifice your lives, or leave your homes" they would not have done it, save only a few of them. But had they done what they were told, then it would have been better for them, and more strengthening.
And then We would surely have brought them from Our Presence a mighty reward, 
And We would have guided them into the Straight Way.
Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, these are in the company of those unto whom Allah has shown favour, of the prophets and saints and martyrs and the righteous; - the fairest company are they.
Such is the Bounty of Allah, and Allah suffices as Knower.
O you who believe! Take your precautions and go forth in groups or all together. 
Verily, there are some who tarry behind, and, if a mischance befalls you, they say, "Allah has been gracious to us, since we are not martyrs with them."
But if a fortune from Allah befalls you, they would surely say - as though there were no friendship between you and them - "O would that I had been with you, then I would have achieved a great success!" 
Let those then fight in Allah's way who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter; and whoever fights in Allah's way, then, be he killed or be he victorious, We will give him a mighty reward.
What ails you that you do not fight in Allah's way, and for the weak (oppressed) men, women and children, who cry, "Lord, rescue us from this town of oppressive people, and raise for us from Thee a Patron (or protecting friend), and raise for us from Thee  a help?"
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah; and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Taghut (The Evil One); fight you then against the friends (supporters, protectors, patrons) of Satan, verily, Satan's strategies are feeble indeed.
Do you not see those to whom it is said, "Restrain your hands, but be steadfast in prayer and give alms (do charity);" and when it is prescribed for them to fight then, behold, a section of them fear men, with the fear justly due to Allah, or with a still stronger fear, and they say, "Our Lord! Why have you ordered us to fight. Could you not let us abide till our appointed time?" Say, "The enjoyment of this world is but slight (or short), and the Hereafter is better for him who does right. But they shall not be wronged a straw."
"Wherever you be, death will overtake you, though you were in lofty towers." And if a good thing befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah," but if a bad thing, they say, "This is from you (Muhammad)." Say (unto them), "It is all from Allah." What ails these people? They can hardly understand an event.
Whatever befalls you of good (O man) it is from Allah; and whatever befalls you of evil it is from your own soul. We have sent you to (instruct) mankind as a Messenger, and Allah suffices for a witness.
Whoever obeys the Messenger he has obeyed Allah; and he who turns away - We have not sent you as a warder over them.
They say, "Obedience!” But when they sally forth from you, a company of them ponder (meditate, plan, brood) by night over something other than that which you have said; but Allah writes down that over which they ponder. Turn then from them and rely on Allah, for Allah suffices as Trustee. 
Do they not meditate on the Quran? If it were from other than Allah they would find in it many a discrepancy (inconsistencies, contradictions).
And when there comes to them a matter of security or fear they broadcast it; but if they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority amongst them, then those of them who can think would know it; but were it not for Allah's grace upon you and His mercy you would have followed Satan, save a few.
Fight, then, in the way of Allah; impose nothing on anyone else but on thyself (or you are responsible only for thyself), and urge on (or rouse, encourage) the believers. Perchance Allah will restrain the violence of those who disbelieve, for Allah is Mightier, severer in punishment.
Whoever intercedes (recommends, promotes, encourages) well in a good cause shall have the reward there from; but he who intercedes (recommends, promotes, encourages) with a bad intercession shall have the like thereof, for Allah oversees all things.
And when you are greeted with a good (courteous, friendly, beneficial) salutation, salute with a better one, or return it; verily, Allah takes account of all things.
Allah! There is no god but He! He will surely assemble you on the Day (of Judgment or Resurrection), about which there is no doubt; Whose word is truer than Allah's?
What ails you that you have become two parties regarding the hypocrites, when Allah hath cast them back for what they earned? Do you wish to guide those whom Allah hath led astray? Whoever Allah hath led astray you shall surely find for him no path. 
They desire that you disbelieve as they disbelieve, that you might be alike; take you not friends from among them until they too flee in Allah's way; but if they return to enmity, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and take from them neither patron nor help.
Save those who join (or take refuge among) a people betwixt whom and you is an alliance, or those who come to you because their heart forbid them from fighting you or fighting their own people. But had Allah pleased He could have given them power over you, and they would surely have fought you. So if they withdraw from you and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah allows you no way against them.
Thee will find others who seek for security from you, and security from their own people; whenever they obtain it, they are tempted back to hostility: but if they retire not from you, nor offer you (guaranteed) peace, nor restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them (be decisive); over these We have given you manifest warrant.
It is not for a believer to kill a believer save by mistake; and whoever kills a believer by mistake then let him free a believing slave and compensation must be paid to his people, unless they remit it as charity. But if he be from a tribe hostile to you and yet a believer, then let him free a believing slave. And if he comes from a people betwixt whom and you there is an alliance, then let the compensation be paid to his folk and let him also free a believing slave. But he who cannot find the means, then let him fast for two consecutive months - a penance this from Allah, for Allah is Knower, Wise.
And whoever kills a believer purposely, his reward is hell for ever. Allah will be wrath with him, and curse him, and prepare for him a mighty woe.
O you who believe! When you go forth in the way of Allah be discriminate, and do not say to him who offers you a salutation, "You art no believer," craving after the goods of this world's life (wishing to exploit him), for with Allah are abundant spoils! Even so were you before until Allah was gracious to you. Therefore, be you discriminate; verily, Allah is well Informed of what you do.
Not alike are those of the believers who sit at home, except those have a disability, and those who strive in Allah's way with their wealth and their lives. Allah hath preferred those who strive with their wealth and their lives to those who sit still, by many degrees. To each hath Allah promised good, but Allah hath bestowed on those who strive a greater reward than those who sit still,
Degrees of rank from Him, and pardon and mercy, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Verily, the angels when they take the souls of those who had wronged themselves, they say, "What state were you in?" They say, "We were but weak (and oppressed) in the earth;" They say, "Was not Allah's earth wide enough for you to flee (migrate) away?" These are those whose resort is hell, an evil journey's end!
Save for the weak (oppressed) men, and women, and children, who had no means, stratagem or guidance; 
These it may be Allah will pardon, for Allah is Clement and Forgiving.
Whoever flees (migrates) in the way of Allah shall find in the earth many a spacious refuge; and he who goes forth from his house, fleeing unto Allah and His prophet, and then death catches him up - his reward becomes incumbent on Allah, and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And when you travel about in the earth, it is no crime to you that you shorten your prayer for fear that unbelievers will set upon you. Verily, the unbelievers are your obvious foes.
When you (Muhammad) are amongst them, and stand up to pray with them, then let a party of them stand up with you, and let them take their arms; and when they have finished their prostration (adoration, prayers), let them go to the rear, and let another party who have not yet prayed, come forward and pray with you; and let them take their precautions and their arms. The unbelievers wish that you were careless of your arms and your baggage, that they might turn upon you with a single rush. And it is no crime for you that you lay down your arms if you be annoyed with rain or be sick; but take your precautions. Verily, Allah has prepared for the unbelievers a humiliating punishment.
But when you have fulfiled your prayer, remember Allah standing and sitting and lying; and when you are in safety then be steadfast in prayer; verily, fixed times of prayer have been prescribed for the believers.
And slacken not in pursuit of the enemy; if you suffer they shall surely suffer too, even as you suffer; and you hope from Allah what they cannot hope for! And Allah is Knower, Wise.
Verily, We have revealed to you  the Book in truth that you may judge between men by what Allah has shown you; so plead not for (or be used as an advocate by) the treacherous; 
But seek Allah's pardon: Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And contend (argue) not for those who defraud themselves; for Allah loves not him who is a fraudulent sinner. 
They hide themselves from men; but they cannot hide themselves from Allah, for He is in their midst while they brood at night (in darkness or in secret) in words (thoughts, concepts, attitudes) that please Him not; but Allah encompasses all they do!
Here are ye, wrangling for them about this world's life: - but who shall wrangle with Allah for them on the Day of Judgment, or who shall be their defender?
Yet whoever does evil and wrongs his own soul, and then asks pardon of Allah, shall find Allah Forgiving and Merciful; 
Whoever commits (or reaps, earns the wages or consequences of) a wrong (sin, crime), he only commits it against his own soul, for Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And whoever commits a fault or a wrong and throws it on the innocent, he has burdened himself with a falsehood and a manifest crime (sin).
Were it not for Allah's grace upon you, and His mercy, a party of them would have tried to lead you astray; but they only lead themselves astray; they shall not hurt you at all: for Allah hath sent down upon you the Book and the Wisdom, and taught you what you did not know. Mighty was the Grace of Allah on you.
There is no good in much of their secret conferences; save in his who bids almsgiving, or kindness, or reconciliation between men; and whoever does this, craving the good pleasure of Allah, we will give to him a mighty reward.
But he who severs himself from the prophet after the guidance has been made manifest to him, and follows other than the way of the believers, We will turn on him as he hath turned (appointing for him the path to which he himself has turned); and we will make him reach hell, and a bad journeys end shall it be.
Verily, Allah forgives not associating anything with Him, but He pardons anything short of that, to whomsoever He will; but whoever associates aught with Allah, he hath strayed far into error.
Verily, they (Pagans) call on females deities instead of Him; but they call only on Satan, the rebellious.
Allah cursed him. For he said, "I will take from Thy servants a portion due to me,
And surely I will lead them astray; and I will stir up vain desires within them; and I will order them and they shall surely crop the ears of cattle (superstitious practices); and I will order them and they shall surely alter (or corrupt) Allah's creation." But he who takes the devil for his patron instead of Allah, he loses with a manifest loss.
He promises them, and stirs up vain desires within them; but the devil promises only to deceive.
These (Satan's dupes), their resort is hell; they shall not find an escape there from! 
But those who believe, and do what is right, We will make them enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever - It is Allah's promise in truth; and whose word is truer than Allah's?-
Not in accordance with your vain desires, nor the vain desires of the people of the Book. He who does evil shall be recompensed therewith, and shall not find for him beside Allah a patron, or a help. 
But he who does good works, be it male or female, and believes, they shall enter into Paradise, and they shall not be wronged a jot.
Who has a better religion than he who surrenders himself to Allah, and does good, and follows the faith of Abraham, the upright? Allah took Abraham as a friend.
And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, and Allah encompasses all things.
They will ask you for a decision (or instructions) about women; say, "Allah decides for you about them, and so do the Scriptures recited to you (remember them) about female orphans to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them though you are not averse to marrying them; and about the weak (neglected, oppressed and deprived) children; and that you deal fairly with orphans. Whatever good you do, verily, Allah is ever Aware of it."
And if a woman fears from her husband perverseness or aversion (ill-treatment or desertion), it is no crime in them both that they should make terms of amicable settlement, for peace (agreement) is best. But souls are prone to avarice; if you do good (act kindly) and fear Allah (and keep from evil by practicing self-control), Allah is Well-Aware of what you do.
It may be that you will not be able to act equitably to your wives, even though you ardently desire to. But do not turn away from her, leaving her in suspense. If you come to a friendly understanding and avoid evil, then Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
But if they must separate, Allah can provide (make both independent) out of His abundance; for Allah is All-embracing, All-Knowing.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth! We have charged those who have been given the Book before you, and you too, that you fear (respect and do your duty to) Allah. But if you disbelieve, verily, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth, and Allah is Absolute (free of all wants) and Worthy of all Praise!
Yea, unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and on the earth! And Allah suffices as Defender.
If He will He can destroy you, O mankind! and can create another race (or community, nation); Allah is able to do all that.
He who wishes for a reward in this world, (know that) with Allah is the reward of this world and also of the Hereafter, and Allah is both Hearer and Seer.
O you who believe! Be you steadfast in justice, witnesses for Allah, though it is against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, be it rich or poor, for Allah is nearer both than either. Follow not, then, lusts (prejudices, superstitions, passions), so as to act unjustly (or with bias); but if you swerve or turn aside, Allah is well Aware of what you do.
O you who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messengers, and the Book (Scripture) which He hath revealed to His Messenger, and the Book (Scripture) which He sent down before you; for whoever disbelieves in Allah, and His angels, and His Messenger, and the last day, has strayed far into error.
Verily, those who believe and then disbelieve, and then again believe and then disbelieve, and then increase in disbelief, Allah will never pardon them, nor will He guide them in the Way.
Give to the hypocrites the glad tidings that for them is grievous penalty.
Yea, to those who take the disbelievers for their patron rather than believers. Do they crave honour from them? Verily, all honour is with Allah!
He hath revealed this to you in the Book, that when you hear the signs of Allah rejected and mocked, then sit you not down with them until they turn to another topic, for verily, then you would be like them. Verily, Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers into hell together.
Those who lie in wait for you, and if the victory be your s from Allah, say, "Were we not with you?" and if the unbelievers have a chance of success, they say, "Did we not gain an advantage over you, and defend you from the believers?" But Allah shall judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; for Allah will not give the faithless a way against the faithful.
Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He deceives them; and when they rise up to pray, they rise up lazily to be seen of men, and little do they remember Allah; 
Wavering (in distraction) between this and that, (belonging) neither to these nor yet to those! But whomsoever Allah causes to go astray you shall not find for him a Way.
O you who believe! Take not disbelievers for friends rather than believers; do you wish to give Allah a proof (or warrant) against you?
Verily, the hypocrites are in the lowest depths of hell-fire, and you will not find for them a help.
Save those who repent, and do right, and take tight hold on Allah, and are sincere in religion for (or purify religion for) Allah; these are with the believers, and Allah will give to the believers mighty reward.
Why should Allah punish you, if you are grateful and believe? For Allah is Responsive and Aware.
Allah loves not publicity of evil speech, unless one has been wronged; for Allah is Hearer and Knower.
If you do good openly or in secret, or forgive evil, verily, Allah is Forgiving and Powerful!
Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and desire to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers, and say, "We believe in some and disbelieve in others," and desire to take a midway course between the two,
These are the disbelievers, and We have prepared for disbelievers shameful woe! 
But those who believe in Allah and His messengers, and who do not make a distinction between any one of them, to these Allah will give their wages, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful!
The people of the Book will ask you to bring down for them a book from heaven; but they asked Moses a greater thing than that, for they said, "Show us Allah openly;" but the thunderbolt caught them in their injustice. Then they chose the calf, after what had come to them of manifest signs; but We pardoned that, and gave Moses evident authority. 
And We held over them the mountain (Sinai) for their covenant, and said to them, "Enter you the door prostrate (in humility, worship or adoration);" and We said to them, "Transgress not on the Sabbath day", and We took from them a firm covenant.
But then because they broke their covenant, and for their disbelief in Allah's revelations, and for their killing the prophets undeservedly, and for their saying in defiance, "Our heart are uncircumcised, (Our heart are sufficient wrappings or forskins for Allah's Words)" - nay, Allah hath stamped on them their disbelief, so that only a few believe - 
And because of their disbelief, and because of their utterance of a mighty calumny against Mary;
And because of their boastful saying, "Verily, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah," - but they killed him not, nor did they crucify him, but it was obscured for them (or it appeared so to them). And verily, those who differ about him are in doubt concerning him; they have no knowledge thereof, but only follow a conjecture. Certainly, they slew him not!
Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; for Allah is ever Mighty and Wise!
And there shall not be one of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he shall be a witness against them.
And because of the iniquity (or injustice) of the Jews, We have forbidden them the good things which We had made lawful for them, and for their much obstructing the way of Allah, 
And for their taking usury when We had forbidden it, and for their vain devouring of the wealth of people by false pretences, We have prepared for those of them who disbelieve a grievous woe.
But those amongst them who are firm in knowledge, and the faithful who believe in what is revealed to you , and what was revealed before you, and especially the steadfast in prayer, the givers of alms, the believers in Allah and the Last Day, unto these We will give a mighty reward.
Verily, We have inspired you (Muhammad) as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him, and as We inspired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Jacob, and the tribes, and Jesus, and Job, and Jonas, and Aaron, and Solomon; and to David did We give the Psalms.
Of some messengers We have already told you; and of other messengers We have not told you; But Allah spoke directly to Moses;
Messengers giving glad tidings and warning, that men should have no argument against Allah, after the coming of messengers, for Allah is Mighty, Wise!
But Allah bears witness to what He has revealed to you: He revealed it from His own knowledge, and the angels bear witness too; though Allah is witness enough.
Verily, those who disbelieve and obstruct the way of Allah have strayed in wide error.
Verily, those who disbelieve and do wrong (are unjust), Allah will not pardon them, nor will He guide them on the Way
Save the way to hell, to dwell therein forever; that is easy enough to Allah!
O you people! The Messenger has come to you with truth from your Lord: believe, then, in him, for it is better for you. But if you disbelieve, then (know) that to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Knower, Wise
O you people of the Book! Do not commit excesses in your religion, nor say against Allah anything save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was but the messenger of Allah and His Word, which He cast into Mary and a Spirit from Him; believe then in Allah and His messengers, and say not "Three." Desist! it is better for you. Allah is only one Allah, Glory be to Him, too Exalted is He that He should beget a Son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth, and Allah suffices as Defender.
The Messiah does surely not disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor do the angels who are nigh to Him; and whoever disdains His service and is too proud, He will gather them altogether to Himself.
But as for those who believe and do what is right, He will pay their due reward and will give increase to them from His Bounty. But as for those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish them with a grievous woe. Nor will they find, other than Allah, a patron or help.
O you people! Convincing Proof has come to you from your Lord, for We have sent down to you manifest light. 
Then those who believe in Allah, and take tight hold of Him, He will admit them into His mercy and Grace; and He will guide them to Himself by a Straight Way.
They ask you for a legal pronouncement; say, "Allah gives you a decision concerning remote kinship." If a man dies and have no child, but have a sister, let her have half of what he leaves; and had she died, he would be her heir, if she have no son. But if there be two sisters, let them both have two thirds of what he leaves; and if there be brethren, both men and women, let the male have like the portion of two females. Allah makes this manifest to you lest you err; for Allah is Knower of all things.
O you who believe! Fulfil all your undertakings (and obligations). Lawful for you are beasts, save what is here announced. Forbidden you is the chase while you are on pilgrimage. Verily, Allah ordains according to His Will and Plan.
O you who believe! Profane not the Symbols of Allah (things connected with the pilgrimage), nor the sacred month (of pilgrimage), nor the sacrificial offering, nor the garlands (decorating these animals), nor those who sojourn at the sacred house (Kaaba), craving the grace and pleasure of their Lord. But when you are clear of the sacred precincts and the pilgrim's garb then you may hunt again. And let not hatred against the people who once turned you from the Sacred Mosque tempt you to transgress; but help one another unto righteousness and pious duty. Help not one another unto sin and enmity; but fear (respect and keep your duty to) Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in punishment.
Forbidden to you (for food) is that which dies of itself, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is devoted to other than Allah, and that which has died by strangling, or by violence, or by a fall, or by goring, and which has been eaten by wild animals - except what you slaughter correctly - and what is sacrificed to idols. And (forbidden) is the dividing (raffling) of carcasses by arrows (i.e. by games of chance). This is an abomination. This day are the disbelievers in despair of harming your religion; fear them not, but fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion, and completed My favour unto you, and have chosen for you as religion Al-Islam. But he who is forced by hunger, not inclined wilfully to sin, verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
They will ask you what is lawful for them? Say, "Lawful for you are all good things. And what you have trained hunting animals to catch, in the manner directed by Allah; - so eat of what they catch for you, but mention the name of Allah over it, and fear Allah, for verily, Allah is swift in taking account."
This day all things good and pure are made lawful for you. The food of those to whom the Book has been given is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them; and chaste women of those who believe, and chaste women of those to whom the Book has been given before you - when you have given them their marriage portions and live with them chastely, not in fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines (or paramours). But whoever denies the faith, of a truth his work is vain, and he shall be among the losers in the Hereafter.
O you who believe! When you rise up to prayer wash your faces, and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe your heads, and your feet down to the ankles. And if you are polluted, then purify yourselves (bathe). But if you are sick, or on a journey, or if you come from the toilet, or if you have touched women and cannot find water, then take from high ground (clean) sand or earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith. Allah does not wish to make a burden for you; but He wishes to purify you and to fulfil his favour upon you; that you may give thanks.
Remember the favour of Allah to you and His covenant which He made with you, when you said, "We hear and we obey;" and fear (respect and keep your duty to) Allah. Verily, Allah knows well the secrets in your breasts.
O you who believe! Stand steadfast as witnesses for Allah with justice; and let not hatred of (or towards) a people tempt you to injustice. Act with equity, that is nearer to piety, and fear Allah; for Allah is Aware of what you do.
Allah has promised to those who believe and work righteousness, that for them is forgiveness and a mighty reward. 
But those who disbelieve and deny Our Signs, these are the fellows of hell.
O you who believe! Remember Allah's favour towards you, when a people intended to stretch their hands against you, but He withheld their hands from you. Keep your duty to Allah, and in Allah let believers trust. 
Allah did in the past make a covenant with the children of Israel, and raised up among them twelve chiefs; and Allah said, "Verily, I am with you, if you be steadfast in prayer, and give alms, and believe in My Messengers, and assist them, and lend to Allah a goodly loan; then will I remit from you your offences and make you enter gardens beneath which rivers flow: and whoever disbelieves after that, he hath erred from the Even Way (The Path of Rectitude)."
And because they broke their covenant, We cursed them, and placed hardness in their heart. They perverted the words from their contexts, and forgot a portion of what they were admonished. you will not cease to find treachery from all, save a few of them; but pardon them and bear with them (tolerate or ignore their perversity); verily, Allah loves the kind.
And of those who say, "Verily we are Christians," We have (also) taken a covenant; but they have forgotten a goodly portion of the message; wherefore have We excited amongst them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will inform them of what they have done.
O you people of the Book! Now has Our Messenger come to you to expound unto you much of what you used to hide in the Book, and forgiving (or abolishing) much. Now has come unto you light from Allah, and a perspicuous Book -
Allah guides thereby those who seek His pleasure, to the way of peace, and leads them out of darkness into light by His decree, and guides them unto a Straight Way.
They, indeed, have disbelieved who say, "Verily, Allah is the Messiah the son of Mary." Say, "Who can do anything against Allah, if He wished to destroy the Messiah, the son of Mary, and his mother, and those who are on earth altogether?" Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between the two; He creates what He will, for Allah has power over all things!
But the Jews and the Christians say, "We are the sons of Allah and His beloved." Say, "Why then does He punish you for your sins? Nay, you are mortals, men whom He has created! He pardons whom He pleases, and punishes whom He pleases; for to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and what is between the two, and unto Him is the journeying."
O people of the Book! Now Our Messenger has come to you to make things plain, after an interval in the succession of Messengers, lest you say, "There came not to us a herald of glad tidings nor a Warner." But now there has come to you a herald of glad tidings and a Warner. Allah has power over all things!
Remember when Moses said to his people, "O my people! Remember the favour of Allah towards you when He made amongst you prophets, and made for you kings, and brought you what was never given to anyone else in the world. 
"O my people! Enter the Holy Land which Allah has ordained for you; and be not thrust back upon your hinder parts, for surely you retreat losers."
They said, "O Moses! Verily, therein are giants; and we will surely not enter therein until they go out from thence; when they depart, then will we enter." 
Then said two of those who were God-fearing - Allah had been gracious to them both - "Enter you upon them by the gate, for once you have entered it, verily, you shall be victorious; so put your trust in Allah if you be, indeed, believers." 
They said, "O Moses! We shall never enter it so long as they are therein; so, go you and your Lord and fight you two; we will sit down here." 
Said he, "My Lord, verily, I can control only myself and my brother; therefore, part (distinguish) us from this rebellious people."
He (the Lord) said, "Then, verily, this land is forbidden them for forty years; in bewilderment shall they wander about in the earth; so grieve not yourself for these sinful people."
Recite to them the true tale of the two sons of Adam; truly when they offered an offering and it was accepted from one of them, and not from the other. Said the latter, "I will surely kill you." Said the former, "Surely, Allah only accepts from those who fear (are righteous). 
"If you do stretch forth your hand to kill me, I will not stretch forth mine to kill you; for, verily, I fear Allah the Lord of the Worlds.
"Verily, I would rather that you draw upon yourself my sin and yours, and become of the fellows of the Fire, for that is the reward of the evil-doer (or unjust)." 
But the other's soul compelled him to slay his brother, and so he slew him, and became one of the losers. 
Then Allah sent a crow to scratch in the earth and show him how he might hide his brother's naked corpse. He said, "Alas, for me! Am I too helpless to become like this crow and hide my brother's naked corpse?" and in the morning he was of those who did repent.
For this cause have We prescribed to the children of Israel that whoever kills a soul, unless it be for murder or for mischief (or corruption) in the land, it would be as though he had killed all mankind; but whoever saves the life of one, it would be as though he had saved mankind. Our Messenger came to them in the past with manifest signs, afterwards, verily, many of them commit excesses in the earth.
The reward of those who make war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive after corruption (or disruption) in the earth, is only that they shall be slaughtered or crucified, or their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or that they shall be banished from the land. That is a disgrace for them in this world, and in the Hereafter is mighty woe; 
Save for those who repent before you overpower them. For know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! Fear (be dutiful to) Allah and crave the means to approach Him, and strive in His way in order that you may succeed (or prosper).
Verily, those who disbelieve, even though they had all that is in the earth, and the like thereof with it, to offer as a ransom from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them; but for them is grievous woe. 
They may wish to go forth from the Fire, but they shall not go forth there from. For them is lasting woe.
The thief, man or woman, cut off their hands (or ability to do evil or means of livelihood). It is the reward of their own deeds, an exemplary punishment from Allah (or one making an example). Allah is Mighty, Wise.  
But whoever repents after his wrongdoing (injustice) and makes amends, verily, Allah will relent towards him, for, verily, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do you not know that Allah, His alone is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He punishes whom He pleases, and forgives whom He pleases, for Allah has power over all things?
O you Messenger! Let not those grieve you who vie with each other in disbelief, be they of those who say with their mouths "We believe," but their heart are faithless; or of those among Jews, listeners to a lie, who listen to other people, but not to you. They pervert the words from their context and say, "If this is what you are given, take it; but if you are not given it, then beware!". But he whom Allah wishes to try, you have no authority with Allah for him. These are those whose heart Allah wishes not to purify. For them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is mighty woe. 
They are listeners to falsehood, eaters of unlawful things! But if they come to you, then judge between them or ignore them. If you turn aside from them they shall not harm you at all, but if you judge, then judge between them with justice, for verily, Allah loves the just. 
But why should they make you their judge, when they have their own Law, wherein is Allah's judgment? Yet they turn back even after that, for they do not really believe.
Verily, it was We who have revealed the Torah in which there is guidance and light; the prophets who had surrendered did judge the Jews thereby, as did the Rabbis (masters) and doctors of Law. To them was entrusted the Book of Allah to judge by, and they were witnesses to it. Fear not men, but fear Me, and sell not My Signs (or revelations) for a miserable price. Whoever will not judge by what Allah has revealed, these are the disbelievers.
We have prescribed for you therein "a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds equal retaliation;" But whoever remits it, it is an expiation for him. Whoever judges not by what Allah has revealed, these are the wrong-doers (the unjust).
And We followed up the footsteps of these (prophets) with Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which was before him, and We bestowed upon him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, verifying what was before it of the Torah (Hebrew Scripture), a guidance and an admonition unto those who fear (or ward off evil).
Then let the people of the gospel judge by that which is revealed therein, for whoever will not judge by what Allah has revealed, these are the evil doers.
And unto you (Muhammad) have We revealed the Book in truth, verifying what was before it, and preserving it. Judge then between them by what Allah has revealed, and follow not their lusts (prejudices, fantasies), turning away from what is given to you of the truth. For each of you have We appointed a Law and a traced out Path. Had Allah pleased He would have made you one nation, but that He may try you by that which He has given you. Therefore, vie with one another in virtue. Unto Allah will you all return, and He will then inform you concerning that wherein you dispute.
Wherefore judge you between them by what Allah has revealed, and follow not their lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions); but beware lest they mislead you  from part of what Allah has revealed to you ; and if they turn back, then know that Allah wishes to smite them for some sins of theirs. Verily, many men are rebellious (evil doers).
Is it the judgment of the Time of Ignorance (i.e. before the Revelation) for which they crave? But who is better than Allah as judge for people who are certain?
O you who believe! Take not the Jews and Christians for your friends (or patrons): they are friends (or patrons) to each other. Whoever amongst you takes them for friend (or patron), verily, he is of them, and, verily, Allah guides not an unjust people.
You will see those in whose heart is a disease runs about among them, saying, "We fear lest a reversal befall us." It may be that Allah will give you victory, or a commandment from Himself, and they may awake repenting of their secret thoughts.
Then those who believe say, "Are these they who swore by Allah with their strongest oath that they were surely with you?"- Their works have failed and they shall wake up ruined.
O you who believe! Whoever of you turns away from his religion, Allah will bring (instead) a people whom He loves and who love Him, humble to believers, stern to unbelievers, striving in the way of Allah, fearing not the blame (or reproach) of any blamer (or critic). That is Allah's Grace! He gives it unto whom He pleases, for Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.
Only Allah is your friend, and His Messenger and those who believe, who are steadfast in prayer and give alms, bowing down (in prayer). 
Whoever takes as friend Allah and His Messenger and those who believe - verily, the Fellowship of Allah will be victorious!
O you who believe! Take not for friends and patrons those who take your religion for a jest or a sport, from either amongst those who have been given the Book before or the disbelievers; but fear Allah if you have true faith.
Nor those who, when you call to prayer, take it for a jest and a sport; that is because they are a people without understanding.
Say, "O people of the Book! Do you disapprove of us for no other reason but that we believe in Allah, and the revelations that have come to us, and what was revealed before, and that most of you are rebellious (and disobedient)?"
Say, "Shall I declare unto you something much worse than this for retribution from Allah?" It is those whomsoever Allah has cursed and been wroth with - and he has made of them (as) apes and swine - and who worship Taghut (idols), they are in a worse plight and are more erring from the Even Path. 
When they come to you they say, "We believe;" but they entered with unbelief, and they went out the same way, and Allah knows best what they did hide.
Thee will see many of them vying in sin and enmity, and in devouring unlawful things, - evil is it that they have done.
Why do not their rabbis and their doctors forbid them from speaking sin and eating unlawful things - verily, evil is what they have performed.
The Jews say, "Allah's hand is fettered" (incapable or ungenerous), but it is their hands that are fettered and they are cursed for what they say. Nay! His hands are outspread, He spends how He pleases! And that which has been sent down to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in their rebellion and disbelief, for We have cast amongst them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they light a fire for war, Allah puts it out; they strive for corruption in the earth, but Allah loves not the corrupters.
But if only the people of the Book would believe and fear (avoid evil), We would remit their offences, and We would make them enter into Gardens of Delight.
And if they had been steadfast in the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them from their Lord, they would surely have nourishment from above them and below them. Amongst them are a people who are moderate, but many of them are of evil conduct.
O Messenger! Make known what has been revealed to you from your Lord. If you do it not then you have not conveyed His message, and Allah will not protect you from (mischief making) men for Allah guides not people who disbelieve.
Say, "O people of the Book! You have no ground to stand on till you stand fast by the Torah and the Gospel, and what is revealed to you from your Lord." But what has been revealed to you from your Lord will of a surety increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief. Vex not thyself then for a people who disbelieve.
Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews, and the Sabaeans, and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and does what is right, they shall not fear, nor shall they grieve.
We took a covenant in the past from the children of Israel, and We sent to them Messengers; every time there came to them a messenger with what their souls loved not, some of them they did call liars and some of them they slew.
And they thought that no harm would come to them; but they were blind and deaf! And then Allah turned (in mercy) again towards them: and even then many amongst them were wilfully blind and deaf! Allah is Seer of what they did.
They surely disbelieve who say, "Verily, Allah is the Messiah the son of Mary;" but the Messiah himself said, "O children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." (JohnVerily, he who associates anything with Allah, Allah hath forbidden him Paradise, and his resort is the Fire, and the unjust shall have none to help them.
They disbelieve who say, "Verily, Allah is the third of three;" for there is no God but one, and if they do not desist from what they say, there shall touch those who disbelieve amongst them grievous woe.
Will they not turn again towards Allah and ask pardon of Him? For Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The Messiah, the son of Mary, is only a Messenger: Messengers like him have passed away before him; and his mother was a saintly woman. And they both used to eat food. See how We clearly explain to them the revelations, yet see how they turn aside!
Say, "Will you serve, other than Allah, that which can neither hurt you nor profit you?" Allah it is Who is both Hearer and Knower.
Say, "O people of the Book! Exceed not in your religion other than the Truth, and follow not the lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions) of a people who have erred in the past, and who lead many astray, and who go astray from the Even Path."
Those of the children of Israel who went astray were cursed by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary; that is because they rebelled and did transgress; 
They would not restrain each other from the wickedness they did; verily, evil is that which they used to do. 
Thee will see many of them taking those who disbelieve for their friends. Surely, evil is that which their souls have sent before them, for Allah's wrath is on them, and in the torment shall they dwell.
But had they believed in Allah and the Prophet, and what was revealed to him, they would not have taken these for friends. But many of them are evildoers.
Thee will surely find that the strongest in enmity against those who believe are the Jews and the idolaters (Pagans); and you will find the nearest in love to those who believe to be those who say, "We are Christians". That is because there are amongst them men devoted to learning (or priests) and men who have renounced the world (or monks), and because they are not proud.
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you will see their eyes overflow with tears at what they recognize as Truth; and they will say, "O our Lord! We believe, so record us amongst the witnesses. 
Why should we not believe in Allah and the Truth that is given to us, nor desire that our Lord should make us enter the company of the righteous?"
Therefore has Allah rewarded them, for what they said, with Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever; that is the reward of those who do good.
But those who disbelieve and say Our revelations are lies, they are the fellows of hell.
O you who believe! Forbid not the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, nor transgress (or commit excess); verily, Allah loves not the transgressors.
But eat of what Allah has provided you, lawful and good things; and fear (do your duty to) Allah, in Whom you believe.
Allah will not take you to task for the unintentional (or futile) word in your oaths (or promises), but He will take you task for oaths you swear in earnest. The expiation thereof is to feed ten poor men with the average food you feed your families with, or to clothe them, or to free a slave; but he who has not the means, then let him fast three days. That is the expiation of your oaths, when you have sworn; but keep your oaths. Thus does Allah explain to you His revelations that you may be grateful.
O you who believe! Verily, strong drinks (intoxicants, fermented or alcoholic drinks), and el maisar (gambling, trying to get something for nothing), and statues (idols), and divining arrows (superstitions and games of chance)) are only an abomination of Satan's work; avoid them then that per chance (or possibly) you may succeed (or prosper).
Satan only desires to place enmity and hatred between you by wine and maisar, and to turn you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer; will you not, then, desist.
Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and beware, for if you turn back then know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to deliver the message clearly?
There is no crime in those who believe and do right, for having tasted forbidden food, when they fear (guard themselves from evil) and believe. So fear (do your duty to) Allah, and believe, and do what is right; and again fear (do your duty), and believe; and again fear (do your duty), and do good; for Allah loves those who do good.
O you who believe! Allah will try you with something of the game (by hunting) that your hands and your lances take, that Allah may know who fears Him in secret; and whoever transgresses after that, for him is grievous woe.
O you who believe! Kill not game while you are on pilgrimage. But he amongst you who kills it purposely, he shall compensate the equivalent of that which he has killed, in domestic animals - of which two just persons amongst you shall judge - an offering brought to the Kaaba; or as an expiation, the feeding of the poor, or an equivalent thereof in fasting; that he may taste the evil result of his deed. Allah pardons bygones; but whoever repeats, Allah will take vengeance on him, for Allah is Mighty and Lord of Retribution.
Lawful for you is the game of the sea, and to eat thereof; a provision for you and for seafarers; but forbidden you is the game of the land while you are on pilgrimage; so fear Allah to whom you shall be gathered.
Allah has made the Kaaba, the Sacred House, to be a standard (or an Asylum of Security) for men, and also the Sacred Month, and the Offering (sacrifices) and its Garland (which mark them); this is so that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and that Allah is Knower of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, but that Allah is also Forgiving, Merciful.
The Messenger has only the duty to proclaim the message, but Allah knows what you show and what you hide.
Say, "The evil shall not be deemed equal with the good, although much of evil attracts you." Fear (do your duty to) Allah then, O you who have understanding that you may succeed (or prosper).
O you who believe! Ask not questions about things which if they are shown to you would trouble you; but if you ask about them when the Quran is being revealed, they shall be made plain to you. Allah pardons this, for Allah is Forgiving and Clement. 
People before you have asked such questions, yet on the morrow they disbelieved therein (or lost their faith).
And Allah has not instituted (superstitions like those of) Bahirah or Saibah, nor Wazilah nor Hami, (classes of cattle revered and liberated in honour of idols) but those who disbelieve invent a lie against Allah, for most of them have no sense.
And when it is said to them, "Come round to what Allah has revealed unto His Apostle," they say, "Enough for us is that wherein we found our fathers." What! Even though their fathers had no knowledge whatever and no guidance?
O you who believe! You have charge of (or guardianship of) your own souls; he who errs can do you no hurt if you are rightly guided. Unto Allah will you all return, and He will declare to you the truth of that which you did.
O you who believe! Let there be a witnesses among you when any of you is on the point of death at the time he makes his will - two equitable persons from amongst your family or two others from some other folk, in case you are journeying away in the land, and the calamity of death befall you. If you doubt them, then shut them both up after prayer, and they shall both swear by Allah, "We will not sell our testimony for a price (or take a bribe), even for a relative, nor will we hide Allah's testimony. If we do then verily, we shall be among the sinners." 
But if it later found that they too have deserved the imputation of sin, then let two others stand up in their place with those who think them deserving of the imputation, the nearest two in kin, and they shall both swear by Allah, "Indeed, our testimony is truer than the testimony of those other two, and we have not transgressed, for then we should surely be of the unjust."
Thus is it more likely that they will bear true testimony according to its purport; else must they fear lest an oath be given to rebut their own oath. So let them be mindful of their duty to Allah and listen, for Allah guides not the people who do evil.
On the day when Allah will assemble the Messengers and say, "What was your response from mankind.” they will say, "We have no knowledge; verily, Thou art He who knows in full the hidden."
Then Allah will say, "O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favours towards you and towards your mother, when I aided you with the Holy Ghost, so that you did speak to men in childhood and in maturity. Behold, I taught you  the Book and Wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel; and behold, you did create of clay, as it were, the likeness of a bird, by My power, and did blow thereon, and it became a bird by My power; and you did heal the blind from birth, and the lepers by My permission; and when you did bring forth the dead by My permission; and behold, I did restrain the children of Israel from (violence to) you , when you did come to them with manifest signs, and yet those who disbelieved amongst them said, 'This is naught but obvious magic.'
"And when I inspired the Disciples that they should believe in Me and in My Messenger, they said, 'We believe; do you bear witness that we have Surrendered. (become Muslims)'"
When the Disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary! Is your Lord able to send down to us a table spread with food from heaven?” he said, "Fear Allah, if you be true believers." 
And they said, "We desire to eat there from that our heart may be at rest, and that we may know that what you have told us is the truth, and that we may be thereby amongst the witnesses." 
Said Jesus the son of Mary, "O Allah, our Lord! Send down to us a table spread with food from heaven, to be a feast for us, for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art the best of Providers."
Allah said, "Verily, I will send it down to you; but whoever disbelieves amongst you after that, verily, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one in all the worlds."
And when Allah said, "O Jesus, son of Mary! Was it you who did say to men, take me and my mother for two gods, beside Allah?" He said, “Glory be to Thee! What could have ailed me that I should have uttered what I had no right to? If I had said it, Thou wouldst have known it; Thou knowest what is in my mind, but I know not what is in Thy mind. Verily, Thou, only Thou art the Knower of the hidden. 
"I never told them save that which Thou didst command me (John7:16), 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord,' and I was a witness of them so long as I was amongst them (see John17:6); but when Thou didst take me away to Thyself Thou wert the Watcher over them, for Thou art Witness over all. 
"If Thou punish them, then lo! They are Thy slaves; and if Thou forgive them (lo! They are the slaves also) Lo! Thou alone are the Mighty and the Wise." 
Allah said, "This is the day when their truthfulness shall profit the truthful, for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they dwell in security for ever. Allah is well pleased with them, and they well pleased with Him; that is the great triumph (happiness, fulfilment, achievement, success)."
Unto Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens, and the earth, and all that is therein, and He has Power to do all things.
Praise belongs to Allah who created the heavens and the earth, and hath brought into being the darkness and the light. Yet do those who disbelieve ascribe partners to Him.
He it is who created you from clay; then He decreed a term - a term fixed with Him. And yet still you doubt.
He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He knows your secret (or hidden) conduct and your public (or manifest) ones, and He knows what you earn.
There came to them none of revelations of their Lord, but they turned away.
And now they reject the truth that has come to them, but soon shall come to them a message (They shall learn the truth) about that at which they mocked.
Do not they see how many a generation We have destroyed before them, whom We had established more firmly than you, and sent them abundant rain from heaven, and made the rivers flow beneath them? Yet We destroyed them for their sins, and raised up other generations after them.
Had We sent down to you a book on paper, and they had touched it with their hands, still those who disbelieve would have said, "This is naught but obvious magic." 
They say, "Why has not an angel been sent down to him?" But if We had sent down an angel, the affair would have been decided at once, and then they would have had no respite.
And had We appointed an angel, We would have had to send him in the form of a man too (that he may speak to men) and this would have made perplexing for them that which they deem perplexing now.
There have been Messengers before you who were mocked at, but that at which they mocked surrounded (mocked, turned the tables on) the mockers.
Say, "Travel in the land and see the nature of the consequences for the rejecters (for those who called them liars)."
Say, "Whose is that which is in the heavens and the earth?" Say, "Allah's. He has imposed (prescribed) mercy on himself." He will surely gather you together on the Day (of Resurrection and Judgment), of which there is no doubt. But those who ruin their own souls will not believe.
His is whatsoever dwells in the night or in the day, He is Hearer and Knower.
Say, "Shall I take as a patron other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He feeds but is not fed." Say, "I am bidden to be the first of those who Surrender;" and it was said to me, "Be not you of the idolaters." 
Say, "I fear, if I rebel against my Lord, the retribution of an Awful Day."
From whomsoever it is averted on that day, Allah hath truly had mercy on him; and that is obvious triumph (salvation, success, happiness, fulfilment).
And if Allah touch you with harm (affliction, ill fortune), there is none can remove it but He; and if He touch you with good, He has Power over all things. 
He is Omnipotent (sovereign) over His servants, He is the Wise, the Aware!
Say, "What is the strongest evidence (testimony, witness)?" Say, "Allah is witness between you and me. This Quran was inspired in me to warn you and those it reaches. Can you really bear witness that there are other gods besides Allah?" Say, "I bear no such witness." Say, "He is but one Allah, and I am innocent of that which you associate (with Him)."
Those to whom We have brought the Book know this (revelation) as they know their own sons - those who ruin their souls do not believe.
Who is more unjust than he who forges against Allah a lie, or denies His revelations? Verily, the unjust shall not prosper.
On the day when We shall gather them all together, then shall We say to those who have associated others with Ourself, "Where now are those associates whom you did invent?" 
Then they will have no excuse but to say, "By Allah our Lord, we did not associate gods with Allah!"
See how they lie against themselves, and how what they did invent deserts them! 
And among them are some who listen unto you, but We have placed a veil upon their heart lest they should understand it, and in their ears is deafness; and though they saw each sign they would not believe therein, to the point that when they come to you to argue with you, the unbelievers say, "These are but old folks' tales."
They forbid it and they avoid it; but they destroy none but their own souls, though they perceive not.
But could you but see when they are set over the Fire and say, "Would that we were sent back! We would not then deny our Lord's revelations, but we would be of the believers?" 
Nay! Now is shown clearly to them what they did hide before; and were they to be sent back, they would return to that which they were forbidden, for they are liars.
They say "There is naught but this life of ours in the world and we shall not be raised again." 
But could you see when they are set before their Lord, He says, "Is not this the real?" They will say, "Yea, by our Lord!" He will say, "Then taste the penalty because you did disbelieve!"
Losers, indeed, are they who disbelieved in meeting Allah, until, when the hour comes suddenly upon them, they say, "Alas for us, that we were neglectful!" They shall bear their burdens on their backs; evil is what they bear.
Naught is the life of this world but a game (or pastime) and a sport (or amusement). Surely, better by far is the abode of the Hereafter for those who fear (and do their duty). Will you not understand?
Full well We know that that which they say grieves you; but in truth they deny not you, but the unjust flout the revelations of Allah. 
Indeed, Messengers have been called liars before you; but they were patient under denial and persecution until Our help came to them; for there is none to alter the words of Allah. Already has there come to you the story of those He sent in the past.
And if their aversion be hard for you, and if you can, seek for a shaft down into the earth, or a ladder up into the sky, to bring them a sign - if Allah pleased He could have brought them all to guidance - be you not then of the ignorant.
Only those can accept who hear. As for the dead, Allah will raise them up, then unto Him shall they return.
They say, "Why has not a sign been sent down from his Lord" Say, "Verily, Allah has power to send down a sign, but most of them do not understand."
There is not a beast upon the earth nor a bird that flies with both its wings, but is a people like to you; We have omitted nothing from the Book. Then to their Lord shall they be gathered.
Those who rejected Our signs are deaf and dumb, in darkness! Whom He pleases does Allah sends astray, and whom He pleases He places on the Straight Way.
Say, "Can you see yourselves! If there should come Allah's punishment, or there should come to you the Hour, would you call on other than Allah, (answer that) truthfully?" 
Nay, it is on Him that you would call, and He will remove that because of which you call upon Him, if He will; and you forget that which you did associate with Him.
Ere this We sent unto nations before you, and We sent them distress and adversity that per chance (or possibly) they might humble themselves. 
If only, when Our violence falls upon them, they had been humble, but their heart was hard, and Satan made seemly to them all that they used to do.
And when they forgot what they were reminded of, We opened for them the gates of all things, until when they rejoiced at what they had, We caught them up suddenly (or unawares, unexpectedly), and Lo! They were plunged into despair.
And the uttermost part of the people who did wrong were cut off. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds!
Say, "Think you! If Allah should remove your hearing and your sight, and should set a seal upon your heart, who is god but Allah to restore it to you?" See how We expound the revelations unto them! Yet still they turn away.
Say, "Think! If Allah's punishment should come to you unawares or openly (expectedly), would any perish save the people who do wrong?"
We do not send our messengers save as heralds of glad tidings and of warning, and whoever believes and acts aright, there is no fear for them, and they shall not be grieved.
But those who deny Our signs, torment shall afflict them, because they used to disobey.
Say (O Muhammad), "I do not say unto you that mine are the treasuries of Allah, nor that I know the unseen, and I do not say unto you, I am an angel. I follow only that which is inspired in me." Say, "Is the blind man equal to him who sees? Will ye, then not reflect?
Admonish therewith those who fear that they shall be gathered unto their Lord; there is no patron for them but Him, and no intercessor, that per chance (or possibly) they may fear (avoid evil).
Repel not those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening, seeking His Countenance (Face, Presence); they are not accountable to you in anything, and you are not accountable to them in anything. Repel them and you will be of the unjust.
Thus did We try some of them by (or in comparison with) others, that they may say, "Are these those unto whom Allah has been gracious amongst us?" Does not Allah know those who give thanks?
And when those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say, "Peace be on you! Allah hath prescribed for Himself mercy; verily, he among you who does evil in ignorance, and then repents and does right, verily, He is Forgiving and Merciful."
Thus do We expound Our revelations, that the way of the sinners may be made plain.
Say, "I am forbidden to worship those you call upon anything beside Allah." Say, "I will not follow your lusts (desires, prejudices, fantasies), for then would I err and not be of the rightly guided."
Say, "I rely on a manifestation (proofs) from my Lord, which you deny. I have not with me that for which you are impatient. The decision is a matter for Allah alone, He declares the Truth and He is the best of Judges."
Say, "If I had that for which you are impatient, then the matter between you and me would have been settled immediately. But Allah is best aware of the wrong-doers."
With Him are the keys (and treasures) of the unseen. None knows them save He; He knows what is in the land and in the sea; and there falls not a leaf save that He knows it; nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor aught that is moist, nor aught that is dry, but it is inscribed in a clear Record.
He it is who gathers you to Himself at night, and knows what you have committed in the day; then He raises you up again, that your appointed time may be fulfiled; in the end unto Him is your return, and then will He inform you of the truth of what you have done.
He is omnipotent over His servants; He sets guardians over you until, when death comes to any one of you, Our messengers receive him and they never fail their duty.
Then are they returned to Allah, their true and just Sovereign. Is not His the judgment (or rule)? But He is the most swift at reckoning.
Say, "Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and of the sea?" You call upon Him in humility and in secret, saying "Indeed, if He would rescue us from this, we will surely be of the thankful." 
Say, "Allah rescues from the darkness, and from every affliction, yet you associate others with Him."
Say, "He is able to send calamities on you from above you and from beneath your feet, and to confuse you with dissenting sects, and to make you taste the violence of each other." See how We explain the Signs, in various ways that per chance (or possibly) they may understand.
Your people called it a lie, and yet it is the truth. Say, "I have not been put in charge over you.
For every Announcement (Message, prophecy) there is a set term, and you will soon come to know it."
When you see those who plunge deeply into vain discussion of Our Signs (revelations), turn away from them until they discuss another topic. It may be that Satan makes you forget, but sit not, after you have remembered, with the congregation of the faithless (or unjust or wrong-doers).
Those who fear (or avoid evil, the righteous) are not accountable for them at all, but remind them (or give them the Reminder, i.e. the teachings of the Quran) that per chance (or possibly) they may learn to fear (Allah).
Leave alone (forsake, abandon) those who have taken their religion for a play (pastime) and a sport (jest, amusement), whom the life of the world has deceived, and remind them hereby lest a soul be destroyed by what it has earned. It has, beside Allah, no patron or intercessor; and though it should offer every compensation (or ransom) it will not be accepted. Those are they who perish by their own deserts. For them is (the similitude of) a drink of boiling water, and grievous woe because they persisted in their disbelief.
Say, "Shall we call, instead of unto Allah, unto that which neither profits us nor harms us, and be thrown back upon our heels after Allah has guided us - like him whom Satan hath led away infatuated and bewildered in the earth, who has companions who call him to misguidance, saying, 'Come to us? '" Say, "Verily, Allah's guidance is true Guidance, and we are bidden to surrender unto the Lord of the Worlds.
"And to be steadfast in prayer and to fear Him (avoiding evil), for He it is to whom we shall be gathered."
He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in truth; and on the day when He says, "BE”, it is. His word is Truth; and His is the Kingdom on the day when the trumpets shall be blown, the Knower of the unseen and of the evident; He is the Wise and Aware.
Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols for gods? Verily, I see you and your people in obvious error." 
Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of heaven and of the earth, that he should be of those who possess certainty. 
And when the night overshadowed him he saw a star and said, "This is my Lord;" but when it set he said, "I love not those that set." 
And when he saw the moon beginning to rise he said, "This is my Lord;" but when it set he said, "If Allah my Lord guides me not I shall surely be of the people who err." 
And when he saw the sun beginning to rise he said, "This is my Lord, this is the greatest of all;" But when it set he said, "O my people! Verily, I am clear of what you associate with Allah; 
Verily, I have turned my face to Him who originated the heaven and the earth, as a 'Hanif' (as one who is by nature upright), and I am not of the idolaters."
And his people disputed with him. He said, "Do you dispute with me concerning Allah, when He has guided me? But I fear not what you associate with Him; unless my Lord should wish it (nothing can happen). My Lord does comprehend all things in His knowledge. Will you not then remember (or understand or be admonished)? 
How should I fear that which you associate with Him, when you yourselves fear not to associate with Allah that for which you have no warrant (proof or power to do)? Which then of us two parties is worthier of certainty (of belief), tell me if you know?"
It is those who believe and confuse not their faith with wrong, they are those who shall have security, and they are the rightly guided.
These are our arguments which We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise whom We will by degrees of wisdom. Verily, your Lord is wise and Aware. 
And We gave to him Isaac and Jacob, each did We guide - And before him We guided Noah - and among his seed, David and Solomon and Job, Joseph, Moses and Aaron, - for thus do We reward those who do good. 
And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias, all righteous ones; 
And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonas and Lot, each one have We preferred above all creatures, 
With some of their forefathers and their offsprings and their brethren; We have chosen them and guided them into the Straight Way.
Such is the Guidance of Allah wherewith He guides those whom He will of His servants; and if they associate (for worship) anything with Him, their works would have been in vain.
It is to these We gave the Book and the Judgment and Prophethood. But if they disbelieve therein, then, indeed, We shall entrust it to a people who will not disbelieve. (See Matthew 8:11-12, Galatians 3:7-16) 
It is these that Allah hath guided, and by their guidance be you led. Say (O Muhammad), "I ask of you no fee for it. Lo! It is naught save a reminder to the worlds."
They estimate not the power of Allah by its true measure (or worth) when they say, "Allah has never revealed anything to a mortal." Say, "Who revealed the Book wherewith Moses came, a light and a guidance unto men? You put it on papers which you show, though you hide much; and you are taught by it that which you knew not, neither you nor your fathers." Say, "Allah," then leave them in their play (vain disputation).
This is the Book which We have revealed, bringing blessing and confirming those which came before it, and to warn the Mother of Cities (Mecca) and those around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe therein, and they are steadfast in their worship.
Who is more wicked than he who devises against Allah a lie, or says, "I am inspired," when he has received none at all? And who says, "I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed"? But did you see when the unjust are in the floods of death, and the angels stretch forth their hands, saying, "Yield up your souls; this day shall you be recompensed with the torment of disgrace, for that you did say against Allah what was not true, and were too proud to hear His signs.
And you come now alone as We created you at first, and you have left behind you that which We granted you; and We see not with you your intercessors whom you pretended were your partners amongst you; so between you have all ties been cut asunder; and that which you fancied has deserted you."
Verily, Allah it is who splits the grain and the date-stone (for sprouting); He brings forth the living from the dead, and it is He who brings the dead from the living. Such is Allah! How then can you be deluded?
He it is who cleaves out the morning, and makes night a repose, and the sun and the moon two reckonings (of Time). That is the decree of the Mighty, the Wise!
He it is who made for you stars that you might be guided thereby in the darkness of the land and of the sea. Now have We detailed the signs unto a people who have knowledge.
He it is who made you spring from one soul, and gave you a settlement and a depository (or a temporary and a permanent residence). Now have We detailed the signs unto a people who have discerning.
He it is who sends down rain from the heavens; and We bring forth therewith growths of all kinds; and We bring forth there from green crops, from which We bring forth grain in full ear; and the palm, from its sheathes come clusters of dates within reach; and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, alike and unlike; - behold its fruit when it fruits and ripens! Verily, in that you have a sign for the people who believe.
Yet they made the Jinn equal with Allah, though He did create them! And they ascribed to Him sons and daughters, though they have no knowledge; Glory and all Praise be to Him! Exalted is He above what they attribute to Him! 
The Originator of the heavens and the earth! How can He have a son, when He has no female companion, and when He has created everything, and He is Aware of all things?
That is Allah - your Lord! There is no Allah but He, the Creator of all things; so worship Him, for He takes care of all things!
Vision comprehends Him not, but He comprehends all vision, for He is the Subtle, the Aware.
Now has insight (or proof) come unto you from your Lord, and he who sees therewith it is for his own good; but he who is blind thereto, it is against his own soul. And I am not your keeper.
Thus do We expound Our Signs in various ways, that they may say, "You have studied," and that We may make clear to those who have knowledge.
Follow what is inspired in you from your Lord; there is no god but He, and shun the idolaters.
But had Allah pleased, they would not have associated aught with Him. We have not made you a keeper over them, nor are you for them a warder (or responsible for them).
Revile (or abuse) not those who call on other than Allah, for then they may abuse Allah openly in their ignorance. Thus We make seemly to every nation their deeds. But unto their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of the truth of what they used to do.
They swore by Allah with their strongest oaths, that if there come to them a Sign they will indeed believe therein. Say, 'Signs are only in Allah's hands - but understand that even when one has come, they will not believe (or understanding is in Allah's hand)."
We confound their heart and their eyesight, even as they believed not at first, We will leave them, in their rebellion, blindly wandering on.
And had We sent down unto them angels, or the dead had spoken to them, or We had gathered together the hosts before their very eyes, they would not have believed unless Allah so willed - but most of them are ignorant.
So have We appointed for every Prophet an enemy - devils of men and Jinns; who inspire each other with seductive, deceptive speech which leads astray; but had your Lord willed they would not have done so. So leave them with what they do devise.
And let the heart of those who believe not in the Hereafter listen to it; and let them be well pleased with it; and let them gain what they can gain!
Shall I seek for Judge other than Allah, when it is He who has sent down to you this Book in detail? Those to whom We gave the Book know that it is sent down from your Lord, in truth. So, be not you of those who doubt.
The words of your Lord are perfected (or fulfiled) in truth and justice. There is none to change His words, for He is Hearer and Knower.
But if you follow most of those who are in the land, they will lead you astray from the Way of Allah. They follow naught but opinion (conjecture or suspicion) and they only guess.
Your Lord, He knows best who errs from His path, and He knows best the rightly guided.
Consume then of that over which Allah's name has been pronounced, if you believe in His signs (or revelations). 
Why should you not eat from that over which Allah's name has been pronounced, when He has detailed unto you what is unlawful for you, unless you are compelled (or under necessity). But, verily, many are lead astray (or will lead you astray) by their lusts (or fancies, prejudices) through ignorance. Verily, your Lord knows best the transgressors.
Forsake the outer and inner (and the open and secret) sin, verily, those who earn sin shall be recompensed for what they have earned.
But consume not of that over which the name of Allah has not been pronounced, for, verily, it is an abomination. Verily, the devils inspire their friends to dispute with you. But if you obey them, then you will be, indeed, idolaters.
Is he who was dead and We have quickened (given him life) him, and made for him a light, wherein walks amongst men, like him whose likeness is one walking in utter darkness whence he cannot emerge? Thus is their conduct made seemly to the disbelievers.
And thus have We placed great ones (leaders) in every town, its wicked ones, that they may plot therein. But they do but plot against themselves, though they perceive not.
And when there comes to them a Sign, they say, "We will not believe until we receive something like the Messenger received." Allah knows best where to put His Message. There shall befall these wicked ones, humiliation in Allah's eyes, and grievous torment for their scheming.
Whomever Allah wishes to guide, He expands His breast unto the Surrender (Islam); but whomever He wishes to lead astray, He tightens and constricts his breast as though he were climbing steeply into heaven. Thus does Allah set dishonour on those who do not believe.
This is the way of your Lord, a Straight Way. We have detailed the revelations unto a mindful people.
For them is an abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their patron because of what they used to do.
One day He shall gather them all together, (and say) "O assembly of Jinns! You have taken much toll of (seduced, exploited) mankind." And their clients from among mankind shall say, "Our Lord! Much advantage had we one from another, but now, alas, we have reached the end of the term which you did appoint for us." He will say, "The Fire is your home, dwell therein for ever, except as Allah wills." Verily, your Lord is Wise and Aware.
Thus do We make some of the wrongdoers patrons of one another, because of what they earn.
O assembly of jinn and men! Did there not come to you Messengers of your own (or from amongst you), relating to you Our Signs, and warning you of the meeting of this Day? They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves." The life of this world deceived them, and they bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.
That is because your Lord would never destroy a township arbitrarily, while their people are unaware (of what is wrong).
There are ranks (levels, degrees) according to their deeds; and your Lord is not unaware of that which they do.
your Lord is Absolute, Merciful; if He pleases He can remove you and can cause what He will to succeed you, even as He raised you up from the seed of other people.
Verily, what you are promised will surely come to pass, nor can you frustrate it.
Say (O Muhammad), "O my people! Work according to your power, verily, I, too, am working; and soon shall you come to know whose is the happy outcome in the Hereafter!" Certainly, the unjust shall not prosper.
They set apart a portion for Allah, from that which He raises in abundance, of tilth and of cattle, and they say, according to their fancies "This is for Allah and this is for (His) partner." But the share of their "partners" reaches not to Allah, and that which was for Allah reaches their "partner". Evil is their judgment.
Even so, have their "partners" made seemly to many of the Pagans (idolaters), the killing of their children, leading them to their own destruction, and to the obscuration for them of their religion. If Allah willed they would not have done so. But leave them alone and their inventions.
And they say, " Such and such cattle and crops are inviolable; none shall taste thereof, save such as we please." - So they say - "And there are cattle whose backs are forbidden to burden (or yoke), and cattle over whom Allah's name is not pronounced (at slaughter)" - inventions against Him! He shall reward them for their inventions.
And they say, "What is in the wombs of these cattle is reserved for men and unlawful for our women, but if it be still born, then all may have shares in it." He will reward them for their superstitious attributions; verily, He is Wise and Aware.
Losers are they who slay their children, from folly, without knowledge, and who forbid what Allah has bestowed upon them, inventing lies against Allah. They have, indeed erred and heeded not guidance.
He it is who brought forth gardens with trailing and untrailing vines, and the palms and corn land, with various food, and olives, and pomegranates, alike and unlike. Eat from the fruit thereof whenever it fruits, and bring the dues thereof on the harvest day, and be not wasters (greedy or extravagant). Verily, He loves not the wasters.
And cattle (He produces) some to carry burdens and some to eat. Eat of what Allah has bestowed upon you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan; verily, he is to you an open foe.
Eight pairs - of sheep two, and of goats two; say, "Hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge if you tell the truth." 
And of camels two, and cows two; say, "Are the two males unlawful, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were you witnesses when Allah ordained this for you? - Then who is more unjust than he who devises a lie against Allah, to lead men astray without knowledge? Verily, Allah guides not the unjust people."
Say, "I cannot find, in what I am inspired with, anything unlawful for the eater to eat thereof, except it be carrion, or shed blood, or the flesh of swine - for that is foul - or an abomination that is consecrated to other than Allah. But he who is forced, not wilfully nor transgressing - then, verily, your Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."
To those who were Jews did We prohibit everything that hath a solid (undivided) hoof; and of oxen and sheep did We prohibit to them the fat, save what the backs of both do bear, or their entrails, or what is mixed with bone; this in recompense for their rebellion, for, verily, We are true.
And if they give you  the lie, say, "your Lord is of all-embracing Mercy, but His Wrath shall never be withdrawn from the guilty."
Those who associate partners with Allah will say, "Had Allah pleased, we would not associated partners (with Him), nor our fathers; nor should we have forbidden aught." Thus did they give the lie to those who came before them, until they tasted of Our wrath! Say, "Have you any knowledge (proving this)? If so, bring it forth to us: you only follow opinion, and you do but guess (conjecture, speculate)."
Say, "Allah's is the final (searching, conclusive, decisive) argument; and had He pleased He would have guided you all."
Say, "Bring forward your witnesses to prove that Allah has forbidden these!" But if they do bring such witnesses, bear you not witness with them; nor follow the vain desires of those who say Our Signs (revelations) are lies, and those who believe not in the Hereafter, or those who for their Lord make equals.
Say, "Come! I will recite what your Lord has made a sacred duty for you - that you may ascribe no partner unto Him; that you do good to your parents; and that you slay not your children because of poverty, for We will provide for you and them; and that you draw not nigh to lewd sins, either apparent or concealed; and kill not the life, which Allah hath made sacred save in the course of justice; this is what Allah commands you, per chance (or possibly) you may understand." (See the Ten Commandments in Exodus, Chapter 20 and Deuteronomy, Chapter 5.)
And draw not nigh unto the property of the orphan, except to improve it, until he reaches full age; and give weight and measure with justice - We place not a greater burden on the soul than he can bear - and when you speak (or give your word), then speak justly (or do it justice), even if it be against a near relative; and fulfil the covenant with Allah. This He commands you that per chance (or possibly) you may be mindful. 
Verily, this is My Straight Way; so follow it. Follow not other ways, lest you part yourselves from His way. This is what He has ordained for you, per chance (or possibly) you may fear (and avoid evil)!
Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing for him who would do right, and an explanation and a guidance and a mercy, that per chance (or possibly) they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.
And this is the Book which We have revealed as a blessing; so follow it and fear (be righteous) that per chance (or possibly) you may obtain mercy. 
Lest you say, "The Book (Scripture) was only sent down to two sects before us; verily, we care naught for (or are unaware of) what they read." 
Or, lest you should say, "Had we had a Book (Scripture) revealed to us we should surely have been more guided than they;" But now there is come to them a manifest sign from their Lord, and a guidance and a mercy; who then is more unjust (does greater wrong) than he who denies the Signs (revelations) of Allah, and turns away from them? We will reward those who turn from our Signs with a severe punishment because of their turning.
Do they wait, expecting that the angels should come for them, or that your Lord (Himself) should come, or that one of the Signs of your Lord should come? On the day when the Sign does come, its faith shall profit no soul which did not believe before, nor earned, by its faith, from good works. Say, "Wait you expectant, we wait expectant too."
Verily, those who divided their religion and became sectarians, you have no concern with them. Their affair is in the hands of Allah, He will then inform them of that which they used to do.
He who brings a good work shall receive tenfold the like thereof, but he who brings a bad work shall be recompensed only with the like thereof, for they shall not be wronged.
Say, "As for me, my Lord has guided me unto the Straight Way, a right religion, the faith of Abraham, the upright, for he was not of the idolaters."
Say, "Verily, my worship and my sacrifice, and my living and my dying belong to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. 
He has no partner. This I am commanded, and I am foremost of those who surrender (unto Him)"
Say, "Shall I crave for other than Allah for Lord, when He is Lord of all?" But each soul earns only on its own account, nor does any laden soul bear the burden of another. Then unto your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning that wherein you differ.
He it is who made you Vicegerents (Agents, Successors, Inheritors) of the earth, and raised some of you above others in degree (or rank, virtue, power, wealth, ability etc.), to try you by that which he has given you; Verily, your Lord is swift to punish, but, verily, He is Forgiving and Merciful.
ALIF LAM MIM SAD.
 7:2.This is a Book revealed to you (O Muhammad) - so let there be no heaviness in your breast, that you may warn the erring thereby, and remind the believers.
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and follow not beside Him other patrons; little is it that you remember (of admonition).
Yet how many a town have We destroyed, and Our wrath came upon it by night, or while they slept at noon; 
 7:5.And their cry, when Our wrath came upon them, was only to say, "Verily, we were unjust (wrongdoers)!"
But We will certainly question those to whom the Message was sent and those by whom We sent it.
Then We will narrate to them with knowledge, for We were never absent.
The balance on that day is true, and those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful;
But those whose scales are light, they it is who lose their souls, for that they did act unjustly by Our Signs (revelations, creatures).
We have given you power (authority) in the earth, and provided for you therein the means of self-fulfilment (livelihood, opportunities, resources, faculties); little thanks give ye.
It is We who created you, and then gave you Form (shape), then We said unto the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam (do him obeisance)," and they fell prostrate, except Iblis, who was not of those who make prostration (or have humility).
He (Allah) said, "What hinders you from prostration when I command you?" He (Iblis) said, "I am better than he; you have created me from Fire, and him you have created out of Clay."
Said He, "Then get you down from this (situation); what ails you that you should be arrogant here? Go forth! Verily, you are of the meanest (the degraded)."
He (Iblis) said, "Respite me until the day when they shall be raised." 
He (Allah) said, "Verily, you are of those given respite." 
He (Iblis) said, "For that Thou hast led me into error, I will lie in wait for them (ambush them) in Thy Straight Way; 
Then I will surely come to them, from before them and from behind them; and most of them you shall not find thankful."
He said, "Go forth here from, despised, expelled. Whoever follows you, I will surely fill hell with you all." 
"But, O Adam, dwell you and your wife in Paradise and eat from whence you will, but draw not nigh unto this Tree or you will be of the unjust (transgressors)."
Then Satan whispered to them (planted suggestions in their minds) to display to them what was kept back from them of their shame (they felt shame or guilt for the first time), and he said, "your Lord has only forbidden you this tree lest you should become angels, or should become of the immortals." 
And he swore to them both, "Verily, I am unto you a sincere adviser;" 
And so he beguiled them by deceit. And when the twain had tasted of the Tree, their shame was manifested unto them, and they began to sew upon themselves the leaves of the Garden (to hide their shame, nakedness. rebelliousness or sinfulness) And their Lord called unto them, "Did I not forbid you that tree, and say to you, that verily, Satan is to you an open foe?" 
They said, "O our Lord! We have wronged our own souls - and if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we shall surely be of those who are lost!" 
He said, "Go you down, each one of you an enemy to the other. In the earth will be your abode, and a provision for a season." 
He said, "Therein shall you live and therein shall you die, from it shall you be brought forth at last."
O children of Adam! We have revealed to you garments wherewith to cover your shame, and adornments (ornaments, embellishments, enhancements); but the garment of righteousness (restraint from evil), that is best. That is one of the Signs of Allah, per chance (or possibly) you may remember.
O children of Adam! Let not Satan infatuate you as he drove your parents out of Paradise, stripping from them their garments, and exposing for them their shame; verily, he watches you, he and his tribe, from whence you cannot see them. Verily, We have made the devils patrons of those without Faith. 
And when they commit an abomination (shameful things) they say, "We found our fathers at this, and Allah bade us do it."  Say, " Nay, Allah bids you not to do abominations (shameful things); do you say against Allah that which you know not?"
Say, "My Lord commands only justice: - set your faces steadfastly at every place of worship and call upon Him, making religion (or your way of life) pure for Him only. As He brought you forth in the beginning, so shall you return unto Him. 
A section is led by His guidance, while error has just hold on another, for, verily, they did take the devils for their patrons instead of Allah, and deemed that they were guided."
O children of Adam! Take your adornments (clothes, grooming, manners, etiquette etc.) to every place of worship and eat and drink, but do not be extravagant (wasteful), for He loves not the extravagant (wasteful).
Say, "Who has prohibited the beautiful adornments (gifts) of Allah which He brought forth for His servants, and the good things He has provided?" Say, "On the Day (of Resurrection and Judgment) they shall only be for those who believed when they were in the life of this world." Thus do We detail the Signs (revelations) unto a people who have understanding.
Say, "My Lord has only forbidden abominable (shameful) deeds, the apparent and the concealed, and sin (errors), and greed for that which is not right (trespasses against truth and reason), and associating with Allah that for (or to) which He has given no authority (or power), and saying about Allah that of which you have no knowledge."
Every nation (or community) has its appointed term, and when their appointed term is completed they cannot delay it an hour, nor can they advance it.
O children of Adam! Verily, there will come to you Messengers from amongst you, narrating unto you My Signs; then whoever fears Allah (refrains from evil) and does what is right (makes amends), there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve. 
But those who reject Our Signs, and who are arrogant, these are the Fellows of the Fire, they shall dwell therein.
Who is more unjust than he who devises a lie against Allah, and scorns His Signs (or revelations)? For such, their portion of the Book (of Destiny) shall reach them, until, when Our Messengers come to take their souls away, and say, "Where is now what you used to rely upon instead of Allah?" They reply, "They have departed from us." And they shall bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers (rejecters of truth).
He will say, "Enter you the Fire amongst the nations (communities) who have passed away before you - both of jinn and men." Whenever a nation (community) enters therein, it curses its sister (nation, community); until, when they have followed each other into the Fire, the last of them will say about the first, "O our Lord! These it was who led us astray, give them a double penalty of the Fire!" He will say, "Double for each of you!" But this you do not understand.
Then the first will say to the last, "You have no preference (advantage) over us (or were no better than us), so taste you the penalty for that which you have earned!"
Verily, those who deny and scorn Our Signs in arrogance, for these the doors of heaven shall not be opened, nor shall they enter into the Garden, until a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. Such is Our reward for the guilty. (Compare with MatthewMark 10:25)
For them is Hell, as a couch below them and coverings above them! Thus do We reward the unjust!
But those who believe and do what is right - We will not oblige a soul with more than it's capacity - they are the companions of the Garden; they shall dwell therein.
We will strip away what rancour (ill feeling) is in their breasts. There shall flow beneath them Rivers, and they shall say, "Praise belongs to Allah who guided us to this! For we should not have been led aright had not Allah guided us! Verily, the Messenger of our Lord did come to us with truth!" And they shall hear the cry, "Behold, the Garden which you have as an inheritance for that which you used to do!" 
And the Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire, "We have now found that what our Lord promised us is true; have you also found that what your Lord promised you is true?" They will say, "Yea!" And a crier from amongst them will cry out, "The curse of Allah is on the unjust,
"Who turn (or hinder) from the way of Allah and crave to make it crooked, and disbelieved in the Last Day (or the Hereafter)."
And betwixt the two (Hell and Paradise) there is a veil, and on the Heights are men (exalted or able men) who know each by their marks; and they greet the companions of the Garden, "Peace be upon you!" They enter it not though they hope (or desire, or are assured) to do so.
But when their sight is turned towards the Companions of the Fire, they say, "Our Lord! Place us not with the unjust people." 
And the Companions of the Height will call out to the men whom they know by their marks, and say, "Of what profit to you were your hoarding (of wealth), and what you were so arrogant about."
Behold, are these others not those of whom you swore, that Allah would not extend mercy? But it is said to them "Enter you Paradise; there is no fear for you, nor shall you be grieved."
But the Companions of the Fire cry out to the Companions of the Garden, "Pour out upon us water, or something of what Allah has provided you with (for sustenance, benefit or comfort)." They will say, "Allah has forbidden them both to those who rejected Him; 
Such who took their religion for an amusement, sport and a pastime; who were beguiled by the life of the world." This day have We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this Day, and because they did deny Our Signs!
Now We have brought them a Book explaining it with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe.
Do they just wait now for its fulfilment (or interpretation)? On the day when its fulfilment shall come, those who forgot it before will say, "Indeed, there did come to us the Messenger of our Lord in truth. Have we no intercessors now to intercede for us? Or, could we return, we would behave otherwise than we did in the past." But they have lost their souls, and that which they devised has strayed away from them.
Verily, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days; then mounted He the Throne (of Authority and Power). He covers night with the day - it pursues it incessantly- and the sun and the moon and the stars are subject to His command. Aye! - His is the Creation and the Commandment - Blessed be Allah the Lord of the Worlds!
Call on your Lord humbly and secretly, verily, He loves not the aggressors (the arrogant, the transgressors). 
Work not confusion (chaos, mischief or evil) in the earth after it has been rightly ordered, and call upon Him with fear and hope (longing and earnestness); for, verily, the mercy of Allah is nigh unto those who do well.
He it is who sends forth the winds like tidings heralding His mercy; until when they lift the heavy cloud which We drive to a dead land, and send down thereon water, and, thereby, bring forth every kind of fruit; - Thus do We bring forth the dead; per chance (or possibly) you may remember.
And the good land brings forth its vegetation by the permission of its Lord; and that which is vile brings forth naught but sparsity (bad with little good). Thus do We expound Our signs for a people who are grateful.
We did send Noah unto his people, and he said, "O my people I serve Allah; you have no God but Him; verily, I fear for you the torment of the mighty (awful) Day." 
Said the chiefs of his people, "Verily, we do surely see you in obvious error." 
Said he, "O my people! There is no error in me; but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.
I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I give you sincere advice; and I know from Allah what you know not. 
Marvel you that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by a man from amongst you, to warn you, that you may fear evil, and that per chance (or possibly) you may receive mercy?"
But they called him a liar, and We rescued him and those who were with him in the ark; and We drowned those who denied Our Signs. Verily, they were a blind people.
And unto the people of Ad (we sent) their brother Hud, who said, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God save Him; What! Will you not then fear evil?" 
The chiefs of his people, who disbelieved, said, "Verily, we see you in folly, and, verily, we certainly think you are of the liars." 
He said, "O my people! There is no folly in me; but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds; 
I convey to you the messages of your Lord; and, verily, I am to you a faithful adviser. 
Marvel you then that there comes to you a Reminder from your Lord by a man from amongst you, to warn you? Remember when He made you vicegerents (or inheritors) after Noah's people, and gave you growth of stature (prosperity, honour, excellence). Remember, then, the bounties of your Lord, that per chance (or possibly) you may be successful!" 
They said, "Have you come to us that we may serve Allah alone, and forsake what our fathers used to worship? Then bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful!" 
He said, "Already have fallen upon you from your Lord terror and wrath; do you wrangle with me about names, which you and your fathers have named yourselves, for which Allah sent down no warrant. Then wait expectant, lo! I, too, am of those waiting with you.
But We rescued him and those with him, by Our Mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our signs and did not believe."
Unto the people of Thamud We sent Salih, one of their own brethren. He said, "O my people! Serve (or worship) Allah; you have no God but Him. There has come to you a manifest Sign from your Lord. This is Allah's she-camel, a sign (or test) unto you; so leave her to feed in Allah's land, and touch her not with evil, or there will overtake you grievous woe. 
And remember how he made you vicegerents (agents, inheritors) after Ad and established you in the earth so that you took for yourselves castles on its plains and hewed out mountains into houses. So remember the bounties of Allah, and waste not the land, despoiling it."
The chiefs from amongst his people, those who were inflated with pride, said to those whom they despised, those amongst them who believed, "Know you that Salih is sent from his Lord?" They said, "We do believe in that with which he is sent." 
The arrogant scornfully said, "Verily, we disbelieve in what you believe." 
Then they did hamstring the she-camel, and rebelled against the commandment of their Lord and said, "O Salih! Bring upon us what you did threaten us with, if you are of those who are sent."
Then the earthquake seized them, and in the morning they lay prone in their dwellings.
And Salih turned away from them and said, "O my people! I did deliver unto you the message of my Lord, and I gave you good advice; but you love not sincere advisers."
And (remember) Lot, when he said to his people, "Do you approach an abomination which no creature ever did before you?
"Verily, you approach men with lust instead of women. Nay, you are a people who far exceed the bounds."
But his people's answer was only to say, "Turn them out of your communities. Verily, they are a people who strive to purity." 
But We saved him and his people, except his wife, who was of those who lagged behind; 
And We rained down upon them a shower (of brimstone); - see then the nature of the consequences for sinners!
And unto Median did We send their brother Shu'eyb (Jethro?), who said, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God save Him. There has come to you a manifest Sign from your Lord. So give good weight and full measure, and be not niggardly of your good works (or of the gifts you have received) to mankind, and do not evil in the earth after it has been rightly ordered. That is better for you if you are believers.
"And lurk not in every path, threatening (and corrupting) and hindering from the path of Allah those who believe in Him, craving to make it crooked. Remember when you were few (small or weak) and He multiplied (increased, strengthened) you; and see what was the end of the corrupters! 
"And if there be a party of you who believe in what I am sent with, and a party who believe not, then wait patiently until Allah judges between us, for He is the best of Judges." 
The chieftains of his people, inflated with arrogance said, "We will of a surety turn you out, O Shu'heyb, and those who believe with you, from our communities, unless you return unto our faith." Said he, "What! Even if we be averse to it?" 
"We shall have devised a lie against Allah if we return unto your faith, after Allah has saved us from it; and what should ail us that we should return thereto, unless that Allah our Lord should please? Our Lord is All-comprehending in His knowledge. In Allah do we place our trust. Our Lord! Decide with truth between us and our people, for you are the best of those who decides. 
But the chiefs of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, "If you follow Shu'eyb, verily, you shall be the losers;"
So the earthquake seized them, and in the morning they lay prone in their dwellings. 
Those who denied Shu'eyb, became as though they had not dwelt there! - Those who had denied Shu'eyb, they were the losers! 
And he turned away from them and said, "O my people! I delivered unto you the messages of my Lord, and I gave you good advice; how should I be vexed for a people who disbelieve?"
We have not sent unto a community any prophet but We inflicted the people thereof with tribulation (suffering, distress) and adversity, that per chance (or possibly) they might humble themselves.
And then did We exchanged good for evil (suffering for prosperity), until they grew (in strength and prosperity) and said, "Our fathers, too, were touched by both suffering and joy." Then We overtook them suddenly ere they realized their peril. 
Had the people of the town but believed and feared, We would have opened up for them blessings from the heavens and from the earth; but they said it was a lie, so We overcame them for that which they had earned.
Were, then, the people of these cities secure that Our Wrath would not come on them by night, while they slept?
Were the people of these cities secure that Our Wrath would not come on them in the morning whilst they played carefree? 
Were they secure from the Plan of Allah? None deems himself secure from the Plan of Allah except a people that are doomed to perish.
Is it not a guidance (lesson) shown to those who inherit the earth after its (former) people, that, did We please, We would smite them in their sins, and would set a stamp upon their heart that they should not hear?
Such were these cities. We do relate to you their stories. There came to them Our Messengers with manifest Signs; but they would not believe because of what they had rejected before. Thus does Allah seal up their heart of those who disbelieve.
Nor did We find most of them true to their covenant; but We did find most of them workers of abomination.
Then We raised up after them Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs; but they dealt unjustly with them. So see what was the consequence for these evildoers (corrupters, mischief-makers)!
Moses said, "O Pharaoh! Verily, I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. 
One, for whom it is not right to speak against Allah aught but the truth. I have come to you with a manifest sign from my Lord. Send, then, the children of Israel with me."
Said he (Pharaoh), "If you have come with a Sign, then bring it, if you are truthful." 
Then he (Moses) threw his rod down, and lo! It was a manifest serpent; 
And he drew out his hand, and lo! It was white to the beholders. 
Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's people, "Verily, this is surely a knowing (expert) magician; 
He desires to turn you out of your land. What is it, then, your advise? 
They said, "Delay him and his brother, and send summoners into the cities;
To bring unto you every knowing (expert) magician." 
And the magician came to Pharaoh and said, "Is there, indeed, a reward for us if we are victors? 
He answered, "Yea! And you shall be of those who are brought nigh unto me (given high posts, ranks or honour)." 
They said, "O Moses! Will you cast down (your rod) or shall we be (first) to throw?" 
Said he, "Throw first". And when they threw down their rods, they bewitched (hypnotized) the people's eyes, and struck terror into them, for they did a mighty magic. 
But We inspired Moses (saying), "Throw down your rod." and it swallowed up their lying show.
And the truth stood fast, and vain was that which they had done.
Thus were they vanquished there, and turned back humiliated! 
And the magicians threw themselves down in prostration. 
Said they, "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, 
The Lord of Moses and Aaron." 
Said Pharaoh, "Do you believe in him ere I give you permission? This is a plot which you have devised in the land, to drive its people hence. But soon shall you know (the consequences)! 
I will cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides, then I will crucify you every one!" 
They said, "Verily, we return unto our Lord! 
Do you take vengeance on us because we believe in the signs of our Lord, when they come to us. Our Lord! Pour out upon us patience and constancy, and take us to Thyself as men who have surrendered (become Muslims)." 
And the chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, "(O King) Will you leave Moses and his people to do mischief in the land, and to flout you and your gods?" Said he, "We will have their sons slain and their women we will spare, for, verily, we have power over them."
Moses said unto his people, "Seek help from Allah and have endurance. Verily, the earth is Allah's! He gives it for an inheritance to whom He pleases of His servants, and the future is for those who fear (keep their duty and are righteous)."
They said, "We suffered before you did come to us, and also since you have come to us." Said he, "It may be that your Lord will destroy your foe, and will make you vicegerents (inheritors, successors) in the earth, that He may see how you behave."
We punished Pharaoh's people with the years (of drought) and scarcity of fruit or crops), that per chance (or possibly) they might remember. 
But whenever good (times) came to them they said, "This is due to our effort." And if evil befell them, they ascribed it to the evil influences of Moses and those with him. Surely, the evil influence is only in the hands of Allah. But most of them know not.
And they said, "Whatever Sign you bring to enchant us, we will not put faith in you.”
So We sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the vermin and the frogs and the blood, - a succession of clear Signs. But they were inflated with arrogance, a guilty people.
And when there fell upon them the plague, they said, "O Moses! Call upon your Lord for us, as He has covenanted with you. Verily, if you do remove the plague from us, we will put our trust in you; and we will assuredly let the children of Israel go with you." 
But when We removed the penalty from them, according to an appointed term which they had to fulfil, lo! then they broke their promise. 
But We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our Signs, and were careless thereof. 
And We gave unto a people, despised and weak, an inheritance, lands in both east and west, lands which We had blessed. And the good promise of your Lord was fulfiled on the children of Israel, because they were patient and constant. And We utterly destroyed all the works which Pharaoh and his people had done and that which they had devised. 
And We passed the children of Israel safely across the sea. They came upon a people devoted to their idols, and said, "O Moses! Make for us a god as the gods they have." Said he, "Verily, you are ignorant people. 
"Verily, these people- destroyed shall be their way, and vain is that which they are doing."
He said, "Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, when He has preferred you above all creatures?"
And (remember) when We saved you from Pharaoh's people who wrought you evil woe, slaying your sons, and sparing your women. In that was a mighty trial from your Lord.
And We appointed for Moses thirty nights (of solitude), and added ten (more), and he completed the time appointed by his Lord for forty nights. And Moses said unto his brother Aaron, "Act for me amongst my people, and do what is right, and follow not the path of the evildoers."
And when Moses came to Our appointment, and his Lord spoke unto him, he said, "O my Lord! Show me Thyself, that I may look on Thee!" Allah said, "Thou canst not see Me; but look upon the mountain. If it remains steady in its place, you have seen Me;" But when his Lord appeared unto the mountain He made it dust, and Moses fell down in a swoon! And when he woke he said, "Glory unto Thee! I turn repentant unto Thee, and I am the foremost of those who believe."
He said, "O Moses! Verily, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words. Take then what I have brought you, and be of the thankful." 
And We wrote for him upon Tablets, admonitions, commanding and explaining everything, and said, "Hold fast to them, and bid your people take the best course, made clear therein. I will show you the abode of those who work abominations.
I will turn from My revelations those who wrongfully magnify themselves with pride in the earth; and though they see every Sign, they shall not believe therein, and if they see the path of rectitude they shall not take it for their path; but if they see the path of error they shall choose it for their path - that is because they deny Our revelations and have ignored them."
But those who deny Our revelations (or Signs) and the meeting of the Hereafter, in vain are their works. Shall they be rewarded save for that which they have done?
And the people of Moses, after he had left them, chose (for worship) an image of a lowing calf (or one that seemed to low) made out of their ornaments. Did they not see that it could not speak to them or guide them in the path? They chose it and became wrongdoers (or unjust, unreasonable, irrational, superstitious people).
But when they bit their hands (in realization and fear) and saw that they had gone astray, they said, "Verily, if our Lord have not compassion on us and forgive us we shall surely be of those who are lost!"
And when Moses returned unto his people angry and grieved, he said, "Evil is it that which you have done after I had gone! Would you hasten on the judgment of your Lord?". And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the (hair on his) head, dragging him towards him. But he (Aaron) protested, saying, "O son of my mother! Verily, the people deemed me weak (or of no account) and well nigh killed me. Make not mine enemies rejoice about me (my humiliation), and count me not with the unjust (evildoing, irrational) people.
Moses prayed, "O Lord! Forgive my brother and me and let us enter into Thy mercy; for Thou art the most merciful of the merciful. 
Verily, those who have taken to themselves a calf, there shall reach them wrath from their Lord, and abasement in the life of this world; for thus do we reward those who forge a lie. 
But those who have done bad works, and then turn again after them and believe - verily, your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful."
And when Moses' wrath calmed down he took up the Tables, in the inscription of which was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord.
And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment; and when the earthquake took them he prayed, "O my Lord! Had you willed, you could have destroyed both them and me before this. Will Thou destroy us for what the fools amongst us have done? This is naught but Thy trial, wherewith Thou dost lead astray whom Thou pleases and guides whom Thou please; Thou art our patron! Forgive us and have mercy on us, for Thou art the best of those who forgive!
And ordain for us good in this world, and in the Hereafter too; verily, we are guided unto Thee." He said, "With My punishment, I fall on whom I will; but My mercy embraces everything; and I will ordain it for those who do right, and practice charity regularly, and those who believe in our Signs. 
Those who follow the Messenger - the unlettered Prophet - whom they find mentioned in their own Law and Gospel. (Deuteronomy18 and Johnbidding them what is just (reasonable) and forbidding them what is wrong (evil, unreasonable, stupid); and making lawful for them what is good (pure), and making unlawful evil (impure) things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and yokes which were upon them. So it is those who believe in him and honour and help him and follow the Light which has been sent down with him - it is they who are the successful (or shall prosper)."
Say, "O you people! Verily, I am the Messenger of Allah unto you all, of Him whose is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth, there is no God but He! He gives life and death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered (or not learned, unsophisticated) prophet, - who believes in Allah and in His Words - then follow him that per chance (or possibly) you may be guided."
Amongst the people of Moses is a section who guide with truth, and thereby act justly.
And We divided them into twelve tribes, nation; and We inspired Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying, "Strike the rock with your staff!" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs, so that each tribe knew their drinking place. And We overshadowed them with the cloud; and sent down upon them the manna and the quails, saying, "Eat of the good things We have provided you with!"- They did not wrong Us but it was themselves they were wont to wrong.
And when it was said unto them, "Dwell in this city and eat there from (enjoy its facilities) as you will, and say "Repentance" and enter the gate prostrate (in humility); so will We forgive you your sins; We will increase (the portion or reward of) those who do right."
But those amongst them who did wrong changed the words given them for another saying; and We sent upon them a wrath from heaven for that they were unjust (or transgressed).
Ask them, too, about the city which stood by the sea, how they broke the Sabbath; how on the Sabbath day the fish came straight up to them; but on the days when they kept not the Sabbath, they came not to them. Thus did We try them for the evil that they wrought.
And when a community from amongst them said, "Why do you warn a people whom Allah would destroy, or punish with severe torment?" they said, "In order to do our duty to our Lord, that per chance (or possibly) they may fear (evil)."
But when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We saved those who forbade evil, and We overtook those who did wrong with grievous punishment because they transgressed.
But when they rebelled against what they were forbidden, We said to them, "Become you as apes, despised and spurned!"
And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed that He would surely raise against them till the Day of Resurrection, those who would lay on them grievous torment. Verily, your Lord is quick in retribution, but verily, He is also Forgiving, Merciful.
We broke them up into sections in the earth. Among them are some who are righteous, and among them are those who are the opposite. We have tried them with good things and with bad things, that per chance (or possibly) they may return (to Us).
But after them a generation succeeded them who inherited the Book (Scriptures)! They chose the vanities of this lower world, saying, "Everything will be forgiven us." But if similar vanities came to them again they would seize them too! Was there not taken from them a covenant by the Book, that they should not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? Yet they study what is therein! But the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear - do you not then understand? 
But those who hold fast by the Book and are steadfast in prayer - verily, We will not waste the wages of those who do right.
And when We shook the mountain over them, as though it were a covering, and they thought it would fall upon them, We said, "Take you what We have given you with firmness, and remember what is therein; per chance (or possibly) you may fear Allah."
And when your Lord drew forth from the children of Adam, out of their loins, their seed (or descendants), and made them testify about themselves, "Am I not your Lord?" They said, "Yea! We do bear witness" - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, "Verily, of this we were unaware." 
Or say, "Verily, our fathers associated others with Allah before us, and we were but their seed after them. Will you then destroy us for the futile deeds of the doers of futility (or vanities)?"
Thus do We explain the Signs that per chance (or possibly) they may return (or turn to Us).
Read to them the declaration of him to whom We brought our Signs, and who stepped away there from, and Satan followed him, and he became one of those who lead (tempt or are tempted to go) astray.
Had We pleased We would have exalted him thereby (with Our Signs), but he clung to the earth and followed his own lust, and his likeness was as the likeness of a dog, whom if you should attack he hangs out his tongue, or if you should leave him, hangs out his tongue too. Such is the likeness of the people who say our Signs (revelations) are lies. Tell them then these tales - per chance (or possibly) they may reflect.
Evil is the likeness of a people who deny Our revelations (or Signs) and wrong their own souls.
He whom Allah leads, he indeed is led aright, while he whom Allah sends astray, they are indeed losers.
We have created for hell many of the Jinn and of Mankind; they have heart and they discern not therewith; they have eyes and they see not therewith; they have ears and they hear not therewith; they are like cattle, nay, more misguided, for they are heedless (or care not).
But Allah belong the most beautiful names; call on Him then thereby, and leave those who pervert (profane or blaspheme against) His names. They shall be rewarded for that which they have done.
And of those whom We have created is a people who are guided with the truth and establish justice therewith.
But they who deny Our revelations We will bring them down by degrees from whence they know not.
I give them rein, for verily, my scheme is effective.
Do they not then reflect that their companion is not possessed? He is but a perspicuous Warner! 
Do they not behold the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth, and what things Allah has created, and (see that), it may well be that their term is already drawing to its end? In what after this then will they believe? 
He whom Allah leads astray there is no guide for him! He leaves them blindly wandering in their rebellion.
They will ask you about the (final) Hour, for what time it is fixed? - Say, "The knowledge thereof is only with my Lord; none shall manifest it at its time but He. Heavy is its burden in the heavens and the earth. It will come to you suddenly and unawares." They question you as though you were informed of it (or eagerly searching for it). Say," Knowledge thereof is with Allah only, but most people know not."
Say, "For myself I have no power to benefit, nor power to harm, save what Allah will. Had I knowledge of the Unseen I should surely have multiplied all that is good, and no adversity would touch me; I am but a Warner and a herald of good tidings unto a people who have faith."
He it is who created you from a single soul, and made there from its mate to dwell with her (in comfort and love); and when he covered her she bore a light burden, and went about therewith (unnoticed); but when it grew heavy they cried unto Allah, their Lord, saying, "Surely if you give us a well-formed child, we shall be forever thankful." 
But when He gave them both a well-formed child, they joined partners with Him with respect to that which He had given them. But Allah is exalted above that which they associate with Him.
Will they associate with Him those who cannot create aught, but are themselves created, 
And have no power to help them, nor can even help themselves?
But if you call them unto guidance they follow you not. It is all the same to them if you call them or if you hold your tongue.
Those whom you call on other than Allah are servants like yourselves. Call on them then, and let them answer you, if you are truthful. 
Have they feet to walk with? Or have they hands to hold with? Or have they eyes to see with? Or have they ears to hear with? Say, Call upon your (supposed) partners (of Allah); then plot against me, and spare me not.
"Verily, my patron (or protecting friend) is Allah, who reveals the Book, and He is the Friend of the righteous. 
But those whom you call on beside Him have no power to help you, nor can they help themselves." 
But if you call them unto the guidance, they hear not. You will see them looking at you, yet they see not. 
Hold to forgiveness, and command what is kind, and shun the ignorant.
And if an incitement from the devil wound you, then seek refuge in Allah: verily, He is Hearer and Knower.
Verily, those who fear Allah, if a temptation (suggestion, whisper) from the devil touches (assaults, troubles) them, they do but remember (or mention) Him, and lo! They see (realise).
And their brethren he shall increase in error, then they shall not desist.
If you bring them not a verse (of revelation) they say, "Have you not yet made choice of one? Say, "I only follow what is inspired in me by my Lord. These are lights (perceptions, insights) from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy to a people who have faith."
And when the Quran is read, then listen thereto with attention, and keep silence, that per chance (or possibly) you may obtain mercy.
And remember your Lord within yourself humbly and with awe, below your breath, in the morning and in the evening; and be not of those who are neglectful (or unheedful).
Verily, they who are with your Lord are not too big with pride (arrogant) for His service, but they praise and bow before Him in adoration.
They will ask you about the spoils of war. Say, "The spoils belong to Allah and the Messenger, so fear (keep your duty to) Allah and keep straight the relationship amongst yourselves; obey Allah and the Messenger if you do believe."
Verily, the believers are those who, when Allah's name is mentioned, their heart sinks with awe; and when His Signs (revelations) are recited to them they increase them in faith; and in their Lord do they trust.
Who are steadfast in worship, and spend of what We have bestowed upon them; 
These are in truth believers. For them are degrees of honour with their Lord, and forgiveness, and a generous provision.
Even as your Lord caused you to go forth from your house with the Truth, a sect of the believers were averse to it.
They disputed with you about the Truth after it was made plain, as though they were being driven on to visible death.
And when Allah promised you that one of the two troops (the army or the caravan) should be your s, and you yearned to have the unarmed one (the caravan). Allah wished to justify Truth by His words, and to cut off the root of the unbelievers.
That He might cause Truth to triumph and make Falsehood vain, despite the aversion of the guilty.
Remember when you asked for succour from your Lord, and He answered you, "I will assist you with a thousand angels, in many ranks."
Allah made it glad tidings only to reassure your heart therewith, for victory comes only from Allah! Verily, Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Remember when drowsiness covered you as a reassurance from Him, and He sent down upon you rain from heaven to purify you, to remove from you the plague of Satan, and to make strong your heart and firm your footsteps.
Remember when your Lord inspired the angels, saying, "Verily, I am with you; make you firm, then, those who believe; I will cast dread into the heart of the unbelievers; strike off their necks, and strike off their finger tip."
This is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger; for he who goes into opposition against Allah and His Messenger, verily, Allah is strict in punishment.
Thus (it will be said) "There, taste the punishment, for disbelievers is the torment of the Fire.
O you who believe! When you meet the disbelievers in hostile swarms, turn not to them your backs; 
For he who turns his back that day, save as a stratagem of war, or to retreat to his own troop, brings down upon himself the wrath of Allah, and his resort is Hell, an evil refuge.
It is not you who slew them, but it was Allah who slew them; nor was it you who threw (the dust to blind the enemy), but Allah who threw it to test the believers by goodly test from Himself; verily, Allah is Hearer, Knower.
That and also because Allah weakens the stratagem of the disbelievers.
(O unbelievers!) If you sought a judgment, a decision has now come to you. But if you desist, it will be better for you; but if you return to the attack, We, too will return. And your troop shall avail you nothing, however great in number it be, since Allah is with the believers!
O you who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger, and turn not from Him when you hear him speak.
Be not like those who say, "We hear," and yet they hear not.
Verily, the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf, the dumb who understand not. 
Had Allah known any good in them, He would have made them hear; but had He made them hear, they would have turned away, averse.
O you who believe! Respond unto Allah and His Messenger when He calls you to that which quickens you; and know that Allah comes in between a man and his own heart; and that He it is unto Whom you shall be gathered.
And fear temptation (or trial, chastisement, oppression, discord, chaos) which falls not exclusively on those of you who have done wrong; but know that Allah is severe in punishment.
Remember when you were few in number and weak in the land, fearing lest people should despoil and snatch you away; then He sheltered you and strengthened you with His aid, and provided you with good things, that per chance (or possibly) you may give thanks.
O you who believe! Be not treacherous to Allah and His Messenger; nor knowingly betray your trusts (obligations, duties, responsibilities in respect of wealth, property, confidences, knowledge, talents, time, opportunities, circumstances, power, social position, prestige etc. bestowed by other people, the community or by Allah.)
Know that your wealth and your children are but a test, and that with Allah is the highest wage.
O you who believe! If you fear (does your duty to) Allah He will give you discrimination (or a Criterion) and will rid you of your evil thoughts and deeds, and will forgive you; for Allah is Lord of Infinite Bounty.
And when those who disbelieved plotted against you to detain you in bonds, or slay you, or drive you forth - they plotted, but Allah also plotted, for Allah is best of Plotters.
But when Our verses were recited to them they said, "We have already heard. If We pleased We could speak like this; verily, this is nothing but tales of ancient folk."
When they said, "O Allah! If this be indeed truth from Thee, then rain down upon us stones from heaven or bring us grievous doom!"
But Allah would not torment them while you were amongst them; nor will He punish them while they seek forgiveness.
But what plea have they that Allah should not punish them when they turn folk away from the Sacred Mosque (The Kaaba), though they are not its fitting guardians? Its fitting guardians are only the righteous (those who keep their duty to Allah), but most of them know not.
Their prayer at the House was naught but whistling and hand clapping! Therefore, (it is said to them) Taste of the doom because you disbelieved!
Verily, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to turn folk away from the path of Allah; but they shall spend it, and then it shall become sighing (regret) for them, and then they shall be overcome. Those who disbelieve shall be gathered into hell! 
That Allah may separate the vile from the good, and may stack the vile on top of each others, and heap them together in hell! Such are the losers!
Tell those who disbelieve, that if they desist they will be forgiven what is past; but if they return (to evil ways) then the example of men of former days has already gone before them.
Fight them then until there be no more oppression, and that religion may be wholly Allah's. But if they desist, then Allah is Seer of what they do. 
But if they turn their backs, then know that Allah is your patron, the Supreme Patron, the Supreme Helper.
And know that whenever you seize anything as a spoil of war, to Allah belongs a fifth thereof, and to His Apostle, and to kindred and orphans, and the needy and the wayfarer; if you believe in Allah and what We have revealed unto Our servants on the Day of Discrimination (Testing or Decision between right and wrong), the day when the two armies met (the battle of Badr). And Allah has Power over all things.
When you were on the near side of the valley, and they were on the far side, and the camel caravan was below you, had you made an appointment then to meet, you would have failed to keep it. But it was otherwise, so that Allah might accomplish a thing that must be done (or was already decreed); that he who was to perish might perish on clear proof (either as a forewarning or to some other manifest purpose or cause); and that he who was to survive might survive on clear proof. Verily, Allah is Hearer, Knower.
Allah showed them unto you (Muhammad) in your dream as few in number. But had He shown them to you as many, you (Muslims) would have been timid (afraid), and you would have quarrelled about the matter. But Allah saved you from this. Verily, He knows well the secret of men's heart!
And when He showed them to you (Muslims), when you encountered them, as few in your eyes; and made you seem weak (or contemptible) in their eyes, it was that Allah might accomplish a thing that must be done (or was fore-ordained); for unto Allah do all things return!
O you who believe! When you encounter a force, then stand firm and remember Allah much, that you may be successful (or may prosper)!
And obey Allah and His Messenger, and dispute not with one another, lest you falter (or lose heart) and your strength (or powers or luck) depart, but be steadfast (patient and persevering), for verily, Allah is with the steadfast. 
And be not like those who went forth from their homes with insolence, and for appearance sake before men, and to turn away people from the way of Allah, for Allah surrounds all things.
And when Satan made their works appear seemly to them, and said, "There is none amongst mankind to conquer you to-day, for, verily, I am near you." But when the two armies came in sight of each other, he turned upon his heels (took flight) and said, "Verily, I am clear of you! Verily, I see what you see not! Verily, I fear Allah, for Allah is strict (or severe) in punishment!"
And when the hypocrites and those in whose heart is a disease said, "Their religion hath beguiled (hypnotized or deluded) these men." But he who puts his trust in Allah, verily, Allah is Mighty and Wise.
If you could see how the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve, smiting them on their faces and hinder parts, saying, "Taste you the torment of burning! 
This is for what your hands have sent on before you; and know that Allah is no tyrant to his servants."
Their deeds are like those of Pharaoh's people and those before them! They rejected the Signs (revelations) of Allah, and Allah overtook them in their sins. Verily, Allah is strong and severe in punishment.
That is because Allah is not one to change the favour He has bestowed on a people, until they first change what they have in themselves (in their own souls), and because Allah is Hearer and Knower.
Their way is like those of Pharaoh's people and those before them! They denied Our Signs (or revelations), and We destroyed them in their sins, and drowned Pharaoh's people. All were evildoers.
Verily, the worst of beasts in Allah's eyes are those who are ungrateful and will not believe; 
Those with whom if you make a treaty, they break their treaty at each opportunity, for they fear not (or keep not their duty to) Allah; 
Should you come to war with them, then deal with them so as to strike fear into those who come after them (as an example), that per chance (or possibly) they may remember.
And should you ever fear treachery from any people, then throw back to them their treaty in like manner (or in fairness); verily, Allah loves not the treacherous.
Let not those who disbelieve deem that they can outstrip (believers or Allah's purpose); verily, they cannot frustrate them (or escape).
Prepare you against them what strength of forces and horses you have to the utmost of your power, that thereby you may dismay the enemies of Allah, and your enemies, and others beside them whom you know not. You do not know them, but Allah knows them! Whatever you spend in the Way of Allah, it will be repaid you in full; and you shall not be wronged.
But if they incline to peace, incline you to it also, and trust in Allah; verily, He is Hearer and Knower.
But if they wish to betray (or deceive) you, then, verily, Allah is sufficient for you! He it is who supports you with His help and with the believers.
And attunes (or reconciles) their heart! If you had spent all that is in the earth you could not have attuned their heart, but Allah reconciled them, verily, He is Mighty and Wise!
O you Prophet! Sufficient unto you is Allah, and unto those of the believers who follow you! 
O you Prophet! Urge on the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty steadfast men, they shall overcome two hundred; if there be of you a hundred, they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people without understanding (or discernment).
Now has Allah made light your burden, for He knows that there is a weakness in you: but if there be amongst you but a steadfast hundred, they will vanquish two hundred; and if there be of you a thousand, they will vanquish two thousand, by the permission of Allah. Allah is with the steadfast.
It has not been for any Prophet to take captives until he hath subdued the land! You desire the lure of this world, but Allah desires the Hereafter, for Allah is Mighty, Wise!
Were it not for an ordinance from Allah that had gone before, there would have touched you a mighty punishment for that which you took (prisoners for ransom), 
Eat (enjoy, utilize) of what spoils you have taken, what is lawful and good; and fear Allah, verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you Prophet! Say to such of the captives as are in your hands, "If Allah knows of any good in your heart, He will give you better than that which is taken from you, and will forgive you; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
But if they desire to betray you - they have betrayed Allah before! - but He hath given you power over them; for Allah is Knower, Wise!
Verily, those who believe and have fled into exile (left their homes), and fought strenuously with their wealth and lives in the cause of Allah, and those who have given them refuge and help, these shall be kin (or friends and protectors) to each other. But those who believe, but have not fled into exile (left their homes); you have no duty to their claims of kindred, until they flee as well. But if they seek your aid in religion, then it is your duty to help them, except against a people between whom and you there is an alliance; for Allah is Seer of what you do.
And those who disbelieve, some of them are kin (or protectors) of one another - unless you act the same there will be confusion (or oppression) in the land, and great corruption (or mischief).
Those who believe and have left their homes and striven strenuously in the cause of Allah, and those who have given them a refuge and a help, these are the believers. For them is forgiveness and generous provision.
Those who accept faith later and leave their homes and strive strenuously with you, these are of you. But blood relations are nearer to one another in the Book of Allah (also called the Eternal Decree, the Preserved Tablet or it can be called the Universal Plan or Blue Print). Verily, Allah is Knower of all things.
An immunity from Allah and His Messenger to those idolaters with whom you have made a treaty (or alliance).
Travel freely in the land for four months, but know that you cannot make Allah helpless, and that Allah will confound (or humiliate) the disbelievers.
And a proclamation from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that Allah is free of obligations to the idolaters, as is His Messenger! If then you repent it is better for you; but if you turn your backs, then know that you cannot make Allah helpless (frustrate His plan). Give tidings of a grievous doom to those who disbelieve.
Except to those of the idolaters with whom you have made a treaty, and who then have not failed you, and have not supported any one against you. Fulfil for them then your treaty until its full term. Verily, Allah loves those who fear (the righteous, those who keep their duty to Him).
 9:5 But when the sacred months are past, then fight and slay the idolaters (those who plot against you) wherever you may find them; and seize them, and besiege them, and ambush them in every manner; but if they repent, and are steadfast in prayer, and practice charity, then let them go their way; for verily, Allah is oft Forgiving and Merciful.
And if any one of the idolaters ask you for protection (or asylum), then aid him, in order that he may hear the word of Allah; then let him reach his place of safety. That is because they are a folk who know not.
How can there be for the idolaters a treaty with Allah and with His Messenger, save those with whom you have made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque! Then while they stand by you, stand you by them; verily, Allah loves the righteous (those who fear evil).
How (can there be any treaty)! - for if they prevail against you, they respect neither ties of blood nor of agreements. They please you with their mouths while their heart refuse; and most of them work abomination (or are wicked and rebellious). 
They barter Allah's signs (or revelations) for a little price and they turn folk away from His way; verily, evil is that which they are wont to do.
They will not observe towards a believer ties of kindred nor ties of honour (or covenants); these are the transgressors.
But if they repent and establish regular prayer and practice regular charity, then they are your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations unto a people that have knowledge.
But if they break faith with you after their treaty, and assail (taunt or attack) your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief - verily, they have no faith - in order that they may desist.
Will you not fight a people who broke their solemn pledges, and intended to expel the Messenger and attacked you first? What! Fear you them? Allah is more deserving that you should fear Him if you be believers.
Fight them! Allah will chastise them by your hands, and disgrace them, and give you victory against them, and He will heal the breasts of a people who believe.
And He will remove rage from their heart; for Allah relents unto whomsoever He will. Allah is Knower, Wise!
Did you suppose that you would be left in peace, when Allah has not yet determined (tested) those of you who will strive, and who take none other than Allah and His Messenger, and the believers for protectors and friends? But Allah is well aware of what you do.
It is not for idolaters to tend the mosques of Allah, while bearing witness against the infidelity of their own souls; for such their works are vain, and in the Fire shall they dwell.
Only he shall tend the mosques of Allah who believes in Allah and the Last Day, and is steadfast in prayer, and practices regular charity, and fears none but Allah. Only these can be expected to be among those who are rightly guided.
Have you supposed that giving drink to the pilgrims and tending the Sacred Mosque are equal to believing in Allah and in the Last Day, and striving in the way of Allah? They are not equal in the sight of Allah, and Allah guides not a wrongdoing people.
Those who believe and who have left their homes (migrated) and striven with their wealth and with their lives in the way of Allah, are highest in rank in the sight of Allah. These are the triumphant.
Their Lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from Himself, and goodwill; and Gardens shall they have with enduring pleasure (or joy), 
There they shall abide forever. Verily, Allah, with Him is mighty reward.
O you who believe! Choose not your fathers, nor your brothers for patrons if they love disbelief rather than faith; for whoever amongst you takes them for patrons these are the wrong-doers.
Say, "If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your clansmen, and the wealth which you have gained, and the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings which you love, if all these are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving in His way: then wait awhile, until Allah brings His command to pass. Allah guides not wrong-doing (rebellious) people."
Allah has helped you in many fields, and on the day of Huneyn (where a Muslim army was ambushed) when you were pleased with your great numbers; but it availed you not at all, and the land grew too narrow for you where it had been broad; and you turned your backs retreating; 
Then Allah sent down His shechina (inner calm, peace, tranquillity, security reassurance) upon His Messenger and upon the believers; and sent down hosts which you could not see, and punished those who disbelieved; for that is the reward of the disbelievers.
Then Allah turns after that to whom He will, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful!
O you who believe! It is only the idolaters who are unclean; they shall not then approach the Sacred Mosque after this year. But if you fear poverty (from the loss of trade with them) then (know that) Allah will enrich you from His grace if He will; verily, Allah is Knower, Wise.
Fight those from amongst those to whom the Book has been brought, but who believe not in Allah and in the Last Day, and who forbid not what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, and who do not practice the Religion of Truth, until they are brought low and pay the Jizya (tribute, compensation, tax) readily.
The Jews say Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say that Christ is the son of Allah; that is what they say with their mouths, imitating the sayings of those who disbelieved before. Allah (Himself) fights against them! How perverse are they!
They take for lords rather than Allah their rabbis and their monks, and the Messiah the son of Mary; but they were bidden to worship only one Allah. There is no God but He. Be He glorified above all that they join with Him! (See Deuteronomy 5:7 and John6, 12)
They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah disdains all but that He should perfect His light, however averse to this the disbelievers may be!
He it is who sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth, to make it prevail over every other religion, however averse to this the disbelievers may be!
O you who believe! Verily, many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks devour the wealth of mankind openly, and turn away folk from the way of Allah; but those who store up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah, unto them give tidings of grievous doom! 
On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of hell, and their brows and their sides and their backs shall be branded therewith. "This is what you stored up for yourselves, taste then what you used to store."
Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months in Allah's Book, ordained on the day when He created the heavens and the earth. Of these four are sacred. That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves in them. But fight the idolaters one and all, as (or when) they fight you one and all, and know that Allah is with those who fear (restrain themselves).
Verily, postponement (of the sacred months) is but an addition of disbelief to lead astray therewith those who disbelieve. They make it lawful one year, but they make it unlawful in another, that they may make up the number of months which Allah has made sacred, to allow that which Allah has prohibited. Seemly to them are their evil works, but Allah guides not a misbelieving people.
O you who believe! What ailed you when you were told to march forth in Allah's way, that you were bowed down to the ground with heaviness? Were you content with the life of this world instead of the Hereafter? But the comforts of the life of this world is but a little compared to the Hereafter. 
Unless you march forth He will afflict you with grievous doom, and will choose instead of you a people different from you! You cannot harm Him at all, for Allah has Power to do all things.
If you do not help him (Muhammad), Allah will. (Remember) Allah did help him when those who disbelieved drove him forth, along with another (Abu Bakr). When the two were in the cave, he said to his comrade, "Fear not, verily, Allah is with us." (We are not merely two, He is the powerful third) Then Allah sent down His shechina (peace, reassurance) upon him, and aided him with hosts you could not see, and humbled the word of those who disbelieved, and exalted the word of Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
March you then, lightly or heavily equipped, and strive with your wealth and persons in the cause of Allah. That is best for you if you did but know!
Had there been an immediate gain, and an easy journey, they would have followed you; but the distance was too far for them; yet they will swear by Allah, "If we could, we would have gone forth with you." They destroy their own souls, but Allah knows that they lie!
Allah forgives you (O Muhammad); why did you give them leave (to stay) until it was made manifest to you who spoke the truth, and you did know the liars?
Those who believe in Allah and in the Last Day ask no leave of you from striving with their wealth and their lives; but Allah knows those who fear (do their duty).
It is only those who believe not in Allah and in the Last Day who beg leave from you, and those whose heart have doubts, and in their doubt do waver.
Had they wished to go forth, they would certainly have prepared some equipment; but Allah was averse from their being sent forth, and held them back, and they were told "Sit you with the inactive (sedentary or passive)." 
Had they gone forth with you they would have made you naught but more trouble, and they would have hurried about amongst you creating a sedition; and amongst you are some who would have listened to them; but Allah knows those who are evil-workers.
They used to crave sedition before and upset your affairs, until the Truth came, and Allah's decree was made manifest, much to their aversion (disgust, consternation).
Of them are some who say, "Grant me exemption, and draw me not into trial (or temptation (of the beauty of the enemy women))" Have they not fallen into the trial already, but Hell surrounds the disbelievers.
If good befall you it also afflicts (or grieves) them; but if a calamity befall you they say, "We took precautions." and they turn away well pleased (or rejoicing).
Say, "Naught befalls us save what Allah has written down for us; He is our Patron. In Allah let believers trust!"
Say, "Can you expect for us aught but one of the two best things (martyrdom or victory)? We too expect that Allah will afflict on you with doom from Himself or by our hands. Wait then, and verily, we are waiting with you!"
Say, "Spend (for the Cause), willingly or unwillingly, it shall not be accepted from you; for verily, you are a people who are rebellious and wicked."
But naught hinders their contributions from being accepted save that they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, and perform not prayer save lazily (unmindfully), and spend not in charity save reluctantly.
Let not their wealth nor their children please you. Allah only wishes to punish them therewith in the life of this world, and that their souls may pass away while still they disbelieve.
They swear by Allah that, in truth, they are of you; but they are not of you, and they are a people who do stand aside in fear. 
Could they but have found a refuge, or some caves, or a hiding place in which to creep, thither would they have rushed (jamaha = hastened with uncontrollable urgency, madly, obstinately).
Of them are some who defame you, with respect to (the distribution of) charity; though if they are given a part thereof, they are content; and if they are not given a part thereof, then are they enraged. 
Would that they were content with what Allah and His Messenger had brought them, and would say, "Allah is sufficient for us! Allah will bring us of His Bounty, and so will His Messenger; verily, in Allah is our hope (or desire)."
Alms are only for the poor and needy, and those who work for them, and those whose heart are to be reconciled (to be converted to Islam), and those in captivity, and those in debt, and those who are on Allah's path, and for the wayfarer. This is an ordinance from Allah, for Allah is Knower, Wise.
And of them are some who are at the ears of the prophet (they molest him), and say, "He is all ears (he listens to every one's plea)." Say, "He is an ear (or Hearer) of what is good for you, who believes in Allah, has faith in (or is true) to believers, and is a mercy unto such of you as truly believe." But those who molest the Messenger of Allah, for them is grievous woe!
They swear by Allah to please you (Muslims); but Allah and His Messenger are more worthy for them to please (or it is more fitting to please them or they have more right to it) if they be believers. 
Know they not that whoever sets himself against Allah and His Messenger, for him is the Fire of Hell, to dwell therein? That is the mighty shame!
The hypocrites fear lest there be revealed against them a verse, exposing what is in their heart. Say, "Mock ye! Verily, Allah is disclosing what you fear!"
But if you should ask them, they will say, "We did but talk and jest." Say, "Was it at Allah and His revelations, and His Messenger, that you mocked?"
Make no excuse! You have disbelieved after your (confession of) faith; if We forgive one party of you, We will punish another party because they were guilty.
The hypocrites, men and women, are of each other (influence, and agree with, each other, are tied together), bidding what is wrong and forbidding what is right, and they clench their hands (in anger to withhold charity, assistance, or power in the cause of Allah). They forget Allah, so He has forgotten (ignored) them! Verily, the hypocrites are the doers of abomination (rebellious and perverse).
Allah has promised unto the hypocrites, men and women, and unto the disbelievers, hell-fire to dwell therein. It is enough for them! Allah shall curse them, and theirs shall be an enduring woe.
You are like those who were before you. They were stronger than you and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their portion awhile, and you will enjoy your portion awhile just as they enjoyed their portion before you. And you indulge in idle chatter as they indulged in idle chatter. Such are they whose works are vain in this world and the Hereafter. Such are the losers.
Did there not come to them the story of those who were before them? Of the people of Noah and A'ad and Thamud, and of the people of Abraham, and the people of Midian? And of their overthrown cities? Their messengers came to them with manifest signs; for Allah surely wrongs them not, but it was themselves that they wronged.
And the believers, men and women, are patrons one of the others; they bid what is right, and forbid what is wrong, and are steadfast in worship, and give in charity, and they obey Allah and His Messenger. On these will Allah have mercy; verily, Allah is Mighty, Wise!
Allah has promised to believers, men and women, Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein; and goodly places in the Gardens of Bliss (Eden), But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure (or acceptance) of Allah. That is the Supreme Triumph!
O you Prophet! Strive strenuously against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern against them; for their ultimate resort is hell, an evil destination indeed.
They swear by Allah they did not speak wrong, but they did speak the word of disbelief (blasphemy); and they disbelieved after their Surrender (embracing Islam). And they plotted what they could not attain; and they only sought revenge after Allah through His Messenger had enriched them with His Grace. If they repent again it will be better for them; but if they turn their backs, Allah will afflict them with mighty woe in this world and in the Hereafter, nor shall they have upon the earth a friend or protector.
And of them are some who make a treaty with Allah, saying, "If He give us of His bounty, we will give alms and become of the righteous."
But when He gave them of His grace they hoarded it, and turned away, averse. 
So He caused hypocrisy to pursue them in their heart unto the day when they shall meet Him, for they did break their promises to Allah and because they lied.
Do they not know that Allah knows their secrets and their whisperings, and that Allah knows the Unseen?
Those who defame such of the believers as willingly give their alms, and such as can find nothing to give but their exertions and who mock at them - Allah Himself mocks them. Theirs is a grievous woe!
Ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness for them; if they should ask forgiveness for them seventy times, yet would not Allah forgive them; that is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and Allah guides not a people who work abomination. 
Those who were left behind rejoiced in staying behind the Messenger of Allah, and were averse to striving with their wealth and their persons in the way of Allah, and said, "March not forth in the heat." Say, "The fire of hell is hotter still, if you could but discern!"
Let them then laugh a little, they will weep much, as a recompense for that which they have earned!
But if Allah brings you back (from a campaign) to a party of them, and they ask you then for permission to come out with you, say, "You shall by no means ever come out with me, nor shall you ever fight a foe with me! Verily, you were content to sit at home the first time, sit you then now with the useless." 
Pray not ever for any one of them who dies, and stand not by his grave; verily, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died workers of perverse rebellion.
Let not their wealth and their children please you. Allah only wishes to punish them therewith in this world, and that their souls may pass away while they disbelieve.
Whenever a verse is sent down to them, saying "Believe you in Allah, and strive along with His Messenger," the men of wealth will ask you for leave to stay at home and say, "Let us be amongst those who stay behind." 
They are content to be with those who are useless, and a seal is set upon their heart that they understand not.
But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and with their lives. Such are they who shall have good things. Such are they who are successful (or prosper).
Allah has prepared for them Gardens beneath which river flow, to dwell therein; that is the supreme triumph.
There were among the desert Arabs some who had excuses and came to claim exemption, and those who lied to Allah and His Messenger sat at home inactive. There shall befall those of them who disbelieved, a mighty woe.
For the weak, and the sick, and those who cannot find wherewith to spend in alms, no blame is there for them, so long as they be sincere towards Allah and His Messenger. There is no blame against those who do good; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. 
Nor against those to whom, when they came to you that you should provide mount for them, you did say, "I cannot find whereon to mount you." They turned their backs while their eyes poured forth with tears, for grief that they could not find the means to spend.
There is blame only against those who ask you for leave to stay at home while they are rich; content to be with the useless. Allah has sealed their heart so that they know not.
They make excuses to you when you return to them. Say, "Make no excuse, we believe you not; Allah has informed us concerning you. Allah sees your works and so does His Messenger. Then shall you be brought back unto Him who knows the invisible (hidden) as well as the visible (open), and He shall inform you of the truth of that which you used to do.
They will swear by Allah unto you when you have returned to them, that you may leave them alone. Let them be, for verily, they are polluted (unclean), and their resort is hell, a recompense for that which they have earned!
They will swear unto you that you may accept them; but if you accept them, Allah, verily accepts not a people who work abomination.
The wandering Arabs of the desert are keener in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely to be ignorant of the limits that Allah has revealed unto His Messenger. Allah is Knower and Wise.
And of the wandering Arabs of the desert are some who take what they spend (in the cause of Allah) to be a loss (or a fine, punishment), and they wait for a turn of fortune against you; but the turn of evil fortune shall be against them. Allah is Hearer and Knower.
And of the wandering Arabs of the desert are some who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and who take what they spends to be a means of bringing them nearer to Allah and obtaining the Messenger's prayers. Verily it is an acceptable offering for them. Allah will bring them into His mercy. Verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
As for the Foremost in the way, the first of the Muhajirin (those who migrated into exile from Mecca to Medina), and the Ansar (those in Medina who helped them), and those who followed them in their kindness, Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him; He has prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever; that is the Supreme Triumph.
And of those of the wandering Arabs of the desert who are round about you, some are hypocrites, and some of the people of Medina persist in hypocrisy; you do not know them. We know them, and We will chastise them twice; then shall they be sent off into mighty woe.
And there are others who have acknowledged their sins. They have mixed a righteous action with another that was evil. It may be that Allah will relent towards them. Verily, Allah is Relenting and Merciful.
Take alms from their wealth, so that you may purify them and make them grow thereby; and pray for them; verily, your prayer is a source of security for them. Allah is Hearer and Knower.
Know they not that Allah is He who accepts repentance from His servants and takes the alms; and that Allah is He who is easily Relenting and Merciful.
And say, "Act! Allah will see your action, and so will His Messenger and the believers, and you will be brought back to Him who knows the seen and the unseen (or the visible and invisible), and He shall inform you of that which you used to do.
And there are others who are in hopes of Allah's decree; whether He will punish them, or whether He will forgive them. Allah is Knower, Wise.
And there are those who have chosen a place of worship (or mosque) for mischief and infidelity, in order to cause dissent amongst the believers, and for an outpost for those who made war against Allah and His Messenger in the past; they surely swear, "We only wished for what was good;" but Allah bears witness that they are liars.
Never stand up (to pray) therein. The place of worship (or mosque) founded on piety (or duty to Allah) from the first day, is more worthy that you should stand (to pray) therein, wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah does love those who purify.
Is he who has laid his foundation upon the fear of (duty to) Allah and of His good pleasure better, or he who has laid his foundation upon a crumbling undermined sand cliff, which crumbles away with him into the fire of hell? Allah guides not a people who do wrong.
The building which they have built will not cease to be a source of doubt in their heart until their heart are cut asunder; but Allah is Knowing, Wise.
Verily, Allah hath bought of the believers their lives and their wealth, because the Garden will be theirs; they shall fight in the way of Allah, and they shall slay and be slain, a promised binding on Him in Truth, in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran; and who is more faithful to His covenant than Allah? Rejoice then in the covenant which you have made with Him, for that is the supreme triumph.
Triumphant are those who repent, those who serve Him, those who praise, those who fast, those who bow down, those who fall down prostrate (in awe or surrender), those who bid what is right and forbid what is wrong, and those who keep the limits (ordained) of Allah - glad tidings to those who believe.
It is not for the prophet and those who believe to ask forgiveness for the idolaters, even though they are their kindred, after it has been made manifest to them that they are the fellows of hell.
Nor was Abraham's asking pardon for his father aught else but through a promise he had promised him; but when it was made manifest to him that he was an enemy to Allah, he cleansed himself of him (dissociated himself); verily, Abraham was soft of heart, forbearing.
Nor will Allah lead astray a people after He has guided them until that is made clear to them that which they have to fear (avoid). Verily, Allah is aware of all things.
Verily, Allah, To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth! He quickens and He slays. And you have beside Allah no protecting friend or helper.
Allah has now turned in mercy towards the Prophet and to the Muhajirin (those who migrated with him into exile), and towards the Ansar (helpers) who followed him in the hour of difficulty. After the heart of a party of them had well-nigh swerved aside, then He turned unto them in mercy. Verily, to them He is full of compassion and mercy.
And also unto the three who were left behind. When the earth, vast as it is, seemed too small for them, and their souls were constricted for them until they perceived that there was no refuge for them from Allah save towards Him (they felt imprisoned in their guilt and remorse). Then He turned again towards them that they might also repent. Verily, Allah, He is the Relenting, the Merciful.
O you who believe! Fear (do your duty to) Allah and be with those who are True (in word, thought, motivation and deed).
It was not fitting for the people of Medina and for those around them of the wandering Arabs of the desert, to stay behind the Messenger of Allah and prefer their lives to his. That is because neither thirst, nor toil, nor heat, nor hunger befell them on Allah's way, nor do their acts anger the disbelievers, or they receive injury from the enemy, but a good deed is recorded for them. Verily, Allah wastes not the wages of those who do good.
Nor do they spend in alms a small or great amount, nor do they cross a valley, but it is recorded for them, that Allah may repay them with better than that which they have done.
The believers should not march forth altogether. If a section from every troop remain behind, then they could devote themselves to gaining sound knowledge of their religion and teach their people when they return to them, that per chance (or possibly) they may beware of evil.
O you who believe! Fight those disbelievers who are near to you, and let them find in you sternness; and know that Allah is with those who fear (do their duty).
And whenever a verse is sent down, there are some of them who say (sarcastically), "Which of you has thus increased in faith?" But as for those who believe, it does increase their faith, and they shall rejoice.
But as for those in whose heart is a disease, it only adds wickedness to their wickedness, and they die disbelievers.
Do they not see that they are tried once or twice in every year? Yet they do not turn in repentance, nor do they heed.
And whenever a surah (verse) is sent down, some of them look at the others, (as if to say), "Does any one see you?" (i.e. furtively to make sure their guilt is not observed) Then they turn away! Allah has turned their heart, for that they are a people who discern not.
There has come to you a Messenger from amongst yourselves; hard for him to bear is it that you should perish (from iniquity); full of concern for you, for believers full of compassion, merciful.
But if they turn their backs, then say, "Allah is sufficient for me! There is no Allah but He! In Him do I trust. He is Lord of the Supreme Throne."
ALIF LAM RA. 
These are the Ayats (signs or verses) of the Book of Wisdom (or Wise Scripture)! 
Is it a wonder for mankind that We inspired a man from amongst themselves, saying "Warn you mankind; and give glad tidings to those who believe, that for them there are lofty ranks with their Lord?" The disbelievers say, "Verily, this is an obvious sorcerer!"
Verily, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six Days (or Periods, Ages, Cycles); then He established (or ascended) Himself firmly on the Throne (of Authority), to govern (direct, regulate) all things; there is no intercessor, except after His permission. This is Allah, your Lord! Therefore, worship (serve) Him. Will you not remind (or praise in thought and action, remember, remain aware)?
Unto Him is your return, all of you. It is the promise of Allah in truth. Verily, He produces creation, then He reproduces it, that He may recompense with justice those who believe and do what is right; but those who disbelieve, for them is a drink of boiling water, and grievous woe, for that they did disbelieve.
He it is who made the sun a glorious brightness (splendour), and the moon for a light, and decreed for it measured stages, that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning. Allah created not all this but in truth. He details the signs (or revelations) unto a people who understand.
Verily, in the alternation of night and day, and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, are signs unto a people who fear Him (are in awe or ward off evil).
Verily, those who expect not for the meeting with Us, and are content with the life of this world, and are comforted (or secure) therein, and those who are neglectful of our Signs (or revelations),
Their resort is the Fire because of that which they have earned!
Verily, those who believe and act righteously, their Lord guides them by their faith; beneath them shall rivers flow in the Gardens of Delight.
Their cry therein shall be, "Glory be to Thee, O Allah!" and their salutation therein shall be, "Peace!" and the end of their cry shall be, "Praise be to Allah, the Lord (Cherisher and Sustainer) of the Worlds!"
And if Allah should hasten for men the evil they earn, as they would fain hasten on the good, their respite would surely have expired. But We suffer those who look not for (or expect not) the meeting with Us to wander blindly on in their rebellion.
When misfortune touches man, he calls Us, whether reclining, sitting or standing; but when We have removed from him his distress, he passes on as though he had not called on Us because of the misfortune that touched him. Thus unto the extravagant is made seemly that which they have done.
We have already destroyed generations before you when they did wrong, and there came to them their Messengers with manifest signs, but they would not believe. Thus do We reward the guilty people.
Then We made you Vicegerents (or their successors) in the earth after them, that We may see how you will act.
But when Our evident Signs (revelations) are recited to them, those who expect not the meeting with Us say, "Bring a Lecture (Quran) other than this; or change it." Say, "It is not for me to, change it of my own accord; I do not follow aught but what I am inspired with. Verily, I fear, if I rebel against my Lord, the retribution of an awful Day!"
Say, "Had Allah willed, I should not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I dwelt amongst you a lifetime before it came to me; have you not then any sense?"
Who does greater wrong than he who forges a lie concerning Allah, or denies His revelations? Verily, the guilty are never successful.
They worship beside Allah what can neither harm them nor profit them, and they say, "These are our intercessors with Allah!" Say, "Will you inform Allah of something that He knows not in the heavens or the earth?" Praised be He, and exalted be He, above all that they associate with Him!
Mankind were but one nation once, then they disagreed; and had it not been for a Word (decree) from your Lord which had already gone out, their differences would have been settled between them already.
They say, "If only a sign had been sent down upon him from his Lord?" Say, "The unseen belongs only to Allah; but wait you for a while. Verily, I, too, am waiting with you!"
When We have let men taste of mercy after some adversity which has afflicted them, behold! They use a plot against Our revelations! Say, "Allah is quicker at plotting. Verily, Our Messengers (angels) write down that which you plot."
He it is who makes you travel in the land and sea, until when you are in the ships, and these carry them afloat with a favourable wind, and they rejoice therein, there comes to them a violent wind, and there comes to them a wave from every side, and they deem that they are overwhelmed, then they call on Allah, sincere in religion towards Him, praying, "If you deliver us from this, we will truly be of the thankful." 
But when He has delivered them, behold! They are rebellious in the earth unjustly; - O mankind! Your rebelliousness is only against yourselves. You have but a brief provision in the life of this world, then unto Us is your return, and We will inform you of that which you used to do.
Verily, the likeness of the life of this world is like water which We send down from the sky, and the plants of the earth, from which men and cattle eat, are mingled therewith, until when the earth puts on its ornament and is adorned, and her people think that they are her masters, Our commandment comes to it by night or day, and We make it as it were mown down corn, as though it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do We detail the signs unto a people who reflect.
Allah calls unto the abode of peace, and guides whom He will into the Straight Way (i.e. True Religion or The Surrender, Islam).
To those who do what is good, (is granted) goodness and increase! Neither does darkness nor abasement cover their faces! Such are Companions of the Garden (Paradise); they will dwell therein.
But, as for those who have earned ill, the reward of evil is the like thereof; abasement (ignominy) shall cover them - They shall have none to protect them against Allah - as though their faces were veiled with the deep darkness of the night. Such are the Companions of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein.
And on the day when We gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated other gods (with Us), "To your places, you and your associates!" and We will separate them; and their associates will say, "It was not us you worshipped"
"But Allah is witness enough between us and you, that we were unaware of your worship." 
There shall every soul experience what it did (or has sent on) before; and they shall be returned unto Allah, their rightful Lord, and that which they used to invent shall fail them.
Say, "Who provides you from the heaven and the earth? Who has power over hearing and sight? And who brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living? And who governs all affairs (or regulates, directs the course of events)?" And they will say, "Allah." Then say, "Do you not then fear (be pious or dutiful)?"
Such, then, is Allah, your true Lord! What is there after the truth but error? How then can you turn away?
Thus is the Word of your Lord justified against those who commit abomination (or rebel) - verily, they believe not. 
Say, "Is there any of your associates who can originate a creation and then reproduce it?" Say, "Allah produces creation, then reproduces it. How then are you misled (deluded)?" 
Say, "Is there any of your associates who guides unto the truth?" Say, "Allah guides unto the truth." Is then He who guides unto the truth more worthy to be followed, or he that guides not except he is himself guided? What ails you then, how judge you?
But most of them follow naught but conjecture (suspicion, fancy, guesswork, speculation); verily, conjecture can by no means take the place of (or avail against) truth. Verily, Allah is Aware of what they do.
This Quran could not have been devised by any beside (or in opposition to) Allah; but it is a confirmation (or verification) of that which came before it, and a fuller explanation of the Book (Scriptures, or that which was decreed for mankind) - there is no doubt therein - from the Lord of the Worlds.
Do they say, "He hath devised it"? Say then, "Bring a surah (chapter) like it, and call, if you can, on other than Allah, if you are truthful!"
Yet they call that a lie the knowledge of which they cannot compass, even before its Taawil (interpretation, elucidation, explanation, fulfilment, effects) has reached them. Thus did those before them make charges of falsehood. But see what was the consequence for the unjust!
Of them are some who believe therein; and of them are some who do not believe therein; but your Lord is best aware of the corrupters.
But if they deny you, say, "I have my work, and you have your work; you are innocent of what I work, and I am innocent of what you work."
There are some of them who listen to you. But can you make the deaf to hear, when they have no understanding (or sense)? 
And of them are some who look at you. But can you guide the blind, though they cannot see?
Verily, Allah wrongs not man in aught, but men do wrong themselves. 
And on the day when We will gather them together, it will be as though they had not stayed save an hour of the day. They shall know each other. Lost will be those who denied the meeting with Allah, and were not guided!
Whether We show you something of that which We promised them, or whether We will take you to Ourself, still unto Us is their return; and Allah is also a witness to what they do.
To every people was sent a Messenger; and when their Messenger comes to them (on the Day of Judgment), it will be judged between them fairly, and they will not be wronged.
But they say, "When will this promise come to pass, if you tell the truth?"
Say, "I have no power to harm or profit myself (or I have no power myself to harm or profit), save what Allah wills. Every nation has its appointed time; when their appointed time comes to them they cannot delay it for an hour or hasten it."
Say, "Have you considered, when His punishment comes to you, by night or day, which portion thereof will the sinners wish to hasten? 
And when it has fallen on you, will you believe in it. What! Believe now, when you wished to hasten it through unbelief. 
Then shall it be said to those who have done wrong, "Taste you the torment of Eternity! Are you recompensed except for that which you have earned? "
They will ask you to inform them whether it be true. Say, "Yea, by my Lord! Verily, it is the truth, nor can you escape."
Every soul that has done wrong, if it had whatever is in the earth, would seek to ransom itself therewith. They will utter their repentance when they see the torment; but it shall be decided between them with justice, nor shall they be wronged.
Is it not the case that to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth? Is it not the case that the promise of Allah is certainly true? But most of them understand not.
Is it He Who gives life and He Who takes it, and unto Him shall you all be returned?  
O mankind! There has come to you a direction (guidance, exhortation) from your Lord, and a healing for the disease in your breasts, and a guidance and a mercy for believers.
Say, "In the grace of Allah and in His mercy let them rejoice!" It is better than that (wealth) which they hoard.
Say, "See you what Allah has sent down to you for sustenance? Yet you have made some unlawful and some lawful. Say, "Has Allah permitted you, or do you invent lies concerning Allah?
What will those who invent lies concerning Allah think on the Day of Resurrection? Verily, Allah is truly Bountiful towards mankind, but most of them give no thanks!
Thee (Muhammad) are not occupied with any business, nor recite you a lecture from this Scripture, and you (mankind) perform no act, but We are Witness when you are engaged therein: nor does the weight of an atom escape your Lord in the earth or in heaven; nor is there less or greater than that, but it is written in the Perspicuous Book.
Behold! Verily, the friends of Allah are those on whom fear comes not, nor shall they grieve?
They who believe and who fear (do their duty to Allah)
For them are good tidings in the life of this world, and in the Hereafter - There is no changing the words of Allah! - That is the Supreme Triumph!
Let not their speech grieve you; verily, power belongs wholly to Allah. He is the Hearer and Knower.
Lo! Is it not unto Allah that belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth? What then do they follow who call on associates other than Allah? Verily, they follow nothing but fantasy, and verily, they do naught but lie (or guess).
He it is who made for you the night, that you might rest therein, and the day to see therein; in that, verily, are signs unto a people who heed.
They say, "Allah has taken to Himself a son." Glorified be He! He is Self-sufficient! His is whatever is in the heavens, and whatever is in the earth. You have no warrant for this! Do you say about Allah, that which you know not?
Say, "Verily, those who invent a lie concerning Allah will not succeed."
A brief provision in this world, then unto Us is their return! Then will We make them taste a dreadful doom because they disbelieved.
Recite to them the story of Noah, when he said to his people, "O my people! If my stay with you and my reminding you of the signs of Allah, be offensive to you, yet in Allah do I put my trust. So decide on your course of action, you and your associates; nor let your agreement be in the dark (dubious or secret); then decide respecting me, and do not delay. 
But if you turn your backs, (remember) I asked you not for wages; my wages are only due from Allah, and I am bidden to be of those who Surrender (i.e. accept Islam)"
But they called him a liar; and We saved him, and those with him, in the ark; and We made them Vicegerents (successors, agents, inheritors), and drowned those who had denied Our revelations. See then the nature of the consequences for those who had been warned!
Then We raised up after him messengers unto their people, and they also came to them with manifest signs; but they would not believe in what they had called a lie before. Thus do We set a stamp upon the heart of the transgressors.
Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs; but they were too inflated with pride, and were a guilty people.
And when the truth came to them from Us they said, "This is mere magic."
Moses said, "Speak you thus about the Truth when it comes to you? Is this magic? But magicians thrive not."
They said, "Have you come to turn us away from the faith in which we found our fathers, that there may be for you twain grandeur in the land? We will not believe you."
And Pharaoh said, "Bring me every expert sorcerer;" 
And when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, "Cast the spells you have to cast." 
And when they had cast, Moses said, "What you have brought is certainly sorcery. Verily, Allah will make it vain; Verily, Allah upholds not the work of mischief makers."
But Allah verifies (or proves and establishes) the Truth by His Words, however much the guilty are averse.
But none believed in Moses, save a section of his own people, through fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest he should afflict them. Verily, Pharaoh was a tyrant in the land, and verily, he was wanton.
And Moses said, "O my people! If you did believe in Allah, then on Him rely, if you have, indeed, surrendered (unto Him - become Muslims)."
They said, "In Allah do we put our trust. O our Lord! Make us not a cause of fitnat (trial, temptation, punishment, oppression, discord, conflict), for a people who oppress.
But deliver us by Thy mercy from the people who disbelieve!"
And We inspired Moses and his brother thus, "Establish, you twain, houses for your people in Egypt; and make you your houses a qiblah (the centre of worship); and be you steadfast in prayer, and give Glad Tidings to those who believe."
Moses said, "O our Lord! Verily, Thou hast brought to Pharaoh and his chiefs ornaments and wealth in the life of this world; Our Lord! They lead men astray from Thy way thereby! Our Lord! Confound their wealth (make it loathsome or turn it into a source of repulsion) and harden their heart that they may not believe until they see the grievous doom." 
He said, "Your prayer is answered; be upright then (follow the Straight Way), you two, and follow not the path of those who have no knowledge (the ignorant)."
And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh and his hosts pursued them with spite and hostility until when drowning overtook him, he exclaimed, "I believe that there is no Allah but He in whom the children of Israel believe, and I am of those who surrender (unto Him, become Muslim)!"
"What! Now! But a little while before were you in rebellion, and were of those who do evil; 
"But this day shall We save you in your body, that you may be a Sign to those who come after you; but verily, many of mankind are heedless of Our Signs!"
And We established the Children of Israel in a secure abode, and We provided them with good things; and they disagreed not until knowledge had come unto them. Verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that whereon they dispute.
And if you are in doubt of that which We have revealed unto you, ask those who read the Book before you; verily, the truth has come to you from your Lord. So be not you of those who doubt. 
And be not of those who reject the Signs of Allah, for then you will be of the losers.
Verily, those against whom the word of your Lord has been pronounced will not believe, 
Even though there come to them every sign, until they see the grievous doom. 
If only there were a community that had believed and profited from its faith. But none did except the people of Jonah. When they believed We removed from them the Torment of Disgrace in this world, and We gave them provision for a while. 
But had your Lord willed, all who are in the earth would have believed together. Would you force men to become believers?
It is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of Allah; He sets uncleanness on those who have no sense.
Say, "Behold what is in the heavens and in the earth! But Signs and Warners avail not a people who do not believe."
What expect they but the like of the days of those who passed away before them? Say, "Wait you then! Verily, I, too, will wait with you." 
Then will We save Our Messengers and those who believe, as is fitting to Us, in like manner as before.
Say, "O mankind! If you are in doubt concerning my religion, (know that) I will not worship those you worship other than Allah; but I worship Allah, who takes you to Himself, and I have been commanded to be of the believers!" 
And, set your purpose resolutely for religion as a "Hanif" (a man upright by nature); and be not of the idolaters; 
And call not besides Allah on what can neither profit you nor harm you; for if you do, verily, you are then of the wrong-doers (or unjust)."
And should Allah touch you with harm, there is none to remove it save He; and if He wish you well, there is none to repel His grace; He makes it fall on whom He will of His servants; for He is Forgiving and Merciful.
Say, "O mankind! There has come to you the Truth from your Lord, and he who is guided by it, his guidance is only for his own soul; and he who errs, errs only against it; and I am not a warder over you."
Follow what is inspired in you, and be patient until Allah judges, for He is the best of judges.
ALIF LAM RA. This is a Book whose signs (verses) are perfected (confirmed, fundamental and well-established) and then expounded (explained in detail), from the Wise One, the Aware: 
(Saying,) " Serve (or worship) none other than Allah. Verily, I am unto you from Him a Warner and a herald of Glad Tidings.
"Seek pardon from your Lord, then turn to Him repentant. He will cause you to enjoy a good provision until an appointed time. He gives of His Bounty (or Grace) to every one deserving it. But if you turn your backs, I fear for you the retribution of an Awful Day.
"Unto Allah is your return, and He has power over all things."
Do they not, verily, fold up their breasts, that they may hide (their thoughts) from Him? But when they cover themselves with their garments, does He not know what they conceal and what they display? Verily, He knows the nature of men's heart.
There is no creature that walks upon the earth but its provision is from Allah. He knows its permanent settlement and its temporary resting-place. All is in the Perspicuous Book (or in a Clear Record).
He it is who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His Throne (or authority, control) was (first) upon the Water that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct. But should you say, "You will be raised up after death," those who disbelieve will surely say, "This is naught but obvious magic."
And if We delay from them the doom to a stated time, they will surely say, "What hinders it?" Verily, on the day it comes to them there is no averting it from them and that which they mocked shall close in on them.
And if We make man taste of mercy from Us and then strip it off from him, verily, he is despairing, ungrateful;
And if We make him taste of comfort after distress has touched him, he will surely say, "All evils have departed from me." Verily, then he is exultant and boastful.
Save those who are patient and do right; these, for them is pardon and a mighty reward.
Perchance you forsake part of what is revealed to you, and your breast is straitened thereby, lest they should say, "Why is not a treasure sent down to him? Or why did not an angel come with him?". But you are only a Warner. It is Allah who is in charge of all things.
Or they say, "He hath invented it." Say, "Bring ten surahs (chapters) like it, invented; and call upon all whom you can beside Allah, if you are truthful." 
"And if they (false gods, Muses) do not answer, then know that it is revealed by the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no God but He. Do you then Surrender (unto Allah and accept Islam)?
Whoever shall desire the life of this world and its pomp (or ornaments), We will pay them their works therein, and they shall not be cheated.
These are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter save the Fire; and vain is that they made therein, and fruitless what they were doing!
Is he (like them) who relies upon a manifest Sign from his Lord and a witness from Him recites it, and of which the book of Moses came as a model and a mercy before it? These believe in it; and whoever of the tribes disbelieves in it, the Fire is his promised destination. So be not you in doubt about it. Verily, it is truth from your Lord, though most men believe not.
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie concerning Allah? Such shall be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses shall say, "These it is who lied about their Lord." Now the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers
Who turn men away from the path of Allah, and crave to make it crooked, and disbelieve in the Hereafter.
Such will not escape in the earth, nor have they patrons other than Allah. Doubled for them is the torment. They could not bear to hear, nor did they see.
These it is who have lost their souls, and that which they used to devise has failed them.
No doubt in the Hereafter these are the greatest losers.
Verily, those who believe and do what is right, and humble themselves before their Lord, they are the Fellows of the Garden; they shall dwell therein. 
The similitude of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf (on the one hand), and the seeing and the hearing (on the other); are they equal in similitude? Will you not then take heed?
We did send Noah unto his people, saying, "Verily, I am to you a plain Warner;
That you should not worship any save Allah. Verily, I fear for you the torment of the grievous Day."
But the chiefs of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, "We only see in you a mortal like ourselves; nor do we see that any follow you except the most abject (or meanest, most ignorant or most deficient) amongst us by a rash (or immature) judgment; nor do we see that you have any merit above us; nay more, we think you are liars!"
Noah said, "O my people! Bethink you, if I rely upon a manifest Sign from my Lord, and there come to me mercy from Him, and you are blind to it (or it has been made obscure to you); can we compel you to accept it while you are averse to it?
"O my people! I do not ask you for wealth in return for it; my hire (or wage, reward) is only from Allah. Nor will I repulse (drive away) those who believe. Verily, they shall meet their Lord. But I see you as a people who are ignorant. 
"O my people! Who will help me against Allah, were I to repel them? Do you not then reflect? 
"I say not unto you that I have the treasures of Allah; nor do I know the unseen; nor do I say: verily, I am an angel; nor do I say of those whom your eyes despise: Allah will never give them any good - Allah knows best what is in their souls, verily, I should then be of the wrong-doers (unjust)."
They said, "O Noah! You have wrangled with us, and have multiplied disputation among us. Now bring upon us what you have threatened us with, if you are of the truthful." 
Said he, "Allah will only bring it on you when He pleases, nor can you make Him helpless (frustrate Him);
Nor will my advice profit you were I minded to advise you, if Allah wills to keep you astray. He is your Lord, and unto Him shall you return."
Do they say, "He has invented it?" Say, "If I have devised it, then on me be my crime, but I am clear (innocent) of all that you commit."
And Noah was inspired (in these words), "None shall surely believe amongst your people but those who have believed already; take it not then ill that which they do.
And make the Ark under Our eyes (supervision, purposes), and at Our inspiration (instructions); and plead not with Me for those who have done wrong. Verily, they shall be drowned."
So he made the Ark; and every time the chiefs of his people passed by him they mocked at him. Said he, "If you mock at us, verily, we shall mock at you even as you are mocking,
And you shall surely soon know who it is to whom the punishment that confounds and shames shall come, and upon whom shall fall the lasting doom."
Then when Our commandment came to pass, and the geysers gushed forth water, We said, "Load therein two of every kind, a pair (male and female), and your family, save him on whom the sentence has already been passed, and those who believe." But there were but few who believed with him. 
And he said, "Ride you therein. In the name of Allah is its course, and its mooring. Verily, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful." 
And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains; and Noah cried to his son who had gone aside (stood aloof or separated himself), "O my boy! Ride with us and be not with the disbelievers." 
The son replied, "I will betake me to some mountain that shall save me from the water (I will find another solution)." Said Noah, "There is none this day that can save from the command of Allah, except for him on whom He may have mercy." And the wave came between them, and he was amongst the drowned.
And it was said, "O earth! Swallow down your water! And, O heaven! Withhold you rain!" And the water abated; and the matter was decided, and the Ark settled on Mount Judi, and the word went forth, "Removed are the evildoing people!"
And Noah called unto his Lord saying, "My Lord, verily, my son is of my family (people), and, surely Thy promise is true, and Thou art the most just of judges."
He said, "O Noah! He is not of your family (people); verily, because his conduct is unrighteous. Therefore ask Me not for that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, I give you counsel lest you should be among the ignorant."
He said, "My Lord, verily, I seek refuge in Thee (from wrong) lest I ask Thee that whereof I have no knowledge. Unless Thou dost forgive me and have mercy on me, I shall be of those who are lost."
The word came, "O Noah! Descend (from the Ark) in peace from Us, and blessings upon you and upon some of the communities who will descend from you; but other communities We shall grant enjoyment for a time and then there shall touch, them, from Us grievous woe." 
These are some of the stories of the Unseen that We reveal unto you. You did not know them before this, you and your people. So persevere patiently; verily, the sequel is for those who fear (are righteous).
And unto the tribe of A'ad (We sent) their brother Hud. He said, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God but Him. You do but invent lies (superstitions, fantasies, self-deception).
"O my people! I do not ask you for hire (wages, rewards) in return (for the message); Lo, my hire is only from Him who created me: have you then no sense (or understanding)?
"O my people! Ask pardon of your Lord; then turn to Him in repentance; He will send the skies (rain, spiritual, social and material bounties) down on you in torrents; and He will add strength to your strength: turn not away, guilty."
They said, "O Hud! You have not come to us with a manifest sign (or clear proof); nor will we leave our gods at your word; nor will we believe in you.
We say nothing but that, perhaps, some of our gods have possessed you with madness." Said he, "Verily, I call Allah to witness, and do you bear witness too, that I am free from ascribing to (or associating with) Him,
"Other gods as partners. Plot then against me together (as much as you like), and give me no respite.
Verily, I trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no beast that walks but He grasps it by its forelock (has complete power over it). Verily, my Lord is on the Straight Way!
"But if you turn your backs, then I have conveyed to you that wherewith I was sent to you; and my Lord will replace you with another people. You cannot harm (frustrate) Him at all; verily, my Lord is Guardian over all things!"
And when Our commandment came We saved Hud, and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us; We saved them from a harsh torment. 
Such were (the tribe of) A'ad. They denied the signs of their Lord, and rebelled against His Messengers, and followed the bidding of every headstrong tyrant.
They were followed in this world by a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection. Behold! A'ad disbelieved in their Lord! Aye! Removed were A'ad the people of Hud!
And unto Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. Said he, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God but Him. He it is that produced you from the earth, and made you live therein! So ask pardon of Him; then turn to Him in repentance. Verily, my Lord is Nigh, Responsive!"
They said, "O Salih! You were, before this, amongst us one we hoped in. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? Verily, we are in grave doubt as to that to which you call us."
He said, "O my people! Bethink you, if I stand upon a manifest sign (clear proof) from my Lord, and there come from Him mercy, who will help me against Allah if I rebel against Him? You will add to me naught but perdition.
"O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a test (symbol, token) for you; leave her, then, to feed in Allah's earth, and touch her not with harm, lest a near torment seize you." 
But they did hamstring her, and he said, "Enjoy yourselves in your houses for three days; this is the promise that shall not be belied."
And when Our commandment came to pass, We saved Salih, and those who believed with him, by Our mercy, from the ignominy of that day. Verily, your Lord He is Powerful and Mighty.
And a mighty noise caught those who had done wrong; and on the morrow they were lying corpses in their houses,
As though they had never dwelt therein. Behold, Thamud indeed disbelieved in their Lord. Aye! Removed were the Thamud!
Our messengers came unto Abraham with Glad Tidings. They said, "Peace!" He answered, "Peace be it!" and did not delay to bring the roasted calf. 
But when he saw that their hands reached not to it, he felt mistrust, and conceived a fear of them. They said, "Fear not. Verily, we are sent unto the people of Lot." 
And his wife was standing by, laughing; and We gave her the glad tidings of Isaac, and of Jacob after Isaac. 
Said she, "Alas for me! Shall I bear a son when I am an old woman, and this husband of mine an old man? Verily, this is a strange thing!" 
They said, "Do you wonder at the commandment of Allah? The Mercy of Allah and His blessings upon you, O you people of the house! Verily, He is worthy of all Praise, worthy of all Glory."
And when his terror left Abraham, and the glad tidings reached him, he pleaded with Us on behalf of the people of Lot.
Verily, Abraham was relenting (tolerant), compassionate, and Allah-relying,
(It was said,) "O Abraham! Forsake this (pleading). Verily, the commandment of your Lord has gone forth, and verily, there comes to them a torment that cannot be repelled."
And when Our messengers (angels) came to Lot, he was grieved for them (the people), and his arm was powerless to aid them. He said, "This is a distressful day!" 
And his people came unto him, rushing, for they were long used to committing abomination (homosexuality). He said, "O my people! Here are my daughters (or young women), they are purer for you. Fear Allah, and do not disgrace me through my guests. Is there not among you one right-minded man?"
They said, "You know that we have no need of your daughters; verily, you well know what we want!" 
He said, "Would that I had strength to resist you or could betake myself of some powerful support!" 
(The messengers) said, "O Lot! Verily, we are the messengers of your Lord. They shall certainly not reach you; now travel with your people in the darkness of the night, and let none of you look round. But your wife (will do so), and there shall befall her what befalls them. Verily, their appointment is for the morning! And is not the morning nigh?"
And when Our commandment came, We overthrew (their town), making their high parts into low parts (turned them upside down). And We rained down upon them stones and baked clay one after another, 
Marked with fire from your Lord, and these are never far from the wrongdoers!
And unto Midian (we sent) their brother Shu'eyb. He said, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God but Him, and give not short measure and weight. Verily, I see you well off; but, verily, I fear for you the torments of an encompassing Day. 
"O my people! Give measure and weight fairly, and defraud not men of their due; and wreak not wrong in the earth, corrupting it. 
"That which Allah leaves for you is better for you if you be believers. But I am not a guardian (or keeper) over you."
They said, "O Shu'eyb! Do your prayers bid you that we should forsake what our fathers served, or that we should not do as we please with our own property? You are, forsooth, the clement and straight-forward one (or simpleton)!"
He said, "O my people! Bethink you, if I stand upon a manifest sign (clear proof) from my Lord, and He provides me from Himself with a goodly provision, how can I concede aught to you. I desire not to do behind your backs that which I forbid you. I desire naught but to reform you so far as I am able. Nor comes my grace through any one but Allah. On Him do I rely, and unto Him I turn. 
"O my people! Let not a breach with me cause you to so sin that there befall you the like of that which befell the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the people of Salih, nor are the people of Lot far off from you! 
"So ask pardon from your Lord, then turn to Him repentant; verily, my Lord is Merciful, Loving!"
They said, "O Shu'eyb! We do not understand much of what you say, and we see that you are weak (powerless) amongst us; and were it not for your family we would stone you, nor could you have power over us."
He said, "O my people! Are my family more esteemed by you than Allah? Or have you taken Him as something to cast behind your backs? Verily, my Lord, surrounds all you do.
"O my people! Act according to your power; verily, I too will act, and you soon will know on whom comes a doom that will abase them, and him who is a liar. Watch then; verily, I am watching with you."
And when Our commandment came, We saved Shu'eyb, and those who believed with him, by Our Mercy; and the great noise seized those who had done wrong, and on the morrow they were found prostrate in their houses
As though they had not dwelt therein. Behold! Removed was Midian! As was removed Thamud!"
And We sent Moses with our signs (revelations) and with obvious (clear) power
Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs; but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was no right (or true, straight) guidance.
He shall approach his people on the Day of Resurrection, and take them to the Fire (as cattle are led to the watering-place) - ah, a woeful watering-place is that wither they are led!
A curse follows them in this world and on the Day of Resurrection - ah, woeful is the gift that will be given them!
That is one of the stories of the communities that We recite to you  - Some of them are standing now and some already mown down!
We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. Their gods on whom they called instead of Allah availed them naught when once the command of your Lord had come; they add to them naught save ruin!
Even thus is your Lord's grasp when He overtakes the communities that have done wrong; verily, His grasp is grievous, strong.
Verily, in this is a sign to him who fears the torment of the Hereafter - that is a Day unto which mankind shall be gathered, and that is a Day of Witness (a Day pointed to by events, a Day when testimony is given about the deeds of men, a Day which will be seen by all, a Day when the consequences of action come home.)
We will delay it not, save unto an appointed time, already numbered. 
The Day when it comes, no soul shall speak save by His permission, and some shall be wretched and some glad.
And as for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire; sighing and wailing will be their lot,
Abiding therein for so long as the heavens and the earth endure; save for what your Lord wills. Verily, your Lord is Accomplisher of what He wills (or plans).
And as for those who are glad, they will be in the Garden, abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure; save what your Lord wills, a gift unfailing!
Be not then in doubt concerning what these men serve (or worship); they only serve as their fathers served before; and We will give them their portion undiminished.
When We gave Moses the Book before, they disagreed (or disputed) concerning it. Had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the matter would have been decided between them; but, verily, they are still in hesitating doubt concerning it.
But, verily, every one will your Lord surely recompense for their works; verily, He is well Informed of what they do!
So stand you firm in the Straight Path, as you are commanded - you and those who turn unto Allah with you, and transgress you not. Verily, He is Seer of what you do.
Lean not unto those who do wrong, lest the Fire touches you, for you have no patrons but Allah; nor shall you be helped!
And be you steadfast in prayer at the two ends of the day, and the (three) watches of the night. Verily, good things annul evil things. This is a reminder for the mindful.
And be you patient, for Allah wastes not the wages of those who do good.
If only there had been, among the generations before you, men endowed with a remnant of virtue (balance, sobriety, righteousness, good sense) forbidding (warning, preventing) men from corruption in the earth, as did the few whom We saved from them. But the evildoers followed that by which they made (or were made) sapless (they enjoyed, drained and became drained), and were guilty.
In truth your Lord did not destroy the communities unjustly while they were doing right. (Or for a few or minor wrong-doings, or while there were few wrong-doers, or while they had the potentiality to mend).
Had your Lord pleased, He could have made men one nation; but they will not cease to dispute
Save those on whom your Lord has had mercy. For this did He create them. And the Word of your Lord is fulfiled, "Verily, I will surely fill hell with Jinns and Mankind altogether."
And all that We relate to you of the stories of the Messengers in order that thereby We might make firm your heart. And herein has the truth come to you, an admonition and a reminder to the believers.
Say to those who believe not, "Act according to your power, verily, we are acting too! 
And wait ye, verily, we are waiting too!"
Allah's are the unseen things of the heavens and of the earth; and unto Him do all affairs return. So serve (worship) Him and put your trust in Him; for your Lord is not heedless of what you do.
ALIF LAM RA. These are the verses (or symbols) of the Perspicuous (or clarifying) Book. 
Verily, We have revealed it as a Lecture (a Quran) in Arabic; per chance (or possibly) you may understand.
We tell you the best (the most beautiful, appealing, enlightening) of narratives in that We inspired in you this Quran, though you were before it among the heedless.
When Joseph said to his father, "O my father! Verily, I saw (in my dream) eleven stars, and the sun, and the moon - I saw them prostrating themselves unto me!"
He said, "O my boy! Tell not your vision to your brethren, for they will plot against you. Verily, Satan is to man an open foe."
Thus your Lord will prefer you, and teach you the interpretation of events, and fulfil His favour upon you, and upon the family of Jacob, as He fulfiled it upon your two forefathers, Abraham and Isaac, before you. Verily, your Lord is Knowing, Wise!
In Joseph and his brethren were signs to those who inquire (or seek Truth).
When they said, "Surely, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, though we are many. Verily, our father is in obvious aberration (wandering in mind).
"Slay Joseph, or cast him out to some (far or unknown) land; that your father's face (favour) may be free for you, and you may afterwards be a righteous folk."
One from amongst them said, "Slay not Joseph, but, if you must act, throw him into the bottom of a pit; some caravan of travellers may pick him up."
Said they, "O our father! What ails you that you will not trust us with Joseph seeing we are unto him sincere (well wishers)? 
Send him with us to-morrow to revel and to play, and, verily, we will take good care of him."
Said he, "Verily, it grieves me that you should take him with you, for I fear lest the wolf devour him while you take no heed."
Said they, "Why, if the wolf should devour him while we are so (strong) a band, verily, then we should ourselves have perished first."
And when they had gone off with him and agreed to put him in the depths of a pit, We inspired him, "Thou shall surely remind them of this affair of theirs when they know you not."
And they came to their father in the evening weeping.
And they said, "O our father! Verily, we went forth to race and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf devoured him, but you will not believe us though we speak the truth."
And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. Said he, "Nay, but your souls have beguiled you into some deed; but patience is more fitting for me. And Allah alone is He whose aid is to be sought against that which you describe."
And a caravan of travellers came and sent their water-drawer. He let down his bucket into the pit. Said he, "What good luck! Here is a youth." So they concealed him, as a treasure, and Allah was Aware of what they did.
And they sold him for a mean price, a few dirham counted out- in such low estimation did they hold him.
And the man from Egypt who had bought him said to his wife, "Make his stay with us honourable; it may be he will be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of ahadith (events, traditions, sayings, dreams etc.). Allah has full power and control over His (or Joseph's) affairs; but most of mankind know not.
And when he had reached maturity We gave him judgment (or wisdom or power) and knowledge, for thus do We reward those who do good and right. 
And she, in whose house he was, desired to seduce him for his person (or body, or away from his true self); and she locked the doors and said, "Come you (to me)!" Said he, "I seek refuge in Allah (Allah forbid)! Verily, he (your husband) is my lord who has made my stay here agreeable (treated me well). Verily, wrong-doers (ultimately) never prosper."
And she desired (lusted after) him, and he would have desired her, had it not been that he saw the argument (or evidence) of his Lord; thus did We ordain that We might turn away evil and lewdness from him; for verily, he was one of our servants, sincere and purified.
And they raced to the door and she rent his shirt from behind; and they met her lord (husband) at the door. Said she, "What else is the recompense for him who wishes evil for your family, but prison or a grievous doom?"
Said he (Joseph), "She it was who sought to seduce me for my person (or from my true self)." And one from among her family saw this and bore witness thus "If his shirt be rent from in front, then she speaks the truth and he is of the liars;
"But if his shirt be rent from behind, then she lies and he is of the truthful."
And when he saw his shirt rent from behind he (her husband) said, "This is one of the guiles (or tricks) of you women; verily, your tricks are great! 
"O Joseph! Turn aside from this (pass it over). And do you, woman, ask pardon for your fault; for truly, you are of the sinful."
And some women in the city said, "The wife of the King's Minister seeks to seduce her slave for his person; truly, he has infatuated (smitten) her with lust: verily, we see her in manifest error."
And when she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them, and prepared for them a banquet, and gave each of them a knife; and she said (to Joseph), "Come forth to them!" And when they saw him they exalted (admired) him and cut their hands exclaiming, "Allah preserve us! No mortal is this! This is none but a noble angel."
Said she, "There before you is he about whom you blamed me. I did seek to seduce him for his person, but he did save himself firmly, guiltless. But now if he does not what I bid him he shall surely be cast into prison and shall surely be among those brought low."
Said he, "O My Lord! Prison is dearer to me than what they call on me to do; and unless you turn from me their wiles I shall incline unto them and shall be among the foolish."
And his Lord answered him and turned from him their wiles; verily, He is Hearer, Knower.
Then it appeared good to them, even after they had seen the signs (of his innocence), to imprison him for a time.
And two young men went to prison with him. Said one of them, "Verily, I dreamt that I was pressing wine." And the other said, "Verily, I dreamt that I was bearing on my head loaves from which the birds did eat." "Tell us" (they said) "the interpretation thereof; for verily, we see that you are of those who are wise and do good."
He said, "I shall tell you both of its interpretation before your daily meal is brought to you. That is (some) of what my Lord has taught me; verily, I have forsaken the faith of a people who believe not in Allah, and disbelieve in the Hereafter. 
And I have followed the faith of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us to associate aught as partners with Allah. This is of the Bounty (or Grace) from Allah upon us and upon mankind: but most men give not thanks. 
O you two fellow-prisoners! Are manifold lords better, or Allah, the One, the Almighty? 
What you worship beside Him are naught but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Judgment rests with Allah only, who commands you to worship none but Him. That is the right religion, but most men know not.
O you two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he shall pour out wine for his lord to drink: and as for the other, he shall be crucified, and the birds shall eat from his head. Thus is the matter decreed whereof you did inquire."
And he said to him of the two whom he knew would escape, "Remember me with your Lord!" But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord, so he (Joseph) lingered in prison for a few more years.
And the king said, "Verily, I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean kine devoured; and seven green ears of corn and (seven) others dry. O you chiefs! Explain to me my vision, if dreams you can interpret!"
Said they, "Confused dreams! And naught know we of the interpretation of such dreams."
Then he of the twain who had escaped, remembered after a while, and said, "Verily, I will inform you of the interpretation thereof, so send me forth."
(When he came to Joseph, he said) "Joseph! O you truthful one! Explain to us the seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and the seven green ears of corn and others dry that I may return to the people, per chance (or possibly) they then may know!"
He said, "You shall sow for seven years, as is your wont; but what you reap, leave it in the ear, except a little whereof you eat. 
Then there shall come after that seven severe years which shall devour what you have put by before for them, save a little which you shall preserve. 
Then there will come after that a year in which the people shall have abundant rain and in which they shall press (wine and oil).
Then the king (after he had been told) said, "Bring him (Joseph) unto me." And when the messenger came unto him, Joseph said, "Return to your Lord, and ask him, what is the state of mind of the women who cut their hands? Verily, my lord knows their guile."
He (the king sent for the women and) said, "What happened when you sought to seduce Joseph?" They said, "Allah preserve us! We know no evil of him." Said the wife of the Minister, "Now is the truth exposed! It was I who sought to seduce him. Truly, he is of the truthful."
(The wife said) "This, I asked that he (my lord) might know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah guides not the guile of the betrayers.
"Yet I do not absolve myself, for the human soul is prone to evil, save that on which my Lord has mercy; verily, my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful."
And the king said, "Bring him (Joseph) to me. I will give him a special position with myself." And when he had spoken with him he said, "Verily, to-day you are with us in a well established place of trust."
He said, "Place me over the store-house of the land; verily, I will be an expert custodian. (one who is skilled and knows what is required.)"
Thus did We establish Joseph in the land that he might possess (settle or control) what part (in the manner, time and place) he pleases. We reach with Our mercy whom We will. We waste not the wages of those who do right.
Surely the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and fears (ward off evil or are constant in righteousness).
And his brethren came to Joseph, and they presented themselves unto him and he knew them, but they recognised him not.
And when he had given them their provisions he said, "Bring me your brother that you have from your father (but different mothers). Do you not see that I give good measure, and that I am the best of hosts?
"But if you bring him not to me, no measure shall you have with me, nor shall you come nigh me."
They said, "We will beg him from our father, and we will surely do it."
Then he said to his servants, "Put their merchandise (they brought in payment) back into their packs, so that they may discover it only when they have returned to their family; per chance (or possibly) they may return."
And when they returned to their father, they said, "O our father! A measure is withheld from us; so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure, and, verily, we will guard him well."
He said, "Shall I entrust you with him with results other than when I entrusted you with his brother before him? But Allah is the best of keepers, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful."
And when they opened their packs they found their merchandise restored to them. Said they, "O our father! What more can we crave? Here are our goods restored to us. We shall get provisions for our folk, and we shall guard our brother, and shall have an additional camel load of provisions. This is but a small measure (compared to what we can obtain or to the Egyptian Store-house)."
He said, "I will by no means send him with you until you give me a solemn oath - In the name of Allah that you will surely bring him back to me, unless you are yourselves besieged (made powerless)." So when they had sworn their oaths he said, "Allah is in charge (witness, judge and guardian) over what we say."
And he said further, "O my sons! Enter not by one gate, but enter by several gates. Not that I can avail you aught against Allah. Lo! Judgment (decision, command) rests only with Allah. In Him do I put my trust, and on Him do the trusting rely."
And when they had entered as their father bade them, it availed them nothing against (the plan of) Allah. It fulfiled but a want in Jacob's soul; for, verily, he was possessed of knowledge that We had taught him; but most of mankind know not.
And when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he took his brother to stay with him, and said, "Verily, I, even I, am your brother, so sorrow not for their doings (past, present and future)."
And when he had given them their provisions, he placed the drinking cup in his brother's pack; then a crier shouted out, "O you in the caravan! Verily, you are thieves!"
They said, turning to them, "What is it that you miss?"
Said they, "We miss the goblet of the king, and whoever brings it shall have a camel-load, and I will be bound by it (the promise)."
They said, "By Allah! You knew we came not to do evil in the land, and that we were not thieves."
They said, "And what shall be the penalty thereof if you prove to be liars?"
They said, "The recompense thereof is he in whose pack it is found - he shall be the recompense (atonement) thereof (as a bondsman); thus do we recompense the unjust."
And he began (searching) their sacks before the sacks of his brother; then he drew it forth from his brother's sack. Thus did We devise a stratagem for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the king's law unless Allah willed. We raise by degrees of mercy whom We will, and over every possessor of knowledge is one who knows more (or One All-knowing).
They said, "If he has stolen, a brother of his has stolen before him." But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and disclosed it not to them, but said within himself, "You are in a worse situation (than you think), and Allah knows best the truth about what you allege."
They said, "O exalted one (ruler, minister)! Verily, he has a father, aged and venerable (who will grieve). Take then one of us instead of him; verily, we can see that you are of those who do good."
Said he, "I seek refuge in Allah from taking any save him with whom we found our property; verily, we should then be certainly unjust."
And when they despaired of (moving) him they retired to consult privately. Said the eldest of them, "Remember you not how your father took an oath from you. In the name of Allah? And how before this you failed in your duty with Joseph? I will surely not quit the land until my father give me leave, or Allah judge for me, for He is the Best of Judges.
"Return you to your father and say, 'O our father! Verily, your son has committed theft, and we bore testimony to naught but what we knew. We could not guard against the unseen (the unforeseen, the unknown or the hidden)"
"Ask then in the city where we were, and of the caravan in which we travelled there, for, verily, we tell the truth."
He (their father when had heard this) said, "Nay, your souls have beguiled (tempted, diverted, deceived) you to something (that serves you). But patience is fitter for me. It may be that Allah will bring them all to me. Verily, He is Knower, Wise."
And he turned away from them and said, "Alas great is my grief for Joseph!" and his eyes grew white with the sorrow he repressed.
They said, "By Allah! You will not cease to remember Joseph till your health is ruined or you are of those who perish!"
Said he, "I complain of (or expose) my distress and anguish only to Allah, for I know from Allah that which you know not.
"O my sons! Go and inquire concerning Joseph and his brother, and despair not of Allah's comfort (soothing mercy); for, verily, none despairs of the Mercy of Allah save a faithless people."
And when they returned into his (Joseph's) presence they said, "O exalted one! Misfortune has touched both us, and our families, and we have brought scanty capital. So give us full measure and treat it as charity; verily, Allah rewards the charitable."
He said, "Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?"
They said, "Are you then indeed Joseph?" He said, "I am Joseph, and this is my brother; Allah has been gracious towards us. Verily, whoever fears Allah (repulses evil or is righteous) and is patient (endures) - verily, Allah wastes not the hire of those who do right (or good)."
They said, "By Allah! Allah has chosen (or preferred) you over us; and we indeed were guilty."
He said, "No reproach against you this day! Allah will pardon you, for He is the most Merciful of the merciful. 
Take this my shirt, and lay it over the face of my father, he will become able to see; and come to me with all your family."
And when the caravan left (Egypt), their father said, "Verily, I smell the presence of Joseph; nay, think me not a dotard."  
Those around him said, "By Allah! You are in your old meandering mind." 
And when the herald of glad tidings (Judah) came he threw it on his face, and he was restored to clear sight (became a seer). Said he, "Did I not tell you that I know from Allah that of which you know not?
They said, "O our father! Ask pardon for us of our sins; verily, we were sinners!"
He said, "I will ask pardon for you from my Lord; verily, He is the Forgiving, Merciful."
And when they came before Joseph, he took his parents to stay with him, and said, "Enter you into Egypt, in safety if it please Allah." 
And he raised his parents upon the throne (of dignity), and they fell down before him prostrate. And he said, "O my sire! This is the fulfilment of my vision of old; my Lord has made it come true, and He has shown me kindness in bringing me forth out of prison, and bringing you from the desert, after Satan had made a breach between me and my brethren. Verily, my Lord is kind to whomsoever He will; verily, He is the Knower, the Wise.
"O my Lord! Thou hast given me some dominion (power, sovereignty), and have taught me something of the interpretation of dreams and events (and sayings, stories etc.); O Thou Originator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my patron (protector, provider and guide) in this world and the next; make me to die (or take my soul) as one who has Surrendered unto Thee  (as a Muslim), and unite me with the righteous!"
That is one of the stories of the unseen that We inspire in you (Muhammad). You were not with them when they agreed in their affair when they were scheming.
And though you ardently desires it, most of mankind will not believe (or have faith).
You do not ask them a fee for it; it is naught else but a reminder unto the creatures.
How many a sign is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by with face averted!
And most of them believe not in Allah without associating partners with Him.
Think they themselves secure, then, from overwhelming punishment coming on them from Allah, or from the Hour coming upon them suddenly while they are unaware?
Say, "This is my Way; I call now unto Allah with sure knowledge (or clear proof), I and those who follow me - Glory be to Allah - for I am not of the idolaters."
We never sent before you any, save men whom We inspired, from among the people of the townships (or communities). Have they not journeyed in the earth and beheld the consequences for those who were before them? Verily, the abode of Hereafter is surely better for those who believe; have they then no sense?
Until when the Messenger despaired and they thought that they were proved liars, then came Our help unto them, and whoever We pleased was saved; but Our wrath is not averted from the guilty.
In their histories, surely, there are lessons for people endowed with understanding. It is not an invented tale, but a confirmation of the scriptures before it, and a detailed explanation of everything, and a guide and a mercy to a people who believe.
ALIF LAM MIM RA. These are the signs (or verses) of the Book; that which is sent down to you from your Lord is the truth; but most people believe not.
Allah it is who has raised the heavens without supporting columns that you can see; then He established Himself firmly on the throne (of authority and control), and subjected the sun and the moon (to His Law or service). Each one runs on its course for an appointed time. He regulates affairs, (or details the signs or revelations), that per chance (or possibly) you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.
And He it is who has stretched out the earth and placed therein firm mountains and flowing rivers, and of every fruit has He placed therein in pairs. He makes the night cover the day. Lo! Herein are signs unto a people who reflect.
And on the earth are diverse but neighbouring tracts, gardens of vines and ploughed fields of corn, and palms growing together (from one root) alike or not; they are watered with the same water, yet We distinguish one over the other as food; verily, in these are signs unto a people who have sense (or understanding.)
And if you should wonder (at their lack of faith), wondrous are their words, "When we have become dust (or are actually dust), shall we then be created anew?" These are they who disbelieve in their Lord, and these are they with fetters (yokes of servitude to superstition) round their necks, and these are the fellows of the Fire; they shall dwell therein.
They ask you to hasten on the evil rather than the good; yet examples come to pass before them: but your Lord is rich in forgiveness unto mankind despite their wrongdoing; but, verily, your Lord is also strict in punishment.
Those who disbelieve say, "Why is no special Sign sent down upon him from his Lord." But you are only a Warner, and for every people a guide.
Allah knows what each female (womb) bears, by how much the wombs fall short of or exceed (in time or number); for everything with Him is measured (calculated or in proportion).
He is the Knower of the Invisible (or unseen or hidden) and the Visible (or obvious or apparent); He is the Great, the Most High (or the Most Exalted).
Alike among you is he who keeps secret his speech and he who broadcasts it; and he who hides by night and he who stalks abroad by day. 
Each of them has a succession (of angels) before him and behind him, to keep guard over him at the command of Allah; verily, Allah changes not the condition of a people until they change that which is in their heart (or in their souls or change it for themselves). And when Allah wishes misfortune for a people there is no averting it, nor have they a protector beside Him.
He it is who shows you the lightning, a fear and hope; and He brings up the clouds heavy (with quickening, life-giving, fertilizing) rain.
And the thunder hymns His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him; and He sends the thunderclap and smites therewith whom He will while they dispute about Allah; but He is strong and All-mighty.
True prayer is only a call to Allah; and those who call on others besides Him shall not be answered at all, except as one who stretches out his hand to the water that it may reach his mouth, but it reaches it not! The call of the disbelievers is futile.
And unto Allah do prostrate whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening.
Say, "Who is Lord (and Sustainer) of the heavens and the earth?" Say, "Allah" Say, "Do ye, then, take beside Allah patrons who have no control over benefit or harm to themselves?" Say, "Shall the blind and the seeing be held equal? Or shall the darkness and the light be held equal? Or have they made partners with Allah who can create as He creates, so that the creations seem similar to them?" Say, "Allah is the creator of all things, and He is the One, the Almighty."
He sends down from the sky water, and the channels flow according to their measure, and the torrent bears away the foam that mounts to the surface. Even so from that which they heat in the fire (metal ore etc.), craving to make ornaments or utensils, comes a scum like that. Thus does Allah show (by similitudes and parables) the truth and the falsehood (or vanity) - as for the scum it is thrown off, and as for what profits man it stays on the earth. Thus does Allah coin Similitudes (or parables)!
For those who respond to their Lord are all good things; but those who respond not to Him, had they all that is in the earth, and as much more, in vain would they offer it for ransom; for these there is a terrible reckoning, and their resort is hell - what a bed of misery it will be!
Is he who knows that what is revealed unto you from your Lord is the Truth like him who is blind? But only men of understanding heed.
Those who fulfil the Covenant of Allah and break not the pact, 
And those who join (attain) what Allah has commanded to be joined (attained), and dread their Lord and fear the woeful reckoning; 
And those who patiently persevere, craving their Lord's Countenance, and are steadfast in prayer, and spend, secretly and openly, in charity from what We have bestowed upon them, and overcome evil with good - these shall have the sequel of the final (heavenly) Home -
Gardens of perpetual bliss, into which they shall enter with the righteous amongst their fathers and their wives and their seed; and the angels shall enter unto them from every gate: -
(With the salutation) "Peace be upon you! For that you persevered in patience; and excellent is the sequel of final home."
And those who break the Covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and who sever what Allah hath commanded to be joined, and who do mischief in the earth - upon these is the curse of Allah, and for them is an ill abode.
Allah expands his bounty freely to whomsoever He will, or He restricts its measure; and they rejoice in the life of this world, but the life of this world is naught but a temporary comfort compared with the Hereafter.
Those who disbelieve say, "Unless a sign is sent down upon him from his Lord....". Say, "Truly, Allah leads whom He will astray, but guides unto Him those who turn in repentance.
"Those who believe and whose heart have rest in Zikr (remembering or mention) of Allah. Verily, in Zikr (remembering or mention) of Allah do hearts find rest (comfort, satisfaction, fulfilment).
Those who believe and do what is right; Joy is for them and an excellent journey's end."
Thus have We sent you to a nation before which other nations have passed away, to recite unto them that which We have inspired in you, while they are disbelievers in the Beneficent. Say, "He is my Lord; there is no God but He; On Him do I rely, and unto Him do I turn."
And if there were a Quran by which the mountains were moved, or by which the earth was torn asunder, or the dead made to speak (this would be the one, but what would be the point) - Nay, Allah's is the whole command! Did not those who believe know that if Allah had pleased He would have guided all mankind? As for those who disbelieve calamity (disaster) does not cease to overtake them for what they do, or it dwells close by their homes until Allah's promise comes to pass. Verily, Allah fails not in His promise.
Is He who stands over every soul, aware of what it has earned (like others)? And yet they join partners with Allah! Say, "Name (describe) them; can you inform Him of what He does not know in the earth? Or is it for their name's sake only (that you call upon them) (Is it merely a way of speaking)? Nay, but their stratagem is made seemly to those who disbelieve, and they turn folks from the path of Allah! But whomsoever Allah does lead astray, no guide has he."
For them is torment in the life of this world; but surely the torment of the Hereafter is more wretched still, nor have they against Allah a defender.
A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who fear Allah, beneath it rivers flow, its food is enduring, and likewise its shade (shelter, security)! That is the reward of those who fear (keep their duty); but the reward of disbelievers is the Fire!
And those to whom We brought the Book rejoice in that which We have sent down to you; but among the clans (sects, parties, sections) are some who deny a part thereof. Say, "I am only bidden to serve Allah and not to associate partners with Him; Unto Him do I call and unto Him is my return."
Thus have We revealed it, a decisive judgment in Arabic, but had you followed their lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions), after the knowledge that has come to you, then truly, would you have against Allah no protecting friend nor defender.
And verily, We sent Messengers before you, and We appointed for them wives and offsprings; and it was not given to any Messenger that he should bring a sign save by Allah's permission. For every period there is a Book revealed (or Law decreed or Decree established).
Allah blots out what He will, or He establishes (what He wills); and with Him is the Mother of the Book (or Source of Ordinances).
Whether We will let you see a part of what We have promised them, or take you to Ourself (before this), your duty is only to deliver the message, Ours is the reckoning.
See they not how We visit the land and reduce its borders (through conquest)? Allah judges (or commands), and there is none to reverse His judgment (or command), and He is swift at reckoning!
And those who were before them plotted; but all plotting is Allah's! He knows what every soul earns; and the disbelievers shall come to know who comes Home in the end.
And those who disbelieve say, "You ar no Messenger!" Say, "Allah is witness enough between me and you; and so is he who has the knowledge of the Book (any revealed Scripture)!"
ALIF LAM MIM. A book which We have revealed unto you , to bring men forth from darkness into light, - by permission of their Lord - unto the Way of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy.
Allah is He unto Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Alas for the disbelievers, for a terrible doom; 
Those who love the life of this world better than the Hereafter, and turn folks from the path of Allah, and crave to make it crooked; these are far astray.
We never sent a Messenger save with the language of his people, that he might clarify the message to them. Then Allah leads whom He will astray, and guides whom He will; and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
We did send Moses with our signs, saying, "Bring forth your people from the darkness into the light, and remind them of the Days of Allah!" Verily, in that are signs to every patient, grateful one.
Remember when Moses said to his people, "Remember the favours of Allah towards you, when He saved you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live;" in that was a great trial for you from your Lord.
When your Lord proclaimed, "If you give thanks I will surely give you increase; but if you are thankless, verily, my torment is severe!" 
And Moses said, "If you are thankless, you and all on the earth, then - verily, Allah is self-sufficient and Praiseworthy."
Has not the history come to you of those who were before you, of the people of Noah, and A'ad, and Thamud, and those who came after them? None knows them save Allah. Their Messengers came unto them with manifest signs; but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said, "Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you are sent, and we are in grave doubt concerning that to which you call us!" 
Their Messengers said, "Is there doubt about Allah, the originator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you to pardon you for your sins, and to reprieve you unto an appointed term." They said, "You are but mortals like ourselves; you wish to turn us from what our fathers used to serve. Bring us, then, clear authority!"
Their Messengers said unto them, "We are only mortals like yourselves; but Allah gives grace unto whomsoever He will of His servants, and it is not for us to bring you an authority, save by His permission. In Allah let believers rely!" 
What ails us that we should not put our trust in Allah when He has guided us in our paths? We will surely endure the hurt you do us. In Allah let the trusting put their trust.
And those who disbelieved said to their Messengers, "We will drive you forth from our land; or else you shall return to our faith!" Then their Lord inspired them, saying "We will surely destroy the unjust; 
And We will make you to dwell in the land after them. That is for him who fears (keeps in mind) My Time (of Judgment or Majesty) and fears (keeps in mind) My punishment (or threat)."
Then they sought to force a decision (to settle the matter in their favour); and disappointed was every rebel tyrant! 
Behind such a one is hell, and he is given to drink boiling fetid liquid (unwholesome products of disease like pus).
Which he sips but cannot swallow; and death comes upon him from every side, and yet he can not die; and before him is unrelenting woe!
This is the likeness (parable, similitude) of those who disbelieve in their Lord - their works are as ashes whereon the wind blows fiercely on a stormy day. They have no control of aught that they have earned - That is the extreme failure (or far straying).
Do not you see that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth? If He please He can remove you (take you off) and bring (replace you with) a new creation;
That is for Allah no great matter.
They will all come forth unto their Lord; and the despised (or weak) say to those who were scornful (or inflated with pride), "We were but followers of your s, can you now avail us aught against Allah's torment?" They say, "If Allah had guided us we would have guided you. It is now the same for us whether we rage or whether we are penitent, we have no escape."
And Satan says, when the affair is decided, "Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth; I, too, promised and failed you. I had no authority over you, except to call you, and you did hearken unto me; then blame me not, but blame yourselves; I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I disbelieved before in your associating me as partner with Allah (or rebelled against Allah with whom you associated me as partner); verily, for wrong-doers there must be grievous woe!"
But those who believe and do right will enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever by the permission of their Lord; their salutation therein is "Peace! (tranquillity, security, harmony)"
Do you not see how Allah strikes out a parable? A goodly Saying is like a goodly tree whose root is set firm, and whose branches reach into the heavens; 
It gives its fruit at every season by the permission of its Lord - Allah strikes out parables for men that per chance (or possibly) they may reflect (or be mindful).
And the similitude of a bad saying is as a bad tree, which is felled from above the earth, possessing no stability. 
Allah answers (confirms, establishes) those who believe with the firm (sure) word in the life of this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah leads the wrong-doers astray; for Allah does what He will.
Do not you see those who have exchanged Allah's favours for disbelief, and have led their people to the House of Perdition?
Into Hell? They shall broil therein - an ill resting-place!
And they made peers for Allah, to lead men astray from His path. Say, "Enjoy yourselves, for, verily, your destination is the Fire."
Say to my servants who believe, that they be steadfast in prayer and expend in charity of what We have bestowed upon them, in secret and in public, before there comes the Day when there shall be no bargaining (buying and selling, barter) and no befriending.
Allah it is who created the heavens and the earth; and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you; and subjected to you the ships, to float therein upon the sea at His bidding; and made of service for you the rivers; 
And makes the sun and the moon constant in their course, to be of service to you; and made of service for you the night and the day;
And He gives you of everything you asked of Him: and if you try to number Allah's favours, you cannot count them; - verily, man is persistently unjust and ungrateful.
And when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this land safe, and turn me and my sons away from serving idols! 
"My Lord, verily, they have led many men astray; but he who follows me, verily, he is of me; but he who rebels against me - still you are Forgiving, Merciful!
"O our Lord! Verily, I have settled some of my seed (posterity) in a valley without corn (uncultivable), near Thy Sacred House (the valley of Mecca). O our Lord! That they may establish proper worship, so make the heart of men yearn towards them, and provide them with fruits in order that they may give thanks.
"O my Lord! Verily, Thou knowest what we hide and what we proclaim; for naught is hid from Allah in the earth or in the heavens. 
Praise be to Allah Who hath bestowed on me in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac! - Verily, my Lord is Hearer of Prayer.
"O my Lord! Make me steadfast in proper worship and of my seed likewise! O our Lord! And accept my prayer! 
"O our Lord! Cover us with Thy Forgiveness, me and my parents and all believers on the Day when the reckoning is established."
So think not Allah careless of what the unjust do; He only respites them until the day on which all eyes shall stare in horror!
Running on, necks outstretched, heads uplifted, their gaze returned to them, and their heart void; 
And warn mankind of the Day when the Wrath shall reach them: then those who have done wrong shall say, "O our Lord! Respite us for a short term longer, and we will respond to Thy call, and follow the Messengers!" - "What! Did you not used to swear before that you should suffer no decline?"
"And you dwelt in the dwellings of those who had wronged their own souls; and it was made plain to you how We dealt with them; and We struck out many parables for you." 
But they plotted mighty stratagems, but their stratagem were within Allah's sight, although their stratagem were mountain-shaking.
So think not that Allah fails in his promise to His Messengers. Verily, Allah is Mighty, the Lord of Retribution.
On the day when the earth shall be changed for another earth, and the heavens too; and all shall come forth unto Allah, the One, the Almighty.
You shall see the guilty on that day bound together in chains;
With garments of pitch, and fire covering their faces;
That Allah may reward each soul according to what it has earned. Verily, Allah is swift at reckoning!
This is a clear message to be delivered to mankind that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that only He is Allah, the One, and that men of understanding may take heed.
ALIF LAM RA. Those are the ayats (signs or verses) of Revelation and of a clear Reading (Quran) (or that clarifies).
Many a time will those who disbelieve wish they had surrendered (obeyed or been Muslims). 
Leave them to eat and enjoy the good things of life and let hope beguile them, but they shall come to know!
We never did destroy a community but there was a fixed term decreed for it.
No nation can hasten on its appointed time, nor put it off.
But they say, "O you to whom the Reminder (the Quran) has been sent down! Verily, you are possessed.
"Why do you not bring us the angels if you do tell the truth?"
We sent not down the angels save as a Fact (for a just or right cause, effect or reason); but then (if We did) they would have no respite.
Verily, We have revealed (sent down) the Reminder, and, verily, We are its Guardian.
We, verily, sent Messengers before you among the sects of men in past ages. 
But there never came a messenger to them but they did mock him. 
Even so do We let it traverse the heart of the guilty.
They will not believe therein, though the example of those of past times is before them.
But had We opened to them a Gate of Heaven and they had continued to ascend through it,
They would only say, "Our eye-sight is only intoxicated; nay, we have been bewitched by sorcery (or hypnotized)!"
And We have placed in the sky the Signs of the Zodiac (or mansions or constellations of stars), and have made them beautiful to the beholders; 
And We have guarded them from every accursed (rejected, pelted) devil (or evil spirit); 
But any that steal a hearing, there follows him a bright flaming fire (or shooting star).
And the earth have We spread out and placed on it firm mountains, and have caused to grow upon it of everything in balanced measure. 
And We have made for you means of livelihood therein, and for those for whom you provide not (or for whom you are not responsible).
Nor is there aught but the treasuries (storehouses) of it are with Us, and We do not send it down save in a noted quantity (ascertainable measure).
And We send forth the impregnating (fertilizing, invigorating, fecundating) winds, and We send down water from the sky, and We give it to you to drink. It is not you who hold the store thereof.
And We, verily, We quicken and kill; and We are of all things the Inheritor.
And We already know the foremost of you, and We know the laggards.
And, verily, it is your Lord who will gather you; verily, He is Wise, Aware.
And We did create man from potter's (or sound emitting) clay of black mud wrought into form.
And the jinn We created before of smokeless fire (or scorched wind).
When your Lord said to the angels, "Verily, I am creating a mortal from (sound-emitting) clay of black mud wrought into shape; 
So when I have fashioned it, and breathed into it of My Spirit, then fall you down before him, prostrating yourselves before him (in obeisance)."
So the angels fell prostrate in obeisance, all of them together, 
Save Iblis, who refused to be among the prostrate.
He said, "O Iblis! What ails you that you are not among the prostrate?"
Said he, "Why should I prostrate myself before a mortal whom you have created from potter's (sound emitting) clay of black mud wrought into form."
He said, "Then get you forth from hence, for verily, you are an outcast (rejected, accursed, pelted).
"And, verily, the curse shall be upon you  until the Day of Judgment."
Said he, "O my Lord! Reprieve me until the day when they shall be raised." 
He said, "Then, verily, you are of the reprieved 
Until the Day of the Appointed Time."
He said, "O my Lord! Because you have put me in the wrong I will surely make wrong seemly for them on earth, and I will put them all in the wrong; 
"Save such of your servants as are sincere and purified."
Said He, "This is a Straight Way which leads to Me (or is incumbent upon Me). 
Verily, over My servants you have no authority, save such of the misguided (or rebellious) as follow you.
And, verily, hell is promised to them all. 
It has seven gates (entrances); to each gate (entrance) is assigned a certain class (or portion)."
Verily, those who fear Allah shall dwell amidst gardens and springs:
(It will be said to them) "Enter you therein in peace and safety!" 
And We will strip off whatever ill-feeling is in their breasts; as brethren they rest on couches face to face.
No toil shall touch them therein, nor shall they be expelled there from.
Inform my servants that I am the Forgiving, the Merciful; 
And that My doom is a grievous doom.
And inform them concerning Abraham's guests,
When they came unto him and said, "Peace!", he said, "Verily, we are afraid of you."
They said, "Be not afraid! Verily, we bring you glad tidings of a boy possessing wisdom." 
He said, "Do you bring me this glad tidings when old age has overtaken me? Of what then do you bring good tidings!" 
They said, "We bring you glad tidings in truth, then be not of those who despair!"
He said, "Who would despair of the mercy of his Lord save those who err?" 
He said, "What then is your business, O you messengers?" 
They said, "Verily, we are sent unto a people deeply in guilt; 
"Save only the household (family or adherents) of Lot, all of them we are certainly charged to save, 
"Except his wife, of whom we have ascertained that she shall be of those who stay behind."
And when the messengers came unto the adherents of Lot, 
He said, "Verily, you are a people whom I recognize not (or of uncommon appearance)."
They said, "Yea, we have come to you to accomplish that whereof they keep disputing. 
"And we bring you the truth (or the inevitable), and, verily, we are truth-tellers! 
"Travel then with your household in the deep darkness of the night, and follow you their rear; and let not any one of you turn round to look back; but go on to where you are commanded."
And We made plain for him the decree that the uttermost one of these people should be cut off on the morrow.
Then the people of the city came, glad at the tidings (of the arrival of the young men). 
Said Lot, "Verily, these are my guests, therefore disgrace me not; 
"But fear Allah, and put me not to shame."
They said, "Have we not forbidden you to speak for all in the world?" 
He said, "Here are my daughters, if do it you must."- 
By your life (O Muhammad)! In their frenzy of intoxication (passion) they went blindly (distractedly) to and fro.
And the mighty blast caught them at dawn.
And We turned their cities upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay. 
Behold! In this is a sign to those who by tokens understand (or can read the signs).
And, verily, the cities were on a high road that still remains. 
Verily, in this is a sign for those who believe.
And the companions of the Wood (Midian), too, were unjust; 
And We took vengeance on them, and, verily, they were both on an open highway, plain to see.
And the companions of Al-Hijr (the Rocky Tract) also rejected the messengers.
And We brought them Our revelations, but they did turn away there from. 
And they used to hew out dwellings from the mountain to dwell in safety.
But the mighty blast seized them in the morning; 
And that which they counted as gain availed them naught.
We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them both, save with truth. And, verily, the Hour is surely coming; then do you forgive with a gracious forgiveness.
Verily, your Lord He is the Master Creator, the All-knowing.
We have already given you the Seven Oft-Repeated (the verses of the first chapter of the Quran), and the mighty Quran.
Let not your eyes strain after what We have allowed certain classes among them to enjoy, nor grieve for them; but lower your wing (in tenderness) to the believers,
And say, "Verily, I, even I, am a plain Warner."
Such as We sent down for those who make divisions,
Those who break the Quran into separate parts.
Them, by your Lord! We shall question, one and all,
About what they used to do.
Therefore, proclaim what you are commanded, and withdraw from the idolaters.
Verily, We are enough defence for you against the scoffers.
Who place other gods along with Allah; but they at length shall come to know! 
And well know We that your breast was at times oppressed by what they say.
But hymn the praises of your Lord, and be you of those who make prostrations (or obeisance).
And serve your Lord until there comes unto you the Hour that is certain (death).
The Command of Allah will inevitably come to pass; seek not then to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they join with Him.
He sends down the angels with the Spirit at His command upon whom He will of His servants, saying, "Give warning that there is no God but Me; therefore, fear (do your duty to) Me." 
He created the heavens and the earth with truth! Exalted is He above all that which they join with Him!
He created man from a drop (of sperm); and yet, behold, he is an open opponent!
The cattle too have We created for you; in them is warmth (clothing) and profit (benefits, uses) and from them do you eat.
In them there is beauty for you when you drive them home to rest, and when you drive them forth to pasture.
And they bear your heavy burdens to lands which you could not otherwise reach, except with souls distressed; - verily, your Lord is Kind and Merciful.
And horses too, and mules, and asses, for you to ride upon and for an ornament. He has creates also that which you know not.
(Unto or For Allah) is the direction of the Straight Way; from it some turn aside (or are not straight): but had He pleased He would have led you all straight.
He it is who sends down water from the sky, whence you have drink, and whence the trees grow whereby you feed your flocks.
He makes the corn to grow, and the olives, and the palms, and the grapes, and all kinds of other fruit; - verily, herein is indeed a sign for a people who reflect.
And He subjected to you the night and the day, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars are subjected to His command. Verily, in these are signs to a people who have sense (sensibility or wisdom).
And what He has produced for you in the earth varying in hue (colours and qualities), verily, in that is a sign for a people who are mindful (aware. remembering, grateful).
He it is who has subjected the sea, that you may eat fresh flesh there from; and you bring forth from it ornaments which you wear,- and you may see the ships cleaving through it, and that you may search after His Bounty, and per chance (or possibly) you may give thanks.
And He has cast firm mountains on the earth lest it shake with you; and rivers and roads; per chance (or possibly) you may be guided.
And landmarks; and by the stars too are they guided.
Is He who creates like him who creates not? Will you then not remember (be mindful, aware)?
But if you would number the favours of Allah, you cannot count them. Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah knows what you keep secret (or hidden), and what you disclose (or proclaim).
And those on whom you call beside Allah cannot create anything, for they are themselves created,
Dead, not living, nor can they know when they shall be raised.
Your God is one God, and those who believe not in the Hereafter their heart are given to denial, and they are inflated with pride!
Without a doubt Allah knows what you keep secret and what you disclose. Verily, He loves not those inflated with pride.
And when it is said to them, "What is it that your Lord has revealed (sent down)?" they say, "Old folks' tales!"
Let them bear the burden of their sins in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also some of the burdens of those whom they led astray without knowledge. Alas! How grievous is the burden they shall bear!
Those who were before them plotted, but Allah struck at the foundations of their building, and the roof fell on them from above, and the torment came to them, from whence they could not perceive.
Then on the Day of Resurrection He will put them to shame, and say, "Where are My associates about whom you were divided into parties?" Those endowed with knowledge will say, "Verily, to-day disgrace, and evil cover the disbelievers,
"Those whom the angels take away while they are wronging their own souls." Then will they offer peace and surrender, saying "We have done no evil (knowingly)." (The reply will be) "Nay! Surely Allah knows what you used to do.
"So enter you the doors of hell, to dwell therein; ill, indeed, is the resort of the arrogant."
And it will be said to those who fear Allah (the righteous), "What is it that your Lord has revealed (sent down)?" They will say, "All that is good." For those who do good, there is good in this world; but certainly the abode of the Hereafter is better; and surely excellent is the abode of the righteous (or those who fear).
Gardens of Eternity which they shall enter, beneath which rivers flow; therein shall they have what they please; - thus does Allah reward those who fear Him (or repel evil).
To those whom the angels take away in a goodly state (those who die righteous) they shall say, "Peace be upon you! Enter you into the Garden (Paradise) for that which you have done."
Do they expect other than that the angels should come to take them away, or that your Lord's command should come to pass? Even so did those before them; Allah did not wrong them; but it was themselves they wronged.
So that the evil which they had done smote them, and that which they mocked surrounded (imprisoned, restricted, hemmed them in).
And the idolaters (those who associated others with Allah) said, "Had Allah pleased we had not served aught beside Him, neither we nor our fathers; nor had we forbidden aught without His permission". Even so did those before them. Are the messengers charged to do anything but to deliver their message clearly?
Verily, We have sent to every nation a Messenger, proclaiming, "Serve you Allah, and avoid Taghut (false gods)." And amongst them are some whom Allah has guided, and amongst them are some for whom error has become established. So travel through the earth, and behold what was the end of those who denied them.
If you are eager for their guidance, verily, Allah guides not those who go astray (or mislead), nor have they any helpers.
They swear by their strongest oath, "Allah will not raise up him who dies."- Nay! But it is a promise binding on Him in truth. But most know not.
(It is) To explain to them that which they disputed about, and that those who disbelieved may know that they are liars.
We only say unto a thing We intend, the Word, "BE," and it is.
But those who fled their homes for Allah's sake, after they were wronged (oppressed), We will surely establish them in this world with good things; but truly the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if you did but know,
Those who are patient, and put their trust (or reliance) upon their Lord, 
And We have not sent before you any but men, whom We inspired - Ask you those who possess the Reminder (or the Message), if you know not yourselves,
With Manifest (clear) Signs and with Books of Prophecy; and We have sent down the Reminder to you too, that you may explain to men clearly what has been sent down to them, and that they may reflect.
Are those, who devise evil plots, secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up, or that His Wrath will not seize them from whence they cannot perceive.
Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their going to and fro, without the possibility of frustrating Him? 
Or that He should seize them with a gradual wasting? Verily, your Lord is indeed Kind, Merciful.
Do they not look at Allah's creations, even among (inanimate things) - how their shadows turn to the right or the left, in prostration (obeisance or submission) to Allah and they are humble (or shrinking)?
And unto Allah does prostration (obeisance) whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, whether living creature or angel; nor are they arrogant (inflated with pride).
They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.
And Allah says, "Take not two gods; He is only one God; then fear Me, and Me alone."
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, and to Him is duty (obedience) due unceasingly (or religion is for Him fundamentally and forever). Will you then fear other than Allah?
And whatever favours you enjoy, they are from Allah; then, whenever distress touches you, unto Him you turn for succour. 
Yet, when He removes the distress from you, lo! A party of you join partners with their Lord.
That they may deny that which We have given them. Then enjoy life while you may, for at length you shall come to know the truth.
And they set aside a portion of what We have bestowed upon them for what they know not. By Allah! You shall certainly be questioned concerning that which you have devised.
They assign for Allah daughters - Glory be to Him - and for themselves they desire them not (or desire sons).
When any one of them receives tidings of a female child, his face is over clouded and black, and he is filled with inner wrath.
He skulks away from the people, for the evil tidings he has heard; - is he to keep it with its disgrace, or to bury it in the dust? - Ah! How evil is their judgment (or choice)!
For those who believe not in the Hereafter is there is an evil similitude: but Allah's is the Sublime Similitude; for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
If Allah were to punish men for their wrong-doing He would not leave upon the earth a single living creature; but He reprieves them until an appointed time; and when their time comes they cannot put it off an hour, nor can they advance it.
They assign to Allah what they abhor themselves; and their tongues expound the lie that all good is to be theirs." Without a doubt theirs is the Fire, for, verily, they shall be abandoned therein.
By Allah! We verily sent messengers unto the nations before you, but Satan made their works fair-seeming unto them. So he is their patron this day, and for them is grievous doom!
We have revealed the Book unto you only that you may explain unto them that wherein they differ, and as a guidance and a mercy to a people who have faith.
And Allah sends down water from the sky, and quickens therewith the earth after its death; verily, in that is a sign to a people who can hear.
Verily, you have in cattle a lesson; We give you to drink from that which is in their belly, betwixt excretions and blood, pure milk, agreeable for drinkers.
And of the fruit of the palms and the grapes you derive drinks and goodly nourishment; verily, in that is a sign to a people who have sense!
And your Lord inspired the bee, "Take to habitations in the mountains and in the trees, and in the habitations of men.
"Then eat from every fruit, and walk in the beaten paths of your Lord". There comes forth from her body a draught varying in hue, in which is a healing for mankind. Verily, herein are, indeed, signs unto a people who reflect.
Allah created you; then He will take you to Himself; but amongst you are some whom He will thrust into the most decrepit stage of life, so that he may not know aught that once he knew. Verily, Allah is Knower, Powerful.
And Allah has bestowed his gifts of provisions more freely on some of you over others; but those who have been preferred will not restore their provision to those whom their right hands possess that they may share equally therein: - is it Allah's favours they deny?
And Allah has made for you mates of your own nature, and has made for you from them sons and daughters and grandchildren; and has provided you with sustenance of the best things; - is it, then in vanity that they believe, while for Allah's favour they are ungrateful?
And they serve beside Allah what cannot control for them any provision from the heavens or the earth, nor have they any power.
Do not then coin similitudes for Allah! Verily, Allah knows, but you know not.
Allah coins a similitude (or parable); (On the one hand) a slave owned by another, having control over nothing, and (on the other hand) one on whom We have bestowed a goodly favours from Us, and who spends there from freely secretly and openly - shall they be held equal? Praise be to Allah, but most of them understand not.
And Allah coins another similitude (parable): two men, one of them dumb, able to do nothing, a burden to his lord; wherever he directs him he brings no success; is he to be held equal with him who bids what is just and who is on the Straight Way?
To Allah belongs the Mystery of the heavens and the earth. And the Decision of the Hour (of Judgment) is but as the twinkling of an eye, or even quicker. Verily, Allah has power over all things.
Allah brings you forth out of the wombs of your mothers knowing naught; and He gives you hearing, and sight, and heart, that you may give thanks.
Do they not see the birds subservient in the vault of the sky? None holds them in but Allah: verily, in that is a sign unto a people who believe.
Allah made for you habitations, homes of repose; and made for you, of the skins of cattle, dwellings (tents), that you may find them light on the day you move your quarters and the day when you abide; and from their wool and from their fur, and from their hair come furnishings and chattels for a season.
And Allah has made for you, out what He has created, shade; and has made for you shelters in the mountains; and He has made for you garments to protect you from the heat, and coats of mail to keep you from each other's violence: - thus does He fulfil His favours towards you, per chance (or possibly) you yet may surrender to His Will (i.e. in Islam).
But if they turn their backs, your duty is only to convey the Clear Message.
They recognize the favours of Allah, and then they deny them, for most men are ungrateful.
On the Day We shall raise from all peoples a witness; then shall no excuse be accepted from disbelievers, and they shall receive no favours (or be allowed to make amends).
And when those who did wrong see the Penalty, it will not be mitigated, nor will they receive respite.
And when those who join partners with Allah behold those partners, they will say, "Our Lord! These are your partners on whom we used to invoke beside Thee." And they shall throw back the words at them, "Verily, you are liars!" 
And they shall proffer unto Allah surrender that day; and all that which they had devised shall stray away from them.
Those who disbelieve and turn folks from the path of Allah, We will add doom to their doom, for that they worked corruption.
And on the day when We will raise up in every nation a witness against them from among themselves, and We will bring you (Muhammad) as a witness against these (your people or the other witnesses); for We have revealed (sent down) to you a Book (Scripture) expounding all things clearly, and a guidance, and a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have Surrendered unto Allah (Muslims).
Verily, Allah commands justice, the doing of good (kindness, benevolence), and liberality to kindred, and He forbids all shameful deeds (lewdness, abomination, perversity) and wickedness (wrong, injustice, oppression, rebellion); He exhorts you that per chance (or possibly) you may be mindful.
Fulfil the Covenant of Allah when you have entered into it, and break not your oaths after confirming them, for you thereby make Allah your surety; verily, Allah knows what you do.
And be not like her who unravels her yarn, fraying it out after she hath spun it close, by taking your oaths for mutual intrigue, because one nation is more numerous than another; Allah only tries you therewith, but He will make manifest to you on the Day of Judgment that whereon you disagree.
But had Allah pleased He would have made you one nation; but He leads astray whom He will, and guides whom He will; - but you shall be questioned as to that which you used to do.
Take not therefore your oaths for mutual deceit, lest a foot slip after being planted firmly, and you taste of evil in that you turned folks off the path of Allah, and your s should be a mighty doom.
And sell not the Covenant of Allah for a little price; Verily, with Allah alone is that which is better for you, if you did but know.
What you have is spent (wastes away), but what Allah has endures; and verily, We will recompense the patient (steadfast) in proportion to the best of what they used to do.
Whoever acts aright, male or female, and is a believer, We will quicken with a goodly life; and We will recompense them in proportion to the best of what they used to do.
When you do read the Quran ask refuge with Allah from Satan the outcast (the rejected or pelted one).
Verily, he has no power over those who believe and who upon their Lord rely (trust). 
His power is only over those who take him for a patron, and over the idolaters.
And whenever We change one revelation for another - Allah knows best what He reveals (sends down) - They say, "You are but inventing!"- Nay, most of them know not. 
Say, "The Holy Spirit brought it down from your Lord in truth, that it may confirm (the faith of) those who believe, and for a guidance and glad tidings to those who have Surrendered unto Allah (Muslims)."
We know well that they say, "It is only some mortal who teaches him." But the tongue of him they point to (Muhammad) is outlandish, while this (Quran) is Arabic, pure and clear.
Verily, those who believe not in Allah's signs, Allah will not guide them, and for them is grievous woe.
Only they are the inventors who believe not in Allah's signs; and these, they are the liars.
Whoever disbelieves in Allah after having believed - unless it be one who is forced and whose heart is still content in the faith - but whoever expands his breast to (easing) disbelieve - on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs is a mighty doom.
That is because they preferred the love of the life of this world to the Hereafter, and because Allah guides not unbelieving people. 
These are they whose heart, and hearing, and sight, Allah has sealed, and these, they are the heedless.
Assuredly, in the Hereafter they will be the losers.
Then, verily, your Lord - to those who fled after they had been tried, and then fought strenuously and were patient, - verily, your Lord after that will be Forgiving and Merciful.
On the Day when every soul will come to plead for itself, every soul shall be paid what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged.
Allah coins a similitude (parable): a city which was safe and content, its provision came to it in plenty from every place, and then it denied (was ungrateful for) Allah's favours, and Allah made it feel the garb of dearth and fear, because of that which the used to do.
And there came to them a messenger from amongst themselves, but they called him a liar, so the torment seized them, while yet they were unjust.
Eat, then, from what Allah has provided you, things lawful and good, and give thanks for the favours of Allah, if it be Him you serve.
He has only forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is devoted to other than Allah; but he who is driven thereto (forced by necessity), neither craving nor transgressing due limits, then verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And say not of what your own tongues pronounce, the lie "This is lawful, and this is unlawful," inventing against Allah a lie; verily, those who invent against Allah a lie shall not prosper.
A brief enjoyment for them - then a grievous woe!
For those who are Jews We have forbidden what We have already narrated to you. We wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong themselves.
Then, verily, your Lord - for those who do evil in ignorance and afterwards repent and amend - verily, your Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
Verily, Abraham was indeed, a model, devoutly obedient to Allah, by nature upright, and he was not of the idolaters: 
Thankful for His favours; He chose him and He guided him unto the Straight Way.
And We gave him in this world good things; and, verily, in the Hereafter he is among the righteous.
Then We inspired you (Muhammad) saying, "Follow the religion of Abraham, as one by nature upright. He was not of the idolaters."
The Sabbath was only made (strict) for those who dispute thereon; but, verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment concerning that whereon they do dispute.
Call unto the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and reason with them in the best (kindest, most gracious, elegant, persuasive) way; verily, your Lord He knows best who has erred from His way, and He is best aware of those who receive guidance.
But if you punish (or catch them out), punish (or catch them out) only with the like of that with which you were afflicted; but if you endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient.
Endure you patiently. Your endurance is only by the help of Allah. Grieve not about them; and be not distressed because of that which they devise.
Verily, Allah is with those who fear (do their duty to) Him, and with those who do good.
Glorified be He Who carried His servant on a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Remote Mosque, the neighbourhood of which We have blessed, to show him of Our Signs. Verily, He is the Hearer and the Seer.
And We gave Moses the Book (Scripture) and made it a guidance to the Children of Israel, saying: "Take you no guardian besides Me."
(They were) The seed of those We carried with Noah (in the ark). Verily, he was a thankful servant!
And We clearly warned the Children of Israel in the Book, "You shall verily do evil in the earth twice, and you shall become great tyrants (or elated with pride)."
And when the first of the two came, We sent against you Our servants given to great violence. They entered the inner most parts of your homes; and it was a fulfiled warning.
Then We rallied you once more against them, and aided you with resources and sons, and made you a numerous band.
If you do well, you do well to your own souls; and if you do evil, you do it against your own souls. And when the second warning came, We permitted your enemies to disfigure your faces and to enter your Temple as they had entered it the first time, and to destroy all that fell into their hands."
It may be that your Lord will yet have mercy on you. But if you revert to wrongdoing We will revert to punishment, and We have made Hell a prison for the faithless.
Verily, this Quran does guide to the Straight Way, and gives glad tidings to the believers who do work righteousness, that for them is a great reward.
And that for those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have prepared a mighty doom.
Man prays for evil as (or when) he prays for good (or he makes his prayer evil or prays for evil when it should be for good); for man was ever hasty (or impatient or superficial).
We made the night and the day two signs; and We make dark the sign of the night and make the sign of the day sight-giving, that you may seek the bounty of your Lord, and that you may calculate the years and the reckoning; and We have expounded everything in detail.
And every man's augury (fate) have We fastened on his own neck; and We will bring forth for him on the Day of Judgment a book offered to him wide open.
(It will be said to him) "Read your book. Your soul suffices as reckoner against you this day."
He who accepts guidance (or does right), accepts it only for his own soul: and he who errs, errs only against it; nor shall one burdened soul bear the burden of another. Nor would We punish until we had sent a Messenger (with warnings).
And when We desire to destroy a people We send commands to the opulent ones thereof who yet work abomination therein; and then due sentence is pronounced; and We destroyed it utterly.
How many generations have We destroyed after Noah. Your Lord is sufficient as Knower and Beholder of the sins of his servant.
Whoever is desirous of this life that soon passes away, We will hasten on for him therein what We please for whom We please. Then We will make hell for him to broil in - despised and outcast (or condemned, disgraced and rejected).
But whoever desires the Hereafter, and strives for it with the necessary effort, for such, their striving shall find favour.
To each do We supply, both these and those (the just and the unjust), from the bounty of your Lord; for the bounty of your Lord are not restricted.
See how We have preferred some of them over others, and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degree and greater in preference.
Set not up with Allah other gods, or you will sit despised and forsaken.
Your Lord has decreed that you serve none other than Him; and that you show kindness to parents. If one or both of them reach old age with you, say not unto them, "Fie!", nor repulse them, but speak to them graciously and kindly. 
And lower to them the wing of humility out of compassion, and say, "O Lord! Have compassion on them both for they did take care of me when I was little!" 
Your Lord is best aware of what is in your souls. If you be righteous, lo! He was ever Forgiving unto those who turn back penitent.
And give your kinsman his due and the needy and the son of the road (wayfarer); and squander (waste) not your wealth in wantonness.
Lo! The squanderers were ever brothers of the devil; and the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.
But if you do turn away from them to seek after mercy from your Lord, which you hope for, then speak to them in easy words (kindly and reasonably).
Let not your hand be fettered to your neck (i.e. selfish and tight fisted), nor yet spread it out quite open, lest you should have to sit down blamed and destitute.
Verily, your Lord spreads out provision to whomsoever He will or He restricts it. Verily, He is ever Knower and Seer of his servants.
And slay not your children for fear of poverty; We will provide for them and for you. Beware! For to slay them is ever a Great Sin.
And draw not near to adultery (and fornication); verily, it is ever an abomination, and evil is the way thereof (it opens the way to other evils).
And slay not the soul that Allah has forbidden you (or made sacred), except for just cause; for he who is slain unjustly We have given authority to his heirs (or kin), yet let him not commit excess in slaying; verily, he will be helped.
And draw not near to the wealth of the orphan, save to improve it, until he reaches the age of puberty, and fulfil your covenants (or agreements, contracts etc.). Verily, every covenant will be inquired into (on the Day of Judgment).
And give full measure when you measure out, and weigh with a right balance; that is better and fairer in the final determination.
And follow (or pursue) not that of which you have no knowledge; verily, the hearing, the sight, and the heart, of all of these it shall be asked (to give an account).
And walk not on the earth proudly (insolently); verily, you can not rend the earth asunder, nor can you stretch to the height of the mountains.
All this evil is abhorrent in the sight of your Lord.
These are among the things of wisdom which your Lord has inspired you with. Take not then with Allah other gods (objects of worship), lest you should be thrown into Hell reproached and outcast (rejected). 
What! Has your Lord preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself daughters from among the angels? Truly, you are uttering a dreadful saying.
Now have We explained in various ways in this Quran in order that they may receive admonition, but it only increases them in naught but aversion (or flight from truth).
Say, "Were there with Him other gods, as you say, then would they seek a way against (or to) the Lord of the Throne."
Glory to Him! High is He, far exalted above all they say.
The seven heavens and the earth, and all that is therein praises Him (declares His Glory), and there is naught but hymns (celebrates, expresses) His praise: but you understand not their praise. Verily, He is Clement and Forgiving.
And when you read the Quran We place between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter an invisible veil (or hidden barrier).
And We place covers upon their heart, lest they should understand it, and deafness in their ears. And when you do mention your Lord alone in the Quran they turn their backs in aversion. 
We know best what they listen for when they give ear to you; and when they whisper apart (or meet in secret or private discussions or conferences) when the wrong-doers say, "You  only follow a man bewitched."
Behold, what similitudes they strike out for you, but they err (or have gone astray), and cannot find the way.
They say, "What! When we have become bones and dust are we to be raised up a new creature?" 
Say, "Be you stones, or iron,
"Or a created thing which, in your mind, is greater (or harder to reproduce) yet you shall be raised" Then they shall say, "Who is to restore us?" Say, "He who originated you at first;" Then they will wag their heads and say, "When will that be?” Say, "It may, perhaps, be soon."
The day when He shall call on you and you shall answer with praise to Him, they will think that they have tarried but a little while.
And tell My servants to speak only that which is best (kindly, reasonably, truthfully, beautifully, usefully to enemy, friend and relative). Truly, Satan does sow dissension (or ill will) among them, for Satan is ever unto man an open foe.
Your Lord is best aware; if He please He will have mercy upon you, or if He please He will punish you. We have not sent you to take charge of them.
And your Lord is best aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth. We preferred (or bestowed on) some of the prophets more (and different gifts) than on others, and to David did We give the Psalms.
Say, "Call on those other than Allah whom you assume to be gods." But they have no power to remove distress from you, nor to change it.
Those on whom they call, themselves seek for a means of approaching to their Lord, to see which of them is nearest: and they hope for His mercy and they fear His doom; verily, the doom of your Lord is to be shunned.
There is no community but We will destroy it before the Day of Judgment, or punish it with dire penalty. That is inscribed in the Eternal Book.
Naught hindered us from sending you with signs, save that those of yore denied them; so We gave Thamud the visible she-camel, but they treated her wrongfully (or ignorantly) and We send not (or any one with) signs save to warn.
And when We said to you, "Verily, your Lord encompasses mankind!" and We granted the Vision which We showed you only as a trial unto men - and also the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Quran (See 44:43-49, 37:62-65); for We put warning (or fright) into them, but it only increase them in gross rebellion.
And when We said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam;" and they bowed, save Iblis, who said, "Am I to bow before one whom Thou hast created out of clay (rigid and inert))?"
Said he, "Do you see this one whom Thou hast honoured above me? Verily, if Thou should reprieve me until the Day of Resurrection (or Judgment), I will of a surety utterly destroy his seed except a few."
He (Allah) said, "Be gone and whoever of them follows you. Verily, hell is your recompense, an ample recompense. 
"Entice away whomever of them you can with your voice; and urge your horse and your foot against them; and share with them in their wealth and their children; and make them promises. But Satan promises them naught but deceit. 
"Verily, over My servants, you have no authority, and your Lord is guardian enough over them!"
It is your Lord who drives the ships for you upon the sea that you may seek of His bounty. Verily, He is ever Merciful towards you.
And when distress touches you in the sea, all those whom you call on fail you, except Him, but when He has brought you safe to shore, you turn away; for man is ever ungrateful.
Are ye, then sure (do you feel secure) that He will not cause a slope of the land to swallow you, or set upon you a heavy sand-storm, and then you will find no protector?
Or are you sure that He will not send you back therein another time, and send against you a violent wind, and drown you for your thanklessness, and then you will find no helper against Us therein. 
But We have been gracious to the children of Adam, and We have borne them by land and sea, and have provided them with good things, and have preferred them over many that We have created.
On the Day when We will summon all men by their record (or leaders or scriptures); and he whose book (of records) is given in his right hand shall read it (with joy), nor shall they be wronged a straw.
But he who in this life is blind shall be blind in the Hereafter, and err farther from the way.
They strove hard to beguile you from what We inspired you with, that you should invent against Us something else, and then they would have taken you for a friend;
And had it not been that We made you firm, you would have almost inclined towards them a little (made concessions, compromises).
Then would We have made you taste of punishment of both of life and death, and you would not have found a helper against Us.
And they wished to scare you away from the land, to drive you forth there from; but then they would not have stayed after you except a little while.
(This is) The way of those of Our prophets whom We have sent before you; and you shall find no change in Our way.
Be you steadfast in prayer from the declining of the sun until the dark of the night, and the recital of the Quran at dawn; verily, the recital of the dawn is especially witnessed (or effective).
And for some part of the night, watch you therein as an extra service (or for spiritual profit). It may be that your Lord will raise you to a praised (or glorious) station.
And say, "O my Lord! Make my entry be by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and make my exit be likewise by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and grant me from Thee an authority to aid me."
And say, "Truth has come, and falsehood has vanished! Verily, falsehood is ever bound to vanish."
And We will send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers, though it only increases the wrong-doers in ruin.
And when We favour man he turns away and is averse, but when evil touches him he is in despair. 
Say, "Every one acts after his own manner, but your Lord is best aware of who is most guided on the way."
They will ask you about the Spirit. Say, "The Spirit is (or comes) by the command of my Lord, and you are given but a little knowledge (or control) thereof."
If We had wished We would have taken away that with which We have inspired you; then you would have found no guardian against us,
Unless by a mercy from your Lord, verily, His grace towards you is great.
Say, "If mankind and jinn united together to bring the like of this Quran, they could not produce its like, though they should help each other."
We have displayed for mankind in this Quran all kinds of similitudes; but most of mankind refuse anything but disbelief.
And they say, "We will by no means believe in you, until you cause to gush forth for us a fountain from the earth; 
Or there be made for you a garden of palms and grapes, and rivers come gushing out amidst them; 
Or you make the sky to fall down upon us in pieces, as you have warned; or you bring us Allah and the angels before us face to face; 
Or there be made for you a house of gold; or you climb up into the heaven; and even then We will not believe in your climbing there, until you send down on us a book that we may read!"  Say, "Glory to my Lord! Am I aught but a mortal, a Messenger?"
Naught prevents men from believing when the guidance came to them, save their saying, "Has Allah sent a mortal for a messenger?"
Say, "Had there been on the earth settled angels walking about, then We would surely have sent them an angel as a messenger."
Say, "Allah is sufficient witness between me and you; verily, He is Knower, Seer of His servants."
He whom Allah guides, he is indeed guided; and he whom Allah leads astray, you shall never find patrons for them beside Him; and We will assemble them on the Day of Resurrection upon their faces, blind, and dumb, and deaf; their resort is Hell; whenever it grows dull We will increase the flame for them.
That is their reward for that they disbelieved in Our revelations, and said, "What! When we are bones and dust, shall we then be raised up a new creation?"
Could they not see that Allah who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them, and to set for them an appointed time; there is no doubt therein? Yet the wrong-doers refuse to accept it, save ungratefully!
Say, "If you did control the treasuries of the mercy of my Lord, then you would hold them back for fear of spending; for man is ever niggardly!"
And We did bring Moses nine manifest signs; but ask the children of Israel how he came to them, and Pharaoh said to him, "Verily, I think, O Moses! You are bewitched."
He said, "In truth you know well that none sent down these signs save the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs; and, verily, O Pharaoh! I think you are doomed to ruin."
And he desired to drive them out of the land; but We drowned him and those with him, one and all.
And after him We said to the children of Israel, "Dwell you secure in the land (of promise)"; but when the promise of the Hereafter (or the second warning) comes to pass, We will bring you back as a crowd gathered out of various nations.
With truth have We sent it (the Quran) down, and with truth has it descended; and We have not sent you as ought but a herald of glad tidings and a Warner.
And it is a Quran which We have divided, that you may read it to mankind at intervals, and We have revealed it by successive revelations."
Say, "Believe you therein, or believe not; verily, those who were given the knowledge before it, when it is read to them fall down prostrate upon their faces, adoring,
Saying, "Glory to our Lord! Verily, the promise of our Lord is ever fulfiled"
They fall down upon their faces weeping, and it increases their humility.
Say, "Call unto Allah, or call on Rahman (the Beneficent), unto whichever you call it is the same; for His are the most beautiful names." And do not say your prayers loud-voiced, nor yet silently, but seek a way between these.
And say, "Praise belongs to Allah, who has not taken to Himself a son, and He has no partner in the Sovereignty (or Dominion), nor needs He a patron to protect Him from such abasement (or from humiliation)." And magnify Him for His greatness and glory.
Praise be to Allah, who sent down to His servant the Book, and allowed no crookedness therein,
(He made it) Straight, to give warning of stern punishment from Him; and to give the glad tidings to the believers, who do what is right, that for them is a goodly reward,
Wherein they shall abide forever.
And to give warning to those who say, "Allah has begotten a son."
That they have no knowledge thereof, nor had their fathers. Dreadful is the word that comes forth from their mouths. Verily, they speak naught but a lie.
Yet it may be that you (Muhammad) will torment your soul with grief (or fret thyself to death) if they believe not in this new revelation. 
Verily, We have placed all that which is on the earth as an ornament thereof, that We may try them, which of them is best in conduct.
But, verily, We shall make all that which is thereon a barren mound.
Have you considered that the Fellows of the Cave and of the Inscription are a wonder amongst Our Signs?
When the youths fled for refuge to the cave and said, "Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Thee, and dispose of our affair rightly (or lead us to conduct ourselves rightly)."
And We struck their ears (with deafness) in the cave for a number of years. 
Then We raised them up again, that We might know which of the two parties could best calculate the time of their tarrying. 
We narrate to you their story in truth. Verily, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We added to their guidance, 
And We strengthened their heart, when they stood up and said, "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, never will we call upon any god beside Him, for then we should have said an extravagant thing. 
"These people of ours have taken to other gods beside Him. Though they do not bring any manifest authority for them. And who is more unjust than he who invents against Allah falsehoods?
"So when you have gone apart from them and what they serve other than Allah, then resort you to the cave. Our Lord will unfold His mercy to you, and will dispose for you your affair advantageously."
And you might have seen the sun, when it rose, decline from their cave towards the right hand, and when it set leave them on the left hand, while they were in the spacious part thereof. That is one of the Signs of Allah. Whom Allah guides he is guided indeed, and whom He leads astray you shall surely find for him no patron to the Right Way.
You  would have deemed them waking though they were asleep, as We turned them towards the right and towards the left; and their dog spreading out his fore-paws on the threshold.
Had you come suddenly upon them you would surely have turned and fled away from them, and would surely have been filled by them with terror.
Thus did We raise them up that they might question each other. A speaker from amongst them said, "How long have you tarried?" They said, "We have tarried perhaps a day or part of a day." Others said, "Allah knows best how long you have been here. Now send one of you with this money of your s to the city, and let him look for the best food, and let him bring it to you that you may satisfy your hunger. And let him behave with subtlety (unobtrusively or with care and courtesy) and let no one perceive you (or let no one know about you). 
"For should they perceive you, they would stone you, or would force you back again unto their faith, and you would never prosper (or succeed)."
Thus did We make their people acquainted with their story, that they might know that Allah's promise is true; and that the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When they (the people of the city) disputed amongst themselves concerning their affair, and said, "Build a building over them, their Lord knows best about them;" and those who prevailed in this affair said, "We will surely build a place of worship over them."
Some say, "They were three, and the fourth of them was their dog:" and some say, "Five, and the sixth of them was their dog:" guessing at the unseen: and some say, "Seven, and the eighth of them was their dog." Say, "My Lord knows best the number of them; none knows them but a few. Enter not, therefore, into disputation concerning the matter, except what is clear, and consult not any one of them to pronounce concerning them.
And never say of anything, "Verily, I am going to do that to-morrow," 
Except (by adding) "If Allah please;" and remember your Lord when you have forgotten, and say, "It may be that my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to the right way."
So they stayed in their cave three hundred years and (some add) nine more. 
Say, "Allah knows best how long they stayed. His are the unseen things of the heavens and the earth. How clear of Sight is He, and how keen of Hearing!" They have no patron beside Him, nor does He let any one share in His Sovereignty (or Command or Judgment or Government).
So, recite that which has been revealed (or inspired) unto you of the Book from your Lord. There is no changing (or none can change) His words; nor shall you ever find a refuge beside Him.
Restrain thyself with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, desiring His countenance (or nearness and intimacy), and let not your eyes be turned from them, desiring the adornment (and pomp) of the life of this world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, and who follows his own lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions), and whose affair has been abandoned.
But say, "The truth is from your Lord, so let him who will, believe; and let him who will, disbelieve." Verily, We have prepared for the evildoers a Fire, sheets of which shall encompass them; and if they cry for help, they shall be helped with water like molten lead which roasts their faces - how dreadful a drink and how ill a couch!
Verily, those who believe and act righteously - verily, We suffer not the reward of him whose work is goodly to be wasted.
For such are gardens of Eden; beneath them rivers flow; they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and shall wear green robes of finest silk, and of gold brocade; reclining therein on thrones - blessed is the reward, and goodly the couch!
Strike out for them a Similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We have assigned two gardens of grapes, and surrounded them both with date-palms, and put corn-fields (or tilled fields) between the two. 
Each of the two gardens brought forth its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gush forth therein.
And he had abundant fruit, and he said unto his neighbour (or companion) in the course of mutual discussion (or argument), "I am much wealthier than you, and mightier in men (with more honour and power)."
And he went in unto his garden, having thus wronged himself: said he, "I do not think that all this will ever perish.
And I think not that the Hour (of Judgment) will ever come; and even if I be sent back unto my Lord, I shall surely find something even better in exchange."
His neighbour, while he disputed with him, exclaimed, "Disbelieve you in Him who created you from dust, and then from a drop, then fashioned you into a man?
But He is Allah, my Lord; and I associate no partner with my Lord. 
"Why could you not have said when you did enter into your garden, 'As Allah pleases! (Or It is Allah's will or Allah's will always comes to pass). There is no power save in Allah!'. Though you see me as less than you in wealth and children;
"It may be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and will send upon it a bolt from heaven, and it shall be but bare slippery mud on the morrow. 
"Or some morning the water thereof will be deeply sunk in the earth so that you can not get thereat."
And his fruits were beset (with ruin). Then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent thereon, for now it had crumbled down to its foundations. And he said, "Would that I had ascribed no partner with my Lord!"
And he had no troop of men to help him against Allah, nor could he save himself.
In such a case the patronage is Allah's alone, the True; He is best at rewarding and best for consequences (or success).
Strike out for them, also, a similitude of the life of this world; like water, which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth absorbs it; but on the morrow (or soon) it is dried up, and the winds scatter it; for Allah is powerful over all things.
Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world; but good works which endure are better with your Lord, for recompense, and better for hope.
And (think about) the Day when We will remove the mountains, and you shall see the whole earth emerging (or laid level); and We will gather them all, leaving out none. 
Then shall they be presented to your Lord in ranks - Now have you come to Us (bare) as We created you at first! Aye, but you thought that We would never fulfil Our appointment (with you)!
And the Book (of Deeds) shall be placed, and you shall see the sinners in fear of what is recorded therein; and they will say, "Alas, for us! What a Book is this, it leaves out neither small nor great things, without numbering them?" And they shall find present all what they have done; and your Lord will wrong no one.
And (remember) when We said to the angels, "Fall prostrate in obeisance before Adam," they fell prostrate in obeisance, save only Iblis, who was of the Jinn, and who revolted against the command of his Lord. What! Will you then take him and his seed as patrons, rather than Me, when they are enemies unto you? Calamitous for the wrong-doers is the exchange,"
I made them not witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of the creation of themselves, nor did I take for My helpers those who lead astray.
(Be mindful) Of the day when He shall say, "Call you upon My pretend partners" and they shall call on them, but they shall not answer them; and We will set the vale of perdition between them; 
And the guilty shall see the Fire, and shall know that they are about to fall therein, and shall find no escape there from. 
Verily, We have displayed in this Quran for men all kinds of similitudes (parables); but man is ever contentious.
Naught prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, or from asking pardon of their Lord, except the coming on them of the judgment of the people of olden days, or the coming of the doom before their own eyes.
We sent not prophets save as heralds of glad tidings and as Warners; but those who disbelieve wrangle with vain speech to make void the truth therewith; and they take My revelations and warnings as a jest.
Who is more unjust than he who, being reminded of the revelations of his Lord, turns away there from, and forgets what his hands have sent forward? Verily, We have placed veils upon their heart lest they should understand, and deafness in their ears! And if you should call them to the guidance, they can never be guided.
But your Lord is Forgiving, endowed with Mercy; were He to punish them for what they have earned He would have hastened for them the doom. Nay rather, they have their appointed term from which they have no escape.
Such were the populations; We destroyed them when they were unjust (iniquitous); and for their destruction We set an appointed time.
And when Moses said to his servant, "I will not cease until I reach the confluence of the two seas, though I go on for years."
But when they reached the confluence of the two they forgot their Fish, and it took its way in the sea with a free course.
And when they had gone further, he said to his servant, "Bring us our breakfast, for we have suffered much fatigue on this journey." 
Said he, "What think you? When we resorted to the rock, then, verily, I forgot the fish, but it was only Satan, who made me forget it, and I forgot to tell you; and it took its way in the sea in a marvellous way."
Moses said, "This is what we were searching for." So they retraced their steps again.
Then they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had given mercy from Ourselves, and had taught him knowledge from Our Presence.
Said Moses to him, "May I follow you, so that you may teach me of the (Higher) Truth which you have been taught?" 
Said he, "Verily, you can never bear it.
How can you be patient about what you can compass no knowledge (you cannot understand)?" 
He said, "Allah willing, you will find me patient; nor will I rebel against your bidding." 
He said, "Well then, if you follow me, ask me not about anything until I myself begin to mention it."
So they set out until when they were in the boat, he made a hole therein and scuttled it. (Moses) Said, "Have you made a hole therein to drown the people therein? You have done a dreadful thing."
Said he, "Did I not tell you, truly, you can never bear with me?"
Moses said (pleaded), "Rebuke me not for forgetting, and be not hard on me." 
So they set out until they met a boy, and he killed him. Moses said, "What! Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed no one? Verily, you have done a foul (evil) deed."
He answered, "Did I not tell you, truly, you can not bear with me?"
Said Moses, "If ever I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company. Now have you received a promise from me." 
So they set out until when they came to the people of a city; and they asked the people thereof for food; but they refused to entertain them. And they found therein a wall which was about to fall into ruins, and he repaired it. Said Moses, "Had you pleased you could certainly have had payment for this."
Said he, "This is the parting between me and you. I will give you the interpretation of that with which you could not bear with me. 
As for the boat, it belonged to poor people, who toiled on the sea (or river), and I wished to damage it, for behind it was a king who seized on every boat by force. 
And as for the youth, his parents were believers, and we feared lest he should oppress them with rebellion and disbelief. 
So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange a better one than him in purity, and nearer in filial affection. 
And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan youths in the city, and beneath it was a treasure belonging to them both, and their father was a righteous man, and their Lord desired that they should reach maturity, and then take out their treasure as a mercy from their Lord; and I did it not on my own command. That is the interpretation of that which you could not bear."
And they will ask you about Zul'qarneyn (The Two-horned one, perhaps an ancient Persian Emperor). Say, "I will recite to you a remembrance of him. 
Verily, We established him firmly in the land, and We gave him a way to everything;
And he followed a way,
Until when he reached the setting of the sun (furthest West), he found it setting in a black muddy spring and he found thereat a people. We said, "O Zul'qarneyn! You have authority either to torment these people, or treat them kindly." 
Said he, "As for him who does wrong, I will punish him, then shall he be sent back to his Lord, and He will punish him with an unheard-of torment; 
But as for him who believes and acts aright, for him is an excellent reward, and we will give him our easy command."
Then he followed another way,
Until when he reached the rising of the sun (furthest East), he found it rising upon a people to whom We had given no shelter there from.
He left them as they were. And We comprehended fully the forces before him.
Then he followed still another way,
Until when he reached the point between the two mountains, he found below them a people who could scarcely under-stand speech. 
They said, "O Zul'qarneyn! Verily, Yagug and Magug (Gog and Magog) are doing great evil in the land. Shall we then pay you tribute, that you set between us and them a barrier?" 
He said, "The power my Lord hath established me in is better than tribute; help me, therefore, with strength (labour), and I will set a barrier between you and them.
"Bring me blocks of iron. When they had filled up the space between the two mountain-sides, he said, "Blow (with your bellows)". When he had made it red with fire, he said, "Bring me, that I may pour over it, molten lead." 
Thus were they made powerless to scale it, and to tunnel through it.
Said he, "This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it as dust, for the promise of my Lord is true."
And on that Day We shall leave them to surge like waves over one another; and the trumpet will be blown, and We will gather them all together.
And We will set forth Hell on that day before the disbelievers,
Whose eyes were veiled from My Remembrance, and who were unable to hear. 
What! Did those who disbelieve reckon that they could take My servants for patrons beside Me? Verily, We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers for their entertainment!
Say, "Shall we inform you of those who lose most by their works? 
Those who erred in their endeavours in the life of this world, and who thought they were acquiring good by their deeds."
They are those who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord and in their meeting Him; vain are their works; and We will not give them any weight on the Day of Judgment. 
That is their reward - Hell! Because that they disbelieved and took My revelations and My Messengers as a jest.
Verily, those who believe and act righteously, for them are Gardens of Paradise 
Wherein they shall dwell, and they shall crave no change there from.
Say, "Were the oceans ink for the Words of my Lord, the ocean would surely fail before the Words of my Lord fail; aye, though We brought as much ink again!
Say, "I am only a mortal like yourselves; I am inspired that your God is only one God. Then let him who hopes to meet his Lord work righteous acts, and join none with Him in the service of his Lord."
KAF HA YA AIN SAD.
A mention of your Lord's mercy to His servant Zachariah, 
When he called on his Lord in secret.
Praying, "My Lord! Verily, my bones are weak, and my head shines with grey hair; but I never was unfortunate in my prayers to Thee, my Lord!
But I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren; then grant me from Thy presence a successor, 
To be my heir (or true representative) and the heir (or true representative) of the family of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, one with whom you are well-pleased."
(The answer came), "O Zachariah! Verily, We give you glad tidings of a son, whose name shall be John. None by that name have We distinguished before."
Said he, "My Lord! How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have become decrepit through old age?"
He said, "Thus it will be. Your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, for I created you at first when yet you were nothing.'"
Said he, "O my Lord! Give me a sign." He said, "Your sign is that you shall not speak to any man for three nights, though you are sound."
Then he went forth unto his people from the chamber, and he made signs to them, "Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night."
(And it was said to his son) " O John! Hold fast the Book", and We gave him Wisdom even as a boy,
And compassion from Our Presence, and purity; and he was devout (pious, righteous),
And kind to his parents, and was not arrogant and rebellious.
So peace upon him the day he was born, and the day he died, and the day he shall be raised up to life again.
And mention Mary in the Book; when she retired from her family into an eastern chamber.
And she took a veil (to screen herself) from them; and We sent unto her Our Angel (or spirit); and he assumed for her the semblance of a perfect man. 
Said she, "Verily, I take refuge in the Merciful One from you, if you are god-fearing." 
Said he, "I am only a messenger of your Lord to bestow on you a pure son."
Said she, "How can I have a boy when no mortal has touched me, and when I am no harlot?" 
He said, "Thus says your Lord, 'It is easy for Me! And We will make him a revelation unto mankind, and a mercy from Us; for it is a thing ordained (or decreed)."
So she conceived him, and she retired with him into a remote place. 
And the labour pains came upon her at the trunk of a palm tree, and she said, "O that I had died before this, and become a thing of naught, forgotten!" 
Then one called to her from beneath her "Grieve not, for your Lord has placed a stream beneath your feet,
And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will drop upon you fresh ripe dates; 
So eat, and drink, and be consoled; and if you should see any mortal say, "Verily, I have vowed to the Beneficent One a fast, and I will not speak to-day to any mortal."
Then she brought him (her son) to her people, carrying it. Said they, "O Mary! You have done an amazing (abominable) thing!
"O sister of Aaron! Your father was not a bad man, nor was your mother a harlot!"
Then she pointed to him, and they said, "How are we to speak with one who is a baby in the cradle?" 
He (the baby) said, "Verily, I am a servant of Allah; He has brought me the Book (revelation), and He has made me a prophet,
"And He has made me blessed wherever I am; and He has required of me prayer and charity as long as I live, 
And has made me kind towards my mother, and not arrogant (tyrannical) and miserable; 
And peace upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised up alive."
Such was Jesus, the son of Mary. This is the statement of truth concerning which they doubt (or dispute).
It befits not the Majesty of Allah that he should beget a son. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a matter He only says to it, "BE," and it is.
And, lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord (see John 20:17), so worship Him; this is the Straight Way.
And the sects among them disagree, but woe to those who disbelieve from the meeting of the mighty Day.
How plainly will they see and hear on the day when they shall come to Us; but today the evildoers are in manifest error!
And warn them of the Day of Sighs (Anguish, Regret, Distress) when the matter is determined. Now they are heedless, and believe not.
Verily, We will inherit the earth and all who are upon it, and unto Us shall they return!
And mention Abraham in the Book; verily, he was a saint (a man of truth, a true witness), a prophet. 
When he said to his father, "O my sire! Why do you worship what can neither hear nor see nor avail you aught? 
"O my Sire! Verily, to me has come knowledge which has not come to you; so follow me, and I will guide you to a Straight and Level Way.
"O my Sire! Serve not Satan; verily, Satan is ever a rebel against the Beneficent One. 
"O my Sire! Verily, I fear that there may afflict you punishment from the Beneficent One, and that you may be a comrade (or client) of Satan."
Said he, "What! Do you reject (or hate) my gods, O Abraham? Verily, if you do not desist I will certainly stone you; but get you gone from me for a long time!"
Said he, "Peace be upon you! I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Verily, He is to me most gracious.
"I will part from you and what you call on beside Allah, and will pray unto my Lord. It may be that in my prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be unblest."
And when he had parted from them and what they served beside Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and each of them We made a prophet.
And We bestowed on them of Our Mercy, and We granted them lofty honour on (or from) the tongue of truth.
And mention Moses in the Book; verily, he was chosen, and was a Messenger, a prophet.
We called him from the right side of the Mount (Sinai); and We made him draw nigh unto Us to commune with him, 
And We granted him out of Our Mercy, his brother Aaron also a prophet.
And mention Ishmael in the Book; verily, he was true to his promise, and was a messenger and a prophet.
He used to enjoin on his people prayers and charity, and was most acceptable (sacrifice) in the sight of his Lord.
And mention, in the Book, Idris (Enoch?); verily, he was a saint and a prophet;
And We raised him to a lofty place.
These are those to whom Allah has been gracious, of the prophets of the seed of Adam, and of those whom We carried with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and of those We guided and elected. When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fall down adoring and weeping.
But there succeeded after them a later generation who have ruined worship and have followed lusts (prejudices, fantasies, greed, self-interest, superstition), but they shall at length face deception (or failure, destruction),
Save such as repent and believe and act right; for these shall enter the Garden and shall not be wronged in aught,
Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent has promised to His servants in the Unseen; verily, His promise ever comes to pass!
They shall hear no empty (vain) talk therein, but only Peace; and there they shall have their provision morning and evening;
Such is the Garden which We will give for an inheritance to those of our servants who are devout.
(The angels say), "We descend not save at the command of your Lord; His is what is before us, and what is behind us, and what is between these; for your Lord is never forgetful -
"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and of what is between the two; so serve (worship) Him and persevere in His service. Do you know of any worthy of His Name?
Man will say, "What! When I have died shall I then come forth alive?" 
But then does not man remember that We created him before when he was naught?
And by your Lord! We will, without doubt, gather them together, and the devils (or evil ones) too; then will We surely bring them forth on their knees round about Hell.
Then shall We certainly drag, out from every sect, whichever of them has been most obstinately rebellious against the Beneficent.
And surely We are best aware of those who are most deserving to be broiled therein.
There is not one of you who will not go down to it (the Fire), that is a fixed Decree of your Lord.
Then We will save those who fear Us; but We will leave the evildoers therein on their knees.
And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Which of the two parties (your s or mine) is best placed and in the best company?"
And how many generations before them have We destroyed who were better off in property and outward appearance?
Say, "Whoever is in error, the Beneficent will extend to him until they see what they are threatened with, whether it be the torment in this world or whether it be the Hour (of Doom in the Hereafter), then they shall know who is worse placed and weakest in forces!"
And those who seek guidance, Allah will increase their guidance. And enduring good works are best with your Lord for a reward, and best for restoration (or eventual returns).
Have you seen him who disbelieves in Our signs, and says, "I shall surely be given wealth and children?"
Has he become acquainted with the Unseen, or has he made a pact with the Beneficent? 
Not so! We will write down what he says, and We will extend for him a span of torment,
And We will make him inherit that whereof he spoke, and he shall come to Us alone.
They take other gods besides Allah to be their source of power.
Not so! They shall deny their worship of them, and shall become their opponents!
Do you not see that We have sent the devils against the disbelievers, to confound them with confusion.
So be not you hasty with them. Verily, We do but number them a sum (of days).
On the Day when We will gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, honoured as a goodly company,
We will drive the guilty into hell, like thirsty herds to water.
They shall have no power of intercession, save him who has taken a covenant with his Lord.
They say, "The Beneficent has taken to Himself a son."
Assuredly, you have brought a monstrous thing! 
Whereby the heavens are almost torn asunder, and the earth is riven, and the mountains fall in ruin.
That you attribute to the Beneficent a son, 
When it is not becoming to the majesty of the Beneficent that he take to Himself a son.
There is none in the heavens or the earth but comes to the Beneficent as a servant.
Verily, He knows them and numbers them exactly.
And each one of them come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone
Verily, those who believe and act aright, on them the Beneficent bestows love.
We have made the Scripture easy on your tongue, only that you may thereby give glad tidings unto those who ward of evil, and warn thereby a contentious people.
How many a generation before them have We destroyed? Can you find any one of them, or hear a whisper of them?
TA HA. 
We have not sent down this Quran to you that you should be distressed;
But only as a reminder to him who fears (or is in awe of Allah or fears doing wrong),
Descending (as a revelation) from Him who created the earth and the high heavens,
The most Beneficent is firmly settled on the Throne (of Authority).
To Him belongs what is in the heavens, and what is in the earth, and all that which is between the two, and all that which is beneath the ground!
And if you pronounce the words loudly (or publicly), yet, verily, he knows the secret and the even more hidden.
Allah! There is no God but He! To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names.
Has the story of Moses come to you? 
Behold, he saw a fire: and said to his folk, "Tarry ye; verily, I perceive a fire far off. Perhaps I may bring you there from a brand, or may find some guidance (news, information) by the fire."
And when he came to it he was addressed, "O Moses!
Verily, I am your Lord, so take off your sandals; verily, you are in the holy valley Tuwa,
And I have chosen you. So listen to what is inspired in you; 
"Verily, I am Allah; there is no God but Me! So serve Me, and be steadfast in prayer to remember Me.
"Verily, the hour is coming, but I will to keep it hidden (but make it known), that every soul may be recompensed for its efforts.
"Let not then him who believes not therein and follows his lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions) ever turn you away there from, lest you be ruined.
"What is that in your right hand, O Moses?"
Said he, "It is my staff on which I lean, and wherewith I beat down leaves for my flocks, and for which I have other uses."
Allah said, "Throw it down, O Moses!" 
And he threw it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving (alive).
He said, "Take hold of it and fear not; We will restore it to its former state.
"But press your hand to your side, it shall come forth white without harm, as another sign.
To show you of Our greater signs.
"Go unto Pharaoh. Verily, he is outrageous (he has transgressed beyond bounds)"
Said he, "My Lord! Expand for me my breast (relieve my mind from tension); 
"And ease my task for me;
And loosen the knot from my tongue, 
"That they may understand my saying.
"Appoint for me a minister from my people,
"Aaron, my brother; 
"Gird up my loins through him, 
"And let him share my task,
"That we may glorify Thee much,
"And much remember Thee.
"Verily, Thou art He who is ever Seeing of us!"
He said, "You are granted your request, O Moses.
"And We have already shown favours unto you at another time.
"When We inspired your mother with the message,
"'Put him into the ark, and put it into the river. The river shall cast him on the shore, and an enemy of Mine and of his shall take him.' And on you have I cast love from Me, that you may be trained according to My will.
When your sister walked on and said, "Shall I guide you to one who will nurse him? And We restored you to your mother, that her eye might be cheered and that she should not grieve. And you did slay a man and We saved you from the resulting trouble, and We tried you with various trials. And you did tarry for years amongst the people of Midian; then you did come hither as ordained, O Moses.
"And I have prepared you for Myself.
"Go, you and your brother, with my Signs (revelations), and be not remiss in remembering Me. 
"Go you both to Pharaoh. Verily, he is outrageous (transgresses beyond bounds).
And speak to him a gentle speech, that per chance (or possibly) he may be mindful or fear."
They two said, "Our Lord! Verily, we fear that he may be beforehand with us (hasty in arrogance before we can accomplish our mission), or that he may be outrageous (transgressing all bounds or tyrannous)."
He said, "Fear not. Verily, I am with you twain, Hearing and Seeing.
"So go you to him and say, 'Verily, we are the messengers of your Lord; Let the children of Israel go with us, and torment them not. We bring you a sign from your Lord, and peace will be upon him who follows the right guidance.
"'Verily, it has been revealed unto us that the torment will surely come upon him who denies us and turns away.'"
Pharaoh said, "And who is your Lord, O Moses?"
He said, "Our Lord is He who gave everything its form, nature and existence, then guided it right."
Said he (Pharaoh), "And what of the former generations?"
He said, "The knowledge of them is with my Lord in a Book (or Record); my Lord neither errs nor forgets.
"Who made for you the earth a bed; and has traced for you paths therein; and has sent down from the sky water." We have brought forth thereby divers classes of vegetation. 
Eat and pasture your cattle there from. Verily, in this are signs to those endowed with intelligence (minds or understanding). 
From it have We created you and into it will We return you, and from it will We bring you forth again."
We did show him Our signs, all of them, but he called them lies and refused.
Said he, "Have you come to us, to turn us out of our land with your magic, O Moses? 
"Then we will bring you magic like it; and we will make between us and you an appointment which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor you - at a fair place (convenient to both or one where both have an equal chance)."
Moses said, "Let your appointment be for the day of the festival, and let the people assemble when the sun is high (noon)."
Then Pharaoh gathered his strength (being disconcerted), and returned (having formed a plot).
Said Moses to him, "Woe to you! Forge you not against Allah a lie; lest He destroy you by punishment. The forger must ever suffer disappointment (or failure)."
And they argued the matter among themselves, but they kept their counsel secret.
Said they, "These two are certainly two expert magicians, who wish to turn you out of (authority in) the land by their magic, and to remove your most cherished (or exemplary) traditions (doctrines, institutions). 
Collect, therefore, your tricks (or lay your plans), and then form a row (or battle line); for he who has the upper-hand this day will be successful indeed."
Said they, "O Moses! Either you must throw first, or let us throw first."
He said, "Nay, you throw first!" And lo! Their ropes and their staves appeared to move along. 
And Moses felt a secret fear within his soul.
Said We, "Fear not! You shall have the upper hand. 
"Throw what is in your right hand; and it shall devour what they have made. Verily, that which they have made is but a magician's trick; and no magician shall prosper whatever skill he has."
And then the magicians were cast down in prostration (obeisance), saying, "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and of Moses!"
Said he (Pharaoh), "Do you believe in Him before I give you leave? Verily, he is your master who taught you magic! Therefore will I surely cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of palm trees; and you shall surely know which of us can give the keenest of torment and the more lasting."
Said they, "We will never prefer you to what has come to us as Manifest Signs, and to Him who originated us. Decree then whatever you desire to decree; for you can only decree about the life of this world!
Verily, we believe in our Lord. May He pardon us our sins, and the magic you have forced us to use; and Allah is better and more lasting!"
Verily, he who comes to his Lord guilty, verily, for him is hell; he shall therein neither die nor live.
But he who comes to Him a believer who has done right, for them are the highest ranks, 
Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever. That is the reward for him who grows (or purifies himself).
And We inspired Moses, saying, "Journey by night with my servants, and strike out for them a dry road in the sea. Fear not pursuit, nor be afraid!" 
Then Pharaoh followed them with his armies, and the sea overwhelmed them and covered them up completely.
Pharaoh had led his people astray instead of guiding them right.
O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy; and We made a covenant with you on the side of the mount; and We sent down upon you the manna and the quails.
Saying, "Eat of the good things We have provided you with, but do not commit excesses therein, lest My wrath justly descend upon you; for on whomsoever My wrath descends they perish indeed.
"Yet am I also He who forgives unto him who repents and believes and does right, and then is guided.
"But what has hastened you on away from your people, O Moses?"
Moses said, "They are here close behind, and I hastened to Thee, my Lord, to please Thee."
Said He, "Verily, We have tested your people in your absence, and As-Samiri has led them astray."
And Moses returned to his people, wrathful, grieving! Said he, "O my people! Did not your Lord make you a goodly promise? Has the time seemed too long for you, or do you desire that wrath should descend on you from your Lord, and so you have broken your promise to me?"
They said, "We have not broken our promise to you of our own accord. But we were made to carry the load of the ornaments of the people, and we hurled them (into the fire). That was what As-Samiri bid us.
Then he brought forth for the people (out of the fire) a corporeal (a statue of a) calf. It seemed to low, and they said, "This is your god and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten!"
What! Do they not see that it does not answer them in speech, and cannot control for them harm or profit?
Aaron had already, before this, said to them, "O my people! You are only being tried (or seduced) thereby; and, verily, your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my bidding."
They said, "We will not cease to pay devotion to it until Moses return to us."
Said he (Moses), "O Aaron! What prevented you, when you did see them go astray,
From following me? Have you then rebelled against my bidding?
Said he, "O son of my mother! Seize me not by my beard, or my head! Verily, I feared lest you should say, 'You have made a division amongst the children of Israel, and have not waited for my word.'"
(Moses) said, "What was your design, O Samiri?" 
Said he, "I beheld what they beheld not, and I grasped a handful of dust from the footprint of the messenger and cast it; for thus my soul induced me."
Said he, "Then get you gone; verily, it shall be yours in life to say, "Touch me not!" and, verily, for you there is a tryst which you shall surely never break. But look at your god to which you were just now a devout worshipper. We will surely burn it, and scatter it in pieces over the sea.
"Your God is only Allah besides Whom there is no other God. He embraces all things in His knowledge."
Thus do We narrate to you the history of what has gone before, and We have brought you from Our Presence a reminder.
Whoever turns there from, verily, he shall bear a great burden on the Day of Resurrection.
Abiding under it, an evil burden to bear on the Day of Resurrection.
On the day when the Trumpet shall be blown, and We will gather the guilty on that day white-eyed (with terror).
They shall whisper to each other, "You have only tarried ten days."
We know best what they say, when their leaders, best in conduct say, "You have only tarried a day."
They will ask you about the mountains; say, "My Lord will break them into scattered dust, 
"And He will leave them a level plain,
"Wherein you will see no curve or ruggedness (crookedness or unevenness)."
On that day they shall follow the Caller who deceives not; and the voices shall be hushed before the Beneficent, and you shall hear naught but a shuffling (or tramp of marching feet).
On that day shall no intercession be of any avail, save from such as the Beneficent permits, and who is acceptable to Him.
He knows what is before them and what is behind them, but they comprehend not His knowledge.
All faces shall be humbled before the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal; Hopeless will be indeed the man that carries iniquity on his back.
But he who does righteous acts and has faith, he shall fear neither wrong nor diminution.
Thus have We revealed it in an Arabic Lecture (Quran); and have displayed in it certain threats, that per chance (or possibly) they may fear evil, or it may cause them to take heed.
Exalted then be Allah, the King, the Truth (or the True King)! Hasten not the Quran before its inspiration is completed for you; but say, "O Lord! increase me in knowledge."
We did make a covenant with Adam of yore, but he forgot it, and We found no firm purpose in him.
And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they prostrated themselves, save Iblis, who refused. 
And We said, "O Adam! Verily, this is a foe to you and to your wife; never then let him drive you twain forth from the garden or you will be wretched. 
Verily, you have not to be hungry there, nor naked.
And, verily, you shall not thirst therein, nor suffer from the sun's heat!"
But Satan whispered to him, saying. "O Adam! shall I guide you to the Tree of Immortality, and a kingdom that wastes not away?"
And they ate there from, and their shame became apparent to them; and they began to stitch upon themselves some leaves of the garden; and Adam rebelled against his Lord, and went astray.
Then his Lord chose him, and relented towards him, and guided him.
Said he, "Go down, you twain, there from altogether, some of you foes to the other. And if there should come to you from Me a guidance; then whoever follows My guidance shall neither err nor come to grief.
But he who turns away from Remembrance of Me, verily, for him shall be a narrow life; and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection."
He shall say, "My Lord! Wherefore have you gathered me blind when I used to see?"
He shall say, "Our revelations came to you, and you did forget them; In like manner are you forgotten this Day!"
Thus do We recompense him who is extravagant and believes not in the revelations of his Lord; and the doom of the hereafter is keener and more lasting!
Is it not guidance for them to know how many generations We have destroyed before them, amidst whose dwelling-places they walk? Verily, in that are signs to men of thought (or intelligence).
But for the decree already passed from your Lord, and a term already fixed, the judgment would have come to them now.
Therefore, bear patiently with what they say, and celebrate the praises of your Lord ere the rising of the sun, and ere its setting, and glorify Him at times in the night and at the two ends of the day, that you may find acceptance.
And do not strain after what We have provided a few of them - the splendours of the life of this world, through which We test them; but the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting.
Bid your people worship, and persevere in it; We do not ask you to provide, it is We Who will provide for you. But the sequel is for righteousness.
They say, "Unless he brings us a sign from his Lord.....". What! Has there not come to them the proof of what was in the former scriptures?
But had We destroyed them with doom before it, they would have said, "If only Thou had sent to us a messenger, that we might follow Thy signs before we were abased and put to shame."
Say, "Each one has to wait, so wait you also! But in the end you shall know who it is that is on the straight and level path, and who it is that is guided right."
Their reckoning draws nigh to men, yet in heedlessness they turn aside.
No new reminder comes to them from their Lord, but they listen to it as in (or while they play (or as a jest), 
Their heart trifling with it (or pre-occupied elsewhere). And those who do wrong discourse secretly, saying, "Is this man aught but a mortal like yourselves? Will you succumb to magic with open eyes?"
Say, "My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the earth, He is Hearer and Knower."
"Nay!" they say, "Muddled dreams; nay! He has forged it; nay! He is a poet; but let him bring us a sign as those of yore were sent."
Of those before them not one of the communities which We destroyed believed, how will these believe? 
Nor did We send before them any but men whom We inspired? Ask you the people of the Scriptures if you do not know. 
Nor did We give them bodies that ate no food, nor were they immortal. 
Yet We made Our promise to them good, and We saved them and whom We pleased; but We destroyed those who committed excesses.
Now have We sent down to you a Book in which is a reminder for you; have you then no sense?
How many a community that had done wrong have We shattered, and raised up after it another people! 
And when they perceived Our Might, behold, they tried to flee from it. 
"Flee not away, but return to what you delighted in, and to your dwellings, that you may be questioned."
Said they, "O woe is us! Verily, we were wrong-doers."
And that ceased not to be their cry until We made them like mown down fields, extinct (or as smouldering ashes).
We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between the two in play.
Had We wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in (or nearer) Our Presence, if We would do such a thing.
Nay, We hurl the True against the False and it does break its head, and lo! It vanishes. But woe to you for what you attribute (to Allah).
Unto Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth, and those who dwell in His Presence are not too proud to serve Him, nor do they weary. 
They glorify Him by night and day without intermission. 
Or have they chosen gods from the earth who can raise the dead?
Were there in both (heaven and earth) gods beside Allah, both would surely have been disordered. Glorified is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, above all they ascribe unto Him.
He can not be questioned concerning what He does, but They shall be questioned.
Have they chosen gods beside Him? Say, "Bring your proofs. This is the reminder (Message) of those who are with me (Muhammad), and of those who were before me." Nay, most of them know not the truth, so they turn away.
We have not sent any messenger before you, but We inspired him that, "There is no god but Me, so serve you Me."
And they say, "The Beneficent has taken a son; glorified be He! Nay, but they are honoured servants; 
They speak not until He speaks; and they act by His command (John30).
He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they can not intercede except for him whom He accepts; and they shrink through awe of Him.
And whoever of them should say, "Verily, I am God instead of (or besides) Him," such a one We recompense with hell; thus do We repay the wrong-doers.
Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, and We parted them; and We made every living thing from water. Will they then not believe?
And We placed on the earth firm mountains lest it should move with them, and He made therein open roads for paths, per chance (or possibly) they may be guided.
And We made the heaven a guarded canopy; yet from our signs they turn aside!
He it is who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, they float each in their orbit.
We appointed immortality for no mortal before you. What! If you die, will they live on forever? 
Every soul must taste of death. We will test you with evil and with good, as a trial; and unto Us will you be returned.
And when those who disbelieve see you, they only take you for a jest, saying, "Is this he who mentions your gods?" Yet they blaspheme at the mention of the Beneficent.
Man is made of haste. I will show you My signs; but do not ask Me to hasten.
And they say, "When will this threat (come to pass), if you tell the truth?"
If those who disbelieve but knew the time when they will not be able to ward off the Fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped! 
Nay, it shall come on them unawares, and shall dumbfound them, and they shall not be able to repel it, nor shall they be reprieved.
Prophets before you have been mocked at, but that whereat they jested encompassed those who mocked.
Say, "Who guards you by night and by day from the Beneficent?" Nay, but they turn away from the mention of their Lord.
Have they gods to defend them against Us? These cannot help themselves, nor can they be defended against Us.
Nay, but We have granted enjoyment to these men and to their fathers until the period grew long for them. Do they not see that We come to the land and shorten its borders? Shall they then prevail?
Say, "I only warn you by inspiration;" but the deaf hear not the call when they are warned. 
But if a breath of the Wrath of your Lord touches them, they will surely say, "O, woe is us! Verily, we were wrong-doers!"
We will place a just balance on the Day of Resurrection, and no soul shall be wronged in anything. Even though it is the weight of a grain of mustard seed, We will bring it; for We are sufficient as a reckoner.
In the past We did give to Moses and Aaron the Criterion (or Discrimination), and a Light and a Reminder to those who fear (evil); 
Those who fear their Lord in secret (in thought), and who dread the Hour (of Judgment).
This is a blessed Reminder which We have sent down (or revealed), will you then reject it?
And We gave Abraham of old his Rectitude of conduct (or proper course, as distinct from Faith); for We were aware of him (his faith).
When he said to his father and to his people, "What are these images to which you pay devotion?" 
Said they, "We found our fathers worshipping them." 
Said he, "Verily, both you and your fathers have been in obvious error." 
They said, "Do you come to us with the truth, or are you but of those who jest?"
He said, "Nay, but your Lord is Lord of the heavens and the earth, which He originated (created from nothing); and I am of those who testify unto this; 
And, by Allah! I have a plan for your idols after you have gone and turned your backs!"
So he broke them in pieces, all except their largest, that they might have recourse to it.
Said they, "Who has done this to our gods? Surely, he is of the evil-doers!" 
Others said, "We heard a youth mention them, he is called Abraham."
Said they, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness."
Said they, "Was it you who did this to our gods, O Abraham?" 
Said he, "Nay, it was this largest of the idols. But ask them, if they can speak."
Then they turned to themselves and said, "Surely, you are the ones in the wrong." 
Then were they confounded with shame and said, "You knew well that these cannot speak."
Said he, "Will you then worship, beside Allah, that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you? 
"Fie upon you, and what you serve beside Allah! Have you then no sense?"
They cried, "Burn him, and stand by your gods, if you are going to do anything."
We said, "O fire! Be you cool and a safety for Abraham!"
They desired to set a snare for him, but We made them the losers.
And We brought him and Lot safely to the land (Aram or Syria) which We have blessed for all nations (or peoples),
And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and as an additional gift (a grandson), Jacob and each of them We made righteous. 
And We made them Leaders to guide men by Our command, and We sent inspiration to them to do good works, and to be steadfast in prayer, and to practice charity; and they were constant in their service of Us alone.
And Lot, to him We gave judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him safely from the community which practiced abominations; truly, they were a people given to evil lewdness. 
And We brought him into Our Mercy; verily, he was of the righteous.
And Noah, of old times, when he called We answered him and saved him and his people from the great affliction,
And We helped him against the people who said Our signs were lies; verily, they were a bad people, therefore did We drown them all.
And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field, when some people's sheep had strayed therein at night; and We were witness to their judgment;
And We gave Solomon right understanding of matters (or cases). To each of them We gave judgment and knowledge; and it was by Our power that the hills and the birds celebrate Our praises with David. It was We who did it.
And We taught him the art of making coats of mail for you, to shield you from each other's violence; are you then grateful?
And to Solomon We subjected the violent wind, to flow tamely at his bidding to the land which We have blessed - for We are aware of all things.
And some devils (evil ones), who dived for him, and did other works beside, it was We who kept guard over them.
And Job, when he cried to his Lord, saying, "Lo! Adversity has touched me, but you are the most Merciful of the merciful ones." 
And We answered him, and removed from him the distress that was upon him; and We restored to him his people, and doubled their number as a mercy from Us, and as a remembrance to those who serve Us.
And (remember) Ishmael, and Idris (Enoch?), and Zul-Kifl (Ezekiel?), all men of constancy and patient: 
And We admitted them into Our Mercy; verily, they were among the righteous.
And remember Zun-nun (the man of the Whale, Jonah), when he went away in wrath and thought that We had no power over him; but he cried out in the darkness, "There is no God but Thou, celebrated be Thy praise! Verily, I was of the wrong!" 
And We answered him, and saved him from the distress. Thus do We deliver those who have faith.
And (remember) Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord, "O Lord! Leave me not without off-spring, though you are the best of inheritors." 
And We answered him, and bestowed upon him Yahya (John); and We made his wife right for him (cured her barrenness). Verily, they used to vie with one another in good works, and they called unto Us with longing and awe, and were humble (or submissive) before Us.
And (remember) her who guarded her chastity, and We breathed into her of Our Spirit, and We made her and her son a sign unto the worlds (or all peoples, or all creatures).
Verily, this your religion (or brotherhood) is a single religion (brotherhood); and I am your Lord, so serve Me.
But they cut up their affairs (religion, politics etc. into fragments) amongst themselves, yet they all shall return unto Us; 
And he who acts right and he who is a believer (or has faith), there is no denial of his efforts, for, verily, We record it for him.
There is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed that they shall not return,
Until Yagug and Magug (Gog and Magog, Lawless tribes or Lawlessness itself) are let loose (through every barrier), and they hasten out of every mound (rock, nook and cranny).
And the True Promise draws nigh, and lo! They are staring, wide-eyed are those who disbelieve, saying, "O, woe is us! We were heedless of this, aye, we were wrong-doers!"
Verily, ye, and what you serve beside Allah, shall be the fuel of hell. Thereto shall you go down!
Had these been gods, they would not have come hither, but all shall dwell therein.
For them therein is groaning, and they shall not be heard.
Verily, those for whom the Good from Us has gone before, they will be removed far there from;
They shall not hear the slightest sound of Hell, and they will dwell in what their souls desire. 
The Great Terror shall not grieve them; but the angels shall greet them, saying, "This is your day, the one which you were promised!"
The Day when We will roll up the heavens as a recorder rolls up the scroll. As We produced it at its first creation, We shall repeat it - a promise binding upon Us; verily, We shall do it. 
And already have We written in the Psalms after the Reminder (the Message of Moses) that "My righteous servants shall inherit the earth."
Verily, in this is a plain statement for a people who serve Me.
We have sent you not, but as a mercy to the worlds.
Say, "I am only inspired that your God is one God; will ye, then, surrender unto Him (become Muslims)?" 
But if they turn their backs, then say, "I have proclaimed the message to you all alike, though I know not if what you are promised be near or far."
"Verily, He knows what is spoken openly, and that which you hide.
"I know not but that this may be a trial for you, and provision for a season."
Say, "O My Lord! Judge you with truth! Our Lord is the Beneficent Whose aid is to be sought against the blasphemies you utter."
O mankind! Fear your Lord. Verily, the convulsions of the Hour (of Judgment) will be a thing terrible.
On the day you shall see it, every suckling woman shall be scared away from that to which she gave suck; and every pregnant woman shall drop her load unformed; and you shall see men in drunken riot, though not drunk: but dreadful will be the wrath of Allah.
And yet amongst men are such who wrangles about Allah without knowledge, and follows every rebellious devil; 
Against whom it is written down that whoever turns to him for friendship, verily, He will lead him astray, and will guide him towards the penalty of the blaze!
O Mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, consider that We created you from earth, then from a seed, then from a clot, then from a little lump of flesh, shaped or shapeless, that We may explain to you. And We make what We please to remain in the womb for an appointed time; then We bring you forth as babes; then give you growth that you reach your age of full strength; and some of you are called to die early; and some of you are kept back till the most decrepit age, so that he no longer knows aught of the knowledge he had. And you see the earth parched, and when We send down water on it, it stirs and swells, and brings forth growth of every beautiful pair.
That is because Allah, He is the Truth. Lo! He quickens the dead, and lo! He is Able to do all things.
And because the Hour will come; there is no doubt thereof; and because Allah will raise those who are in the graves.
And yet amongst men are those who wrangles about Allah without knowledge, without guidance, and without a Book of Enlightenment;
Turning his neck from the way of Allah; for him is disgrace in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection We will make him taste the doom of burning.
This is for what your two hands have sent before you, and in this Allah is not an oppressor unto His servants.
And amongst men are those who serve Allah wavering on a brink; so that if there befall him good, he is comforted; but if there befall him a trial, he falls away. He loses both this world and the Hereafter - that is an obvious loss. 
He calls, besides Allah, on what can neither harm him nor profit him - that is a wide error.
He calls on him whose harm is nearer than his benefit - verily, an evil patron and an evil comrade.
Verily, Allah makes those who believe and do aright enter into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; verily, Allah does what He intends.
He who thinks that Allah will not help him (Muhammad) in this world or in the Hereafter, let him stretch a rope to the ceiling (or heaven) and put an end to himself; and then let him see if his plan will remove that which enrages him.
Thus have We sent down Manifest Signs; for, verily, Allah guides whom He will.
Verily, those who believe this Revelation, and those who are Jews, and the Sabaeans, and the Christians, and the Magians, and those who join other gods with Allah, verily, Allah will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection; verily, Allah is witness over all things.
Do you not see that unto Allah bow down in worship (or submit in service and adoration) whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the beasts, and many among mankind, though there are many unto whom the doom is justly due? Whomsoever Allah abases there is none to honour him; verily, Allah does what He will.
These twain are two opponents who dispute about their Lord. But those who disbelieve, garments (or coverings) of fire will be cut out for them, and on their heads boiling water will be poured down,
Whereby that which is in their bellies and their skins shall be scalded.
And for them are hooks of iron. 
Whenever they desire to come forth there from through pain, they will be sent back into it: and (it is said unto them) "Taste you the penalty of the burning!"
Verily, Allah will make those who believe and do right enter into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; they shall be bedecked therein with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their garments therein shall be of silk,
For they are guided to goodly speech, and they shall be guided to the path of Him who is worthy of all praise (the All-laudable or Glorious One).
Verily, those who disbelieve and bar men from Allah's path and from the Sacred Place of Worship, which We have appointed for all mankind alike, the dweller therein and the stranger - and he who desires therein profanity or injustice, We will make him taste a grievous woe.
And when We prepared the site (in Mecca) for Abraham as the place of the Holy House, saying, "Associate naught with Me, but cleanse My House for those who make the rounds, for those who stand to pray, for those who bow, and for those too who prostrate themselves.
"And proclaim amongst men the Pilgrimage; they will come to you on foot and on every kind of camel, lean from journeys through distant mountain and deep ravines,
That they may witness things of benefit for them, and that they may mention the name of Allah for (or on) appointed days over the cattle Allah has provided them with (for sacrifice), then eat thereof and feed the distressed ones in want.
Then let them make an end of their self-neglect, and let them pay their vows and go around the ancient House.
That do. And whoever magnifies the sacred things of Allah it is better for him with his Lord. Cattle are lawful for you, except that which has been recited to you. So shun the abomination of idols, and shun lying speech.
Turning unto Allah only, not associating aught with Him; for he who associates aught with Allah, it is as though he had fallen from heaven, and the birds snatch him up, or the wind blows him away into a far distant place.
That is his State. And he who honours the Symbols of Allah (and sacrificial animals), they come (or ought to come) from the piety of heart.
Therein have you benefits for an appointed term. In the end the place for sacrificing them is near the Ancient House (Mina near the Kaaba).
To every nation have We appointed rites, that they may mention the name of Allah over the sustenance He has provided them from animals fit for food; and your God is one God; to Him then surrender, and give glad tidings to the humble,
To those whose heart, when Allah is mentioned, are filled with awe, and to those who endure patiently all that befalls them, and to those who are steadfast in prayer and who spend of what We have given them.
The camels! We have appointed them for you as one of the symbols of Allah. Therein have you much good; so mention the name of Allah over them as they stand in a row, and when they are down (dead after slaughter) eat of them, and feed the easily contented (the poor that beg not) and him who begs with humility. Thus have We subjected them to you; per chance (or possibly), you may give thanks.
Their meat will never reach to Allah, nor yet their blood, but the piety from you will reach Him. Thus hath He subjected them to you that you may magnify Allah for guiding you: and give you glad tidings to those who do right.
Verily, Allah will defend those who are true; verily, Allah loves not any treacherous ingrate (or traitor and ingrate).
Permission is given to those who fight because they have been wronged, and, indeed, Allah has power to give them victory;
Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said, "Our Lord is Allah;" - for were it not for Allah repelling some men by means of others, cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is mentioned much, would assuredly have been destroyed. But Allah will surely help him who helps Him - verily, Allah is Powerful, Almighty -
Those who, if We establish them in the land, are steadfast in prayer, and give regular charity, and bid what is right, and forbid what is wrong - with Allah rests the end (final outcome) of affairs.
But if they call you liar, even so did the people of Noah, and the tribes of A'ad and Thamud, they denied (My messengers) before you. 
And the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot, 
And the dweller of Midian; and Moses was called a liar too: but I indulged the disbelievers a long while, and then I seized them, and how terrible was My rejection!
And how many a city (community) have We destroyed while it was guilty (did wrong), and it tumbled down on its roof, lying ruined to this day, and how many a deserted well and lofty palace!
Have they not travelled through the land? And have they not heart wherewith to feel (understand), and ears wherewith to hear? For, indeed, it is not their eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts which are within their breasts that grow blind.
They will bid you to hasten on the torment, but Allah will never fail in his promise; for, verily, a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you number.
And to how many a city have I given full range while it yet did wrong! Then I seized it, and unto Me was the return.
Say, "O mankind! I am naught but a plain Warner to you, 
"And to those who believe and do right, for them is forgiveness and a generous provision;
But those who strive to discredit Our signs, they are rightful owners of the Fire."
We have not sent before you any messenger or prophet, but that when he formed a desire (or recited the message), Satan introduced not something (evil or vain) into it; but Allah annuls what Satan proposes; then does Allah confirm (establish) His Signs (revelations) and Allah is Knower, Wise.
That He may make that which Satan introduces a trial unto those in whose heart is a disease, and those whose heart are hardened - verily, the wrongdoers are in a wide schism -
And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord, and may believe therein, and that their heart may surrender humbly unto Him. Verily, Allah surely will guide those who believe into the Straight Way.
But those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the Hour (of Judgment) comes on them suddenly, or there comes on them the torment of the Day of Disaster.
The dominion (or sovereignty) on that day shall be Allah's, He shall judge between them; and those who believe and do aright shall be in Gardens of Delight,
But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelation, for them is a shameful doom.
And those who flee their homes in the cause of Allah, and then are slain or die, Allah will surely provide them with a goodly provision; for, verily, Allah is the best of providers.
Assuredly, He shall make them enter by an entrance that they will love. For, verily, Allah is Knower, Most-forbearing.
That is so. Whoever retaliates with the like of what He has been made to suffer, and shall then be wronged again, Allah shall surely succour him; verily, Allah blots out sins and is constantly Forgiving.
That is because Allah causes the night to pass into day, and causes the day to pass into night, and because Allah is Hearer, Seer.
That is because Allah, He is the Truth (or Reality), and that whereon they call instead of Him is the False, and because Allah, He is the High, the Great.
See you not how Allah sends down water from the sky, and on the morrow the earth is green? Verily, Allah is Subtile, Aware.
Unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth; verily, Allah is the Absolute, the Owner of all Praise.
Have you not seen that Allah has subjected for you all that is in the earth, and the ship that runs on in the sea at His bidding, and He holds back the sky from falling on the earth save at His bidding? Verily, Allah to mankind is Gracious, Merciful.
He it is who quickens you, then makes you die, then will He quicken you again; verily, man is indeed ungrateful. 
Unto every nation have We given sacred rites which they are to perform; so let them not then dispute about the matter, but summon you unto your Lord; verily, you (Muhammad) indeed follow right guidance.
But if they wrangle with you, say, "Allah best knows what you do.
"Allah shall judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein you differ.
"Did you not know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth? Verily, it is in a Record; verily, it is easy for Allah."
And they serve beside Allah that for which He has sent down (revealed) no warrant, and that whereof they have no knowledge. For wrongdoers there is no helper.
When Our clear revelations are read to them, you may recognize disdain in the faces of those who disbelieve; they well-nigh attack those who recite Our revelations to them. Say, "Shall I inform you of something worse than that for you? The Fire which Allah has promised to those who disbelieve; an evil journey end!"
O mankind! A similitude is coined for you, so pay heed to it. Verily, those on whom you call beside Allah could never create a fly even if they combine together to do it. And if the fly should snatch something from them they could not rescue it from it. So weak are both the seeker and the sought.
They do not value Allah at His true value; verily, Allah is Powerful, Mighty.
Allah chooses from the angels messengers, and also from mankind; verily, Allah is Hearer and Seer.
He knows what is before them and what is behind them; and unto Allah all things return.
O you who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves (in obeisance), and serve your Lord, and do good, that per chance (or possibly) you may prosper;
And strive in the cause of Allah, with the effort which is His due. He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you any hardship (or hindrance) in religion - the faith of your father Abraham. He has named you Muslims of old and in this (Scripture), that the Messenger may be a witness against you, and that you may be witnesses against mankind. So establish regular (and correct) prayer, give regular (and correct) charity, and hold fast to Allah; He is your Protecting Friend; a blessed Patron and blessed Helper.
Successful indeed are the believers (or the believers will eventually win) 
Who in their prayers are humble,
And who shun vain talk, 
And who are constantly active in charitable works.
And who abstain from sexual immodesty (or guard their modesty or chastity or sexual purity).
Except for with those joined with them in marriage or the captive whom their right hand possesses, for then, verily, they are free from blame.
But whoever craves aught beyond that, they are the transgressors
And those who faithfully observe their trusts and covenants,
And who guard well (pay heed to) their prayers:
These will be the heirs, 
Who shall inherit Paradise; they shall dwell therein.
We have created man from an extract of clay; 
Then We made him a drop (sperm) in a safe depository (the womb); 
Then We made the drop into a clot, and We made the clot into a lump (foetus); then We made the lump into bone, and We clothed the bone with flesh; then We produced from it another creature. Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators.
Then shall you after that surely die;
Then, lo! On the Day of Resurrection shall you surely be raised.
And We have created above you seven paths; and We are never heedless of creation.
And We send down from the heaven water by measure, and We make it rest in the earth; but, verily, We are able to withdraw it.
Then We produce for you thereby gardens of date-palms and grapes wherein you have much fruits, and whereof you eat.
And a tree growing out of Mount Sinai (Olives) which produces oil, and a relish for eaters.
And, verily, you have a lesson in the cattle; We give you to drink of what is in their bodies; and you have therein many uses, and of them you eat, 
And on them and on ships you are carried.
We sent Noah unto his people, and he said, "O my people! Serve Allah, you have no God but Him; do you then not fear (evil)?"
Said the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people, "This is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who wishes to make himself superior to you. Had Allah pleased He could surely have sent angels. We have not heard of this from our forefathers.
"He is nothing but a man possessed; so watch him for a while."
Said he, "My Lord! Help me, for they deny me."
And We inspired him, saying "Make the ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration; and when the oven (of Allah's wrath) boils over (or the fountains or springs of the earth are about to gush forth), conduct into it of every kind two spouses, and your household, except them against whom the Word has already gone forth. And plead not on behalf of those who do wrong, verily, they will be drowned.
"But when you are settled, you and those with you in the ark, say, "Praise belongs to Allah, Who saved us from the unjust people."
"And say, 'My Lord! Cause me to land on a blessed landing place, for you are the best of all who bring to land.'" 
Verily, in this is a sign, and, verily, We are ever trying them (mankind).
Then We raised up after them another generation; 
And We sent amongst them a messenger of their own (or from among them), saying, "Serve Allah, you have no God but He; will you then not fear (evil)?"
Said the chiefs of the people who disbelieved, and denied the meeting in the Hereafter, and to whom We gave enjoyment in the life of this world, "This is only a mortal like yourselves, who eats of what you eat, and drinks of what you drink;
"If you obey a mortal like yourselves, verily, you will then be surely losers.
"Does he promise you that when you are dead, and have become dust and bones, that then you will be brought forth?
"Be gone, be gone, with that which you are promised (or it is far-fetched).
"There is only our life in this world. We die and we live, and we shall not be raised again.
"He is only a man who invents a lie about Allah. And we believe him not."
Said he, "My Lord! Help me, for they deny me." 
He said, "Within a little while they will surely be sorry!"
Then the blast seized them rightfully; and We made them as rubbish borne by a torrent (of Time); so, away with the wrong-doing people!
Then after them We brought forth other generations. 
No nation (or people) can hasten its appointed term, nor delay it.
Then We sent Our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came unto any nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another (to disaster); and We made them bywords. Away then with a people who believe not!
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs, and with plain authority
To Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they were inflated with pride, and were a despotic people.
And they said, "Shall we believe two mortals like ourselves, and whose people are servile unto us?"
So they accused them of lying, and became of those who perished.
And We verily gave Moses the Book, that per chance (or possibly) they might be guided.
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign; and We gave them both shelter on high, a place of security and springs.
O you messengers! Eat of the good things and do right; verily, I am aware of what you do.
And, verily, this your religion (or brotherhood) is one religion (or brotherhood), and I am your Lord; so keep your duty unto Me.
But they (mankind) have broken their religion (or affair) between them into sects, each sect rejoicing in its own tenets.
So leave them in their confused error (or ignorance) for a time.
Think they that in the wealth and children, wherewith We provide them
We hasten unto them with good things? Nay, but they perceive not.
Verily, those who walk in awe of their Lord, 
And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord,
And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord
And those who give what they give with heart afraid because they are about to return unto their Lord,
These race to good things, and they shall be the first in the race.
But We will not oblige a soul beyond its capacity; for with us is a Record that utters the truth, and they shall not be wronged.
Nay, their heart are in ignorance of this, and they do deeds beside this which they continue to do, 
Until, when We catch the affluent ones amongst them with the punishment, then lo! They cry in supplication.
Supplicate not this day! Assuredly, you will not be helped by (or against) Us. 
My revelations were recited to you, but you turned back upon your heels,
In arrogant scorn thereof, raving vain nonsensical tales by night.
Have they not pondered over the words, or has something new come unto them which came not to their forefathers?
Or know they not their messenger that they thus deny him? 
Or do they say, "He is possessed"? Nay, but he came to them with the Truth, and most of them are haters of Truth.
But if the truth were to conform to their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth and whoever is therein would be corrupted. Nay, We brought them their Reminder (The Quran), but from their Reminder they now turn away.
Or do you ask them for a tribute? But the bounty of your Lord is better, for He is the best of those who provide.
And, verily, you do call them to the Straight Way; 
But, verily, those who believe not in the Hereafter, they are indeed astray from that Way.
But if We had mercy on them, and relieved their distress, they still would persist in their rebellion, blindly wandering on.
And We caught them with the punishment, but they humble not themselves before their Lord, nor do they pray,
Until, when We open for them the gate of extreme torment, then lo! They are plunged into despair.
He it is who produced for you hearing and sight, and heart (or feelings, understanding, mind). Little thanks give you. 
And He it is Who has sown you broadcast in the earth, and unto Him shall you be gathered. 
And He it is Who gives you life and death; and His is the alternation of the night and the day; have you then no sense?
Nay, but they say the like of that which those of yore did say.
They said, "What! When we have become earth and bones, are we then going to be raised again? 
"We were already promised this, we and our forefathers. Lo! this is naught but old folks' tales!"
Say, "Whose is the earth and those who are therein, if you have knowledge?"
They will say, "Allah's." Say, "Will you then not remember?"
Say, "Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Mighty Throne?"
They will say, "Allah." Say, "Will you then not keep your duty unto Him?"
Say, "In whose hand is the dominion over all things; He succours (or protects) but is not succoured (or needs no protection or against whom there is no protection), if you did but know?"
They will say, "Allah's". Say, "How then can you be so deluded?"
Nay, We have brought them the Truth, but, verily, they are Liars!
Allah never took a son, nor was there ever any God with Him; else would each God have assuredly gone off with (or championed, controlled) that which he had created, and some would assuredly have exalted themselves over (or overcome) others. Glorified be Allah above all that they attribute (to Him)!
Knower of the invisible and the visible, exalted be He above what they associate with Him!
Say, "My Lord! if you should show me what they are promised,
My Lord! Then place me not amongst the wrong-doing people."
And verily We are able to show you that which We have promised them.
Repel evil by that which is best. We are best Aware of that which they allege.
And say, "My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from the suggestions of the devils; 
And I seek refuge in Thee from their presence!"
Until when death comes to any one of them he says, "My Lord! Send me back,
That I may do right in that which I have left behind." Nay! It is but a mere word he speaks; behind them is a barrier until the Day they shall be raised.
And when the trumpet shall be blown, and there shall be no kinship between them on that day, nor will they ask about each other then!
And those whose scales are heavy (with good deeds), they are the successful. 
But those whose scales are light, these are they who lose their souls, in hell will they abide.
The fire shall scorch their faces, and they shall curl their lips (in gloom) therein.
(It will be said) "Were not My revelations recited to you? And did you not treat them as falsehoods?"
They will say, "Our Lord our misfortune overcame us, and we became a people astray. 
"Our Lord! Take us out of this, and if we return to evil, then shall we be unjust indeed."
He will say, "Be gone into it, and speak you not to Me."
"Verily, there was a sect of My servants who used to pray, "Our Lord! We believe, so forgive us, and have mercy upon us, for Thou art the best of the merciful ones."
"But you took them for a jest (treated them with ridicule) until you forgot My reminder and did laugh at them.
"Verily, I have rewarded them this day that they were steadfast; verily, they are indeed triumphant, blissful now.
He will say, "How long a number of years did you tarry on earth?"
They will say, "We tarried but a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep count."
He will say, "You have only tarried a little, if you but knew.
"Did you then think that We created you for jest (or sport, without purpose), and that you would not be returned to Us?"
But exalted be Allah, the True King; there is no God but He, the Lord of the Noble Throne (or Throne of Honour)! 
He who calls unto any other God along with Allah has no proof thereof; verily, his account is only with his Lord; verily, the disbelievers shall not be successful.
And say, "Lord, Forgive and have mercy, for you are the best of the merciful ones!"
This is a chapter which We have revealed and ordained. In it We have revealed manifest signs in order that you may take heed.
The man and the woman guilty of adultery (fornication, whoring), scourge each of them with a hundred stripes, and let not compassion for them withhold you from obedience to Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day; and let a party of the believers witness their punishment.
Let no adulterer marry any but an adulteress or an idolatress (or unbeliever), nor let any but such a man or an idolater (or unbeliever) marry such a woman. All this is forbidden to believers.
And those who launch a charge (accusations, imputations) on chaste women, but bring not four witnesses, scourge them with eighty stripes, and never afterwards accept their testimony, for these are, indeed, evil-doers (workers of abomination),
Except such as repent after that and make amends, for, verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And those who cast charges (accusations, imputations) against their wives and have no witnesses except themselves, then the testimony of one of them shall be to testify four times that, by Allah, he is of those who speak the truth;
And a fifth, to invoke the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who lie. 
And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bears testimony four times that, by Allah, he is of those who lie; 
And the fifth that the wrath of Allah shall be on her if he be of those who speak the truth.
And were it not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy unto you, and that Allah is Relenting, Wise (he would have been ruined).
Verily, those who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not as an evil for you. Nay, it is good for you. Every man of them shall have what he has earned of sin; and he among them who had the greater share (took the lead), for him is an awful doom.
Why did not, when you heard it, the believers, men and women, think good of their own folk, and say, "This is an obvious lie?"
Why did they not bring four witnesses to it? But since they did not bring witnesses, then verily they stand forth as liars in the sight of Allah.
And but for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, an awful doom would have seized you, for that which you glibly and hastily spread abroad.
Behold, you received it with your tongues, and spoke with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, and deemed it a light thing, while it was most grave in the sight of Allah.
And why, when you heard it, did you not say, "It is not for us to speak of this? Glory be to Thee, O Allah, this is an awful slander!"
Allah admonishes you that you return not to the like of it ever, if you be believers; 
And He expounds to you His revelations, for Allah is Knower, Wise.
Verily, those who love to see slander (or scandal) broadcast amongst the believers, for them is grievous woe in this world and the Hereafter; Allah knows, but you know not.
And but for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy, and that Allah is kind and compassionate....
O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Satan, for he who follows the footsteps of Satan, verily, he bids you filth (the shameful) and wrong. Had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy unto you, not one of you would have grown pure; but Allah causes whom He will to grow (or become purified), for Allah is Hearer, Knower.
And let not those amongst you who have plenty (dignity and ease and ample means) swear that they will not give aught to their kinsman and the needy and those who are fugitives from their homes in the cause of Allah, but let them forgive and show indulgence. Do you not yearn that Allah should forgive you? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Verily, those who slander (cast aspersions) on virtuous (or chaste) women who have been careless (indiscreet) but believing, shall be cursed in this world and the Hereafter; theirs will be an awful doom
On the day when their tongues and hands and feet shall testify against them as to what they used to do, 
On that day Allah will pay them their just due; and they shall know that Allah, He is the Manifest Truth.
Vile (impure) women are for vile (impure) men, and vile men for vile women. Good women are for good men, and good men for good women, such are innocent of what people they say; for them is forgiveness and a noble provision.
O you who believe! Enter not into houses which are not your own, until you have asked permission (announced your presence) and saluted (invoked peace on) the people thereof. That is better for you; per chance (or possibly) you may be mindful.
And if you find no one therein, then enter not until permission is given you, and if it be said unto you, "Go away." then go away, for it is purer for you; Allah knows what you do.
It is no crime against you that you enter uninhabited houses, wherein is comfort for you; but Allah knows what you proclaim and what you hide.
Say to the believing men that they cast down their looks and guard their modesty; that is purer for them; verily, Allah is well aware of what they do.
And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their modesty, and display not their ornaments, except those which are obvious from the outside; and let them pull their veils over their bosoms and not display their ornaments (and beauty) save to their husbands and fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what their right hands possess (slaves), or their male attendants who are incapable (eunuchs or old men), or to children who do not note women's nakedness; and that they beat not with their feet to draw attention to their hidden ornaments; but turn you all to Allah, O you believers, in order that you may succeed (or prosper or attain bliss).
And marry the single amongst you, and the righteous among your slaves and your handmaidens. If they be poor, Allah will enrich them of His grace, for Allah encompasses all and knows all. 
And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste until Allah gives them means from His grace. And if any of your slaves asks for a Deed in writing (an agreement to purchase their freedom), write it for them if you know any good in them; yea, give them something yourselves from out of the wealth Allah has given you. But force not your slave girls to prostitution when they desire chastity, in order to make a gain in goods of this world. But if any one compels them, then, after they are compelled, verily, Allah will be to them (the slave girls) Forgiving, Merciful.
Now have We sent down to you clear revelations, and the example of those who have passed away before you, and as an admonition to those who fear (avoid) evil.
Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth; The similitude of His light is as a niche in which is a lamp, and the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as though it were a brilliant star; it is lit from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east nor of the west, the oil of which would well-nigh glow of itself though no fire touched it; light upon light! Allah guides whom He will to His Light; and Allah strikes out parables for men, and Allah knows all things.
(This lamp is found, or the light is lit) In the houses which Allah has permitted to be exalted and that His name shall be remembered (or mentioned) therein. His praises are celebrated therein mornings and evenings.
By men whom neither merchandise nor selling (commerce) divert from the remembrance of Allah and steadfastness in prayer and charity, who are in awe of the day when heart and eyes shall be transformed,
That Allah may reward them for the best of that which they have done, and give them increase of His bounty; for Allah gives blessings without stint to whom He will.
But those who disbelieve, their works are like the mirage in a desert, the thirsty suppose it to be water till when he comes to it he finds nothing, but he finds, instead, Allah is with him; and He will pay him his account, for Allah is quick to take account.
Or like darkness on a deep sea. There covers it a wave above which is another wave, above which is a cloud, layers of darkness upon darkness; when he puts out his hand he can scarcely see it; for him to whom Allah has given no light, he has no light.
Have you not seen that Allah, He it is whom praise all who are in the heavens and the earth, and the birds in their flight? Each one knows its worship and its praise, and Allah is aware of what they do?
And unto Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah is the journeying.
Have you not seen how Allah drives the clouds gently, and then gathers them together, then heaps them up (or layers them)? Then you may see the rain coming forth from their midst; and He sends down from the sky mountainous masses wherein is hail; He smites therewith whom He pleases, and averts it from whom He pleases; the flashing of His lightning well-nigh blinds the sight.
Allah alternates the night and the day. Verily, in all these things is a lesson to those endowed with vision.
And Allah created every beast from water, and of them are some that creep upon their bellies, and some that walk upon two legs, and some walk upon four. Allah creates what He wills; verily, Allah has power over all things.
We have, indeed, sent down revelations which make things (hidden) manifest, and Allah guides whom He pleases unto the Straight Way.
They say, "We believe in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey." But after that some of them turn their backs; they are not really believers.
And when they appeal to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, lo! A section of them is averse. 
But had the right been on their side they would have come unto Him willingly enough.
Is there in their heart a disease, or do they doubt, or do they fear lest Allah and His Messenger should deal unjustly by them?- Nay, it is they who do wrong (or are unjust).
The speech of the believers, when they appeal unto Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, is only to say, "We hear and we obey;" and such are the successful.
He who obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, such indeed are the victorious.
They swear by Allah with their most solemn oath that had you ordered them they would surely go forth. Say, "Swear not; obedience is more reasonable; verily, Allah is Informed of what you do."
Say, "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away then it is for him to do only that wherewith he has been charged, and for you to do only that wherewith you have been charged. If you obey him, you are rightly guided. But the Messenger has no other charge but to convey the message plainly."
Allah promises those of you who believe and do right that He will give them the succession (or make them inheritors to the present rulers), in the earth even as He gave the succession to those before them; and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and to give them, after their fear, safety in exchange. They shall serve Me, they shall not associate partners with Me: but those who disbelieve henceforth, they are the rebellious miscreants. 
Establish regular worship and regularly pay the Zakah (the poor-tax) and obey the Messenger, in order that you may obtain mercy.
Think not that those who disbelieve can frustrate (the plan of Allah) on earth; their resort is the Fire, and it is indeed an ill destination.
O you who believe! Let those whom your right hands possess (slaves), and the children amongst you who have not reached puberty, ask leave of you on three occasions (before coming into your presence) - before the prayer of dawn, and when you put off your clothes because of the heat at noon, and after the evening prayer - three occasions of privacy (or undress) for you. It is no sin on either you or them at other times, to go about attending to each other (without express permission). Thus does Allah explain to you His revelations, for Allah is Knower, Wise.
And when your children reach puberty let them ask leave as those before them asked leave. Thus does Allah explain to you His revelations, for Allah is Knower, Wise.
And women past childbearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no crime for them if they discard their outer garments in such a way as not to display their adornments. But to refrain is better for them, for Allah is Hearer, Knower.
There is no blame upon the blind, nor blame upon the lame, nor blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if you eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your paternal uncles, or the houses of your paternal aunts, or the houses of your maternal uncles, or the houses of your maternal aunts, or those whereof you possess the keys, or of your friend. There is no crime upon you that you eat all together or separately. But when you enter houses, then greet each other with a salutation from Allah, blessed and pure. Thus does Allah explain to you His revelations in order that you may understand.
Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are with him (the Messenger) upon some common business, go not away until they have asked leave of him. Verily, those who ask your leave they it is who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So, if they ask your leave for any of their own concerns, then give leave to whomever you will of them, and ask for them forgiveness of Allah; verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Make not the calling (or summons) of the Messenger among you like your calling (or summons) one to the other. Allah knows those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let those who conspire to evade his orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall them.
Verily, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He knows their condition, and the Day when they shall be returned unto Him so that He may inform them of what they did. Allah is Knower of all things.
Blessed is He Who has revealed unto His servants the Discrimination (or Criterion) that it may be an admonition to all peoples.
He unto Whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He has chosen no son nor has He any partner in the sovereignty. He has created everything, and then given it its measure (proportions).
Yet they take beside Him other gods who create not aught, but are themselves created, and cannot control harm or profit for themselves, and can control neither death, nor life, nor resurrection.
And those who disbelieve say, "This is nothing but a lie which he has invented, and another people hath helped him with it;" But, in truth, it is they who have wrought an injustice and a falsehood.
And they say, "Old folks' tales, which he has written down while they are dictated to him morning and evening."
Say, "He Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth, He has revealed it; verily, He is ever Forgiving, Merciful!"
And they say, "What ails this messenger that he eats food and walks in the markets? Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a Warner with him.... 
Or a treasure thrown down unto him, or why has he not a garden to eat from....?" And the unjust say, "You  only follow a man bewitched (or obsessed)."
See how they coin similitudes for you, so that they are all astray and cannot find a way!
Blessed is He Who, if He will, can make for you better than all that - Gardens beneath which rivers flow - and can make for you castles (mansions, palaces).
Nay, but they deny the coming of the Hour, and for those who deny the Hour We have prepared a blaze: 
When it sees them from a far place, they shall hear its raging and roaring; 
And when they are thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they shall pray for destruction there.
Pray not that day for one destruction, but pray for many destructions!
Say, "Is that better or the Garden of Eternity (Immortality) which is promised unto those who fear (ward off evil), which is ever a reward and a goal? 
Therein abiding, they shall have all that they desire. It is for your Lord a promise that must be fulfiled.
And on the day when He will gather them and that which they served beside Allah, He will say, "Was it you who misled these my servants or did they themselves wander from the way?"
They will say, "Be you glorified! It was not befitting for us to take any patrons besides Thee; but Thou didst give them and their fathers ease until they forgot the Reminder and became a lost people!"
And thus have they proved you liars for what you say, and you cannot avert or obtain help. And he among you who does wrong, We will make him taste great torment.
We have not sent before you any messengers, but lo! They ate food and walked in the markets; but We have made some of you a test for others: will you be steadfast? your Lord is ever Seer.
And those who look not for a meeting with Us say, "Why are angels not sent down to us, or we do not see our Lord?" Assuredly they have an arrogant conceit of themselves and excessive is their insolence.
On the day when they behold the angels, there will be no good tidings for the guilty; and the angels will say, "There is a forbidden barrier for you."
And We will turn on to the works which they have done, and make them like dust scattered.
The companions of the Garden on that day shall be in a better abiding-place and a better noonday rest.
The day the heavens shall be cleft asunder with the clouds, and the angels shall be sent down, descending in ranks.
The true kingdom (sovereignty, dominion) on that day shall belong to the Beneficent, and it shall be a hard day for the disbelievers.
And the day when the wrongdoers shall bite his hands and say, "O, would that I had chosen the way with the Messenger. 
"O, woe is me! Would that I had not taken such a one for a friend.
"He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan is ever a deserter of men."
And the Messenger says, "My Lord! Verily, my own people have made this Quran of no account."
Thus have We made for every prophet an opponent from among the guilty; but your Lord is sufficient as good guide and helper.
Those who disbelieve said, "Why is not the Quran sent down to him all at once (in one piece)?" It is revealed as it is so that We may strengthen your heart therewith, and We have rehearsed it to you gradually, in well-arranged stages.
And they bring you no similitude but We reveal the truth and the best interpretation thereof (or a better argument).
They who shall be gathered upon their faces into hell, such are worse in plight and further from the path.
And We did give to Moses the Book, and placed with him his brother, Aaron, as a minister (or Priest); 
And We said, "Go you together to the people who have denied Our revelations. Then We destroyed them with utter destruction."
And the people of Noah, when they denied the messenger, We drowned them, and made them a sign for mankind. We prepared for the wrongdoers a grievous woe.
And (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud and the people of Ar'Rass, and many generations between them.
For each of them We set forth parables and examples, and each one have We utterly ruined.
Indeed, they have come past the cities which were rained on with an evil rain; have they not seen them? Nay, but they fear not the Resurrection (or hope not for resurrection).
And when they see you (Muhammad) they only took you for a jest, "Is this he whom Allah has sent as a Messenger? 
"He well-nigh leads us astray from our gods, had we not been constant to them." But they shall know, when they see the torment, who errs most from the path. 
Have you considered him who takes for his god his own lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions)? Would you then be guardian over him?
Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are but like the cattle, nay, they are further astray in the path.
Have you not seen how your Lord spreads the shadow? Had He willed He could have made it still - We make the sun its guide,
Then We contract it towards Us with a gradual contraction in easy stages.
And He it is who made the night a covering for you; and sleep for repose, and made the day a resurrection.
And He it is who sent the winds as glad tidings heralding His mercy; and We send down purifying water from the sky.
That We may quicken therewith the dead land, and slake the thirst of the things We have created - beasts and men in great numbers.
And verily, We have repeated it (the lesson) in various ways among them that they may remember; but most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude. 
But, had We pleased, We could have raised a Warner in every village (or population centre).
So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them herewith (with the Quran) with great endeavour.
He it is who has set free the two bodies of water (rivers and seas), one palatable and sweet, and the other salty and bitter, and has set a barrier between them, forbidding passage.
And He it is who has created man from water, and has appointed for him kindred by blood and kindred by marriage for your Lord is ever Powerful.
Yet they worship beside Allah what can neither profit them nor harm them; but the disbeliever is ever a partisan of evil against his Lord.
We have only sent you to give glad tidings and as a Warner.
Say, "I ask you for no reward for this, save that whoever will may choose a way unto his Lord." 
And rely you upon the Living One who dies not; and celebrate His praise; He is sufficient as Knower about the faults of His servants.
He who created the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, in six days, and then mounted the Throne; the Beneficent! Ask any one who is aware concerning Him.
And when it is said unto them, "Adore you the Beneficent", they say, "What is the Beneficent? Shall we adore what you do order us?" And it only increases their aversion.
Blessed be He who placed in the heavens mansions (constellations) of stars, and has placed therein a great lamp and an illuminating moon!
And He it is who made the night and the day alternating, for him who desires to remember or who desires thankfulness.
And the faithful servants of the Beneficent are those who walk upon the earth modestly, and when the ignorant (or foolish) address them, answer, "Peace!"
And those who pass the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing; 
And those who say, "Our Lord! Avert from us the doom of hell; verily, its wrath is indeed a grievous affliction.
"Verily, indeed an evil abode and state."
And those who when they spend are neither extravagant nor miserly, but who always take their stand between the two;
And those who call not upon another god with Allah; nor take the life which Allah has forbidden save in justice; nor commit adultery (or fornication) - for he who does that shall pay the penalty;
The penalty will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgment, and he will abide therein despised forever,
Save he who repents and believes and does righteous work; for such Allah will change their evil deeds to good deeds. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.
And he who repents and does good, verily, he has turned to Allah with true conversion.
And those who will not witness vanity (frivolous, foolish, ignorant, futile and useless things, falsehood); and when they pass by vain (frivolous, foolish, futile, ignorant, false) discourse, pass by with dignity;
And those who when they are reminded of the revelations of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat;
And those who say, "Our Lord! Grant us comfort and cheer from our wives and offspring, and make us models for all those who ward off evil (or to lead the righteous)."
These shall be rewarded with a high place for that they were steadfast: and they will meet therein with welcome and peace,
Abiding therein for ever; a happy abode and state!
Say (to the rejecters), "My Lord is not concerned (or uneased) because of you if you call not on Him (in prayer); but you have denied (Him or the Truth), therefore will there be judgment."
TA SIN MIM. 
 26:2.These are the verses of the Book that clarifies (illuminates);
It may be that you are tormenting your soul that they will not be believers.
If We will, We can send down upon them from heaven a sign which would bend their necks in humility.
But there comes not to them a fresh Reminder from the Beneficent that they did not turn away from. 
They have indeed rejected the message, but soon enough will come to them the truth of that at which they mocked.
Have they not looked to the earth, how We caused to grow therein of every noble kind? 
Verily, in that is indeed a sign; but most of them are not believers.
Lo! Your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
And when your Lord called Moses, saying, "Go to the iniquitous people, 
To the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear (Allah or doing evil)?"
Said he, "My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will call me liar;
"And my breast will be straitened, and my tongue is not fluent; so send then unto Aaron (or send them Aaron),
"For they have a crime against me. And I fear that they may kill me."
Said He, "Not so; but go, both, with Our signs; verily, We are with you listening.
"And go to Pharaoh and say, 'Verily, we bear a message from the Lord of the Worlds 
"(saying) Send you with us the children of Israel.'"
And he said, "Did we not cherish you as a child amongst us? And did you not dwell amongst us for many years of your life?
"And you did do a deed which you know you did do (he slew an Egyptian), and you are of the ungrateful!"
Moses said, "I did commit this, and I was of those who erred.
"And I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord granted me better judgment, and made me one of His messengers; 
"And this is the favour you have reproached me with, that you have enslaved the children of Israel!"
Said Pharaoh, "Who is the Lord of the Worlds? "
Said he, "The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between the two, if you want certainty."
Said he (Pharaoh) to those about him, "Do you not hear?" 
Moses said, "(He is) your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning."
Said he (Pharaoh), "Verily, the messenger who is sent to you is surely mad!"
Moses said, "(He is) The Lord of the East and of the West, and of all that is between the two, if you did but understand."
Said he (Pharaoh), "If you do take a god besides me I will surely place you among the prisoners."
Moses said, "What, if I come to you with something obvious (to the senses)?"
Said he, "Bring it, if you are of those who tell the truth."
And he threw down his rod, and, behold, it was an obvious serpent!
And he plucked out his hand, and, behold, it was white to the spectators!
He (Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him, "Verily, this is a knowing (expert) magician (sorcerer, wizard). 
"He desires to turn you out of your land. What is it then you counsel (advise, suggest)"
They said, "Put him off a while, him and his brother, and send into the cities
"To collect and bring to you every knowing (expert) magician."
And the magicians assembled at the appointed time on a well-known day (a festival day),
And it was said to the people, "Are you assembling?" 
(They said), "Aye, so that we may follow the magicians if they win."
And when the sorcerers came they said unto Pharaoh, "Will we have a sure reward if we win?"
He said, "Yes; and, verily, you shall then be of those who are brought nigh to me (or to my throne in affection and rank)." 
And Moses said to them, "Throw down what you have to throw." 
So they threw down their ropes and their rods and said, "By Pharaoh's might, verily, it is we who shall be the winners."
And Moses threw down his rod, and, lo, it swallowed up what they had falsely devised!
And the magicians threw themselves down, in obeisance. 
Saying, "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,
"The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
Said Pharaoh, "Do you believe in Him ere I give you permission? Surely, he is your leader (in a conspiracy) who has taught you sorcery. But soon you shall know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides, and I will crucify you all together!"
They said, "No matter! Verily, unto our Lord do we (or "will we" or "in any case") return! 
"Verily, we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, for we are the foremost of believers!"
And We inspired Moses, saying, "Journey by night with my servants; verily, you are pursued."
And Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners,
(Who said) "Verily, these are a small company.
"And, verily, they are offenders against us;
"But we are a multitude and wary.
(") So we (or We) expelled them out of gardens and springs,
(") And treasures, and noble positions.(")
Thus it was, but We made the children of Israel inheritors of these things.
And they pursued them at dawn;
And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Moses said, "Verily, we are overtaken!" 
Said he, "Not so; verily, my Lord is with me. He will guide me."
And We inspired Moses, saying, "Strike the sea with your rod." And it was cleft asunder, and each part was like a mighty mountain. 
And then We brought the others thither.
And We saved Moses and those with him, every one;
We drowned the others.
Lo! Herein is indeed a sign: but most of them are not believers.
And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
And recite unto them the story of Abraham; 
When he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?" 
They said, "We worship idols, and we are devoted to them." 
He said, "Can they hear you when you call?
"Or benefit you, or harm you?"
They said, "No; but we found our fathers doing thus."
He said, "Have you considered that which you worship (or serve),
"You  and your forefathers?
"Verily, they are foes unto me, save only the Lord of the Worlds,
"Who created me and does guide me, 
"And who feeds me food and waters me.
"And when I am sick He heals me; 
"He who causes me to die, and then gives me life again,
"And who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgment.
"My Lord, grant me wisdom (or judgment), and let me join the righteous;
"And give me a good report amongst the later generations;
"And place me among the heirs of the Garden of Delight,
"And forgive my father. Verily, he is of those who err; 
"And disgrace me not on the Day when they are raised;
"The Day when wealth shall profit not, nor sons, 
"But only he who comes to Allah with a whole (sound) heart. 
"And the Garden will be brought near to the righteous;
"And Hell shall be brought forth plainly to those who go astray,
"And it will be said unto them, 'Where is all that you used to worship
"Beside Allah? Can they help you, or help themselves?'
"Then they shall be hurled therein, they and the seducers,
"And the hosts of Iblis all together!
"They shall say, while they quarrel therein, 
"'By Allah! In truth, we were in manifest error,
"'When we made you equal to the Lord of the Worlds!
"'It was only the guilty who led us astray. 
"'But now we have no intercessors
"'And no loving friend.
"'Oh, that we had another turn on earth, that we might be of the believers.'"
Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers!
And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
The people of Noah denied the messengers.
When their brother Noah said to them, "Will you not fear (Allah and avoid evil)? 
"Verily, I am a faithful messenger to you; 
"So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 
"I ask you for it no wages; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds.
"So fear Allah and obey me." 
They said, "Shall we believe in you, when the meanest follow you?”
He said, "What knowledge have I of what they were doing;
"Their account is only with my Lord, if you but understood.
"And I am not here to drive away the believers,
"I am only a plain Warner."
They said, "Verily, if you desist not, O Noah! you shall surely be of those who are stoned!"
Said he, "My Lord! Verily, my own people reject me.
"Judge you between us openly, and deliver me and those of the believers who are with me."
So We saved him and those with him in the laden ark,
Then We drowned the rest;
Verily, in this indeed is a sign, yet most of them are not believers;
And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
And (the people of) A'ad denied the messengers; 
When their brother Hud said to them, "Will you not fear? 
"Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger;
"So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
"I ask of you no fee for it; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds.
"Do you build on every height a monument of vain delight?
"And build you fine strong buildings that per chance (or possibly) you may be immortal?
"And when you seize by force, assault you like tyrants?
"Rather fear Allah and obey me; 
And keep your duty to Him who has bestowed on you freely all that you know.
And has aided you with cattle and sons
And gardens and springs.
Verily, I fear for you the retribution of an awful day!"
They said, "It is the same to us if you admonish or are not of those who admonish; 
"This is nothing but the fable of men of old,
"For we are not the ones to be doomed (or tormented)."
And they denied him; therefore, We destroyed them. Verily, in this is a sign, but most of them are not believers.
And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
(The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers; 
When their brother Salih said to them, "Will you not fear? 
"Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger; 
"So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
"I ask not of you any wages; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
"Shall you be left here secure in that which is before us
"In gardens and springs,
"And tilled fields and heavily sheathed palms
"Though you hew out dwellings in the mountain skillfully?
"But keep your duty to Allah and obey me; 
"And obey not the bidding of the extravagant (profligate, wasters),
"Who spread corruption in the earth and mend not their ways."
They said, "You art only of the bewitched; 
"You art but mortal like us; so bring us a sign, if you are truthful."
He said, "Behold this she-camel (a test of faith). She has the right to drink, and you have a right to drink, each on an appointed day; 
"Touch her not with evil, lest there seize you the retribution of an awful day."
But they hamstrung her, and on the morrow they repented; 
So the retribution seized them; verily, in this is a sign; but most of them are not believers:
And verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
The people of Lot denied the messengers; 
When their brother Lot said to them, "Will you not fear (Allah or evil)? 
"Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger; 
"So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
"I ask you not for it any wages; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds.
"Do you approach the males of all creatures of the world,
"And leave the mates your Lord has created for you? Nay, but you are people who transgress."
They said, "Surely, if you do not desist, O Lot! you shall be of those who are expelled!"
Said he, "I am, in truth, of those who hate your conduct;
"My Lord! Save me and my people from what they do."
So We saved him and his people, every one, 
Except an old woman (Lot's wife) amongst those who lingered behind. 
Then We destroyed the others. 
We rained down upon them a shower (of brimstone); and dreadful was the rain for those who had been warned. 
Verily, in this is a sign; yet most of them are not believers. 
And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful,
The Dwellers of the Grove (Midianites) denied the messengers;
Shu'eyb said unto them, "Will you not fear? 
"Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger,
"So do your duty to Allah and obey me.
"I ask not of you for it any wages; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds.
"Give full measure, and be not of those who diminish (give less than due); 
"And weigh with a true balance,
"And wrong (or cheat) not mankind of their goods; and waste not the land, despoiling it;
"And keep your duty unto Him who created you and the generations of the past!" 
Said they, "You art only of the bewitched; 
"And you are only a mortal like ourselves; and, verily, we think that you are surely of the liars;
"So make portions of the heaven fall down upon us, if you are of the truthful!"
Said he, "My Lord knows best what you do!"
But they rejected him, so the torment of the day of gloom (Ashes from a volcanic eruption?) seized them. Lo! It was the retribution of an awful day.
Verily, in this is a sign; but most of them are not believers.
 26:191.Verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
And, verily, it is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds,
Which the Faithful Spirit of Truth (Gabriel) has brought down
Upon your heart, that you may be one of the Warners;
In plain Arabic language,
And, verily, it is also in the scriptures of the past!
 26:197.Is it not a sign for them that the learned men of the children of Israel recognize it? 
Had We sent it down to any one of any other nation but the Arabs,
And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed therein.
 26:200.Thus have We made for it a way into the heart of the guilty;
But they will not believe therein until they see the painful doom.
And it shall come to them suddenly when they perceive not.
They will say, "Shall we be reprieved?"
What! Do they wish to hasten on Our penalty?
What think you? If We let them enjoy life for years,
And then there comes to them that which they are promised,
That which they had to enjoy will avail them not.
But We destroy not any population but it had its Warners
For reminder, for We are never unjust.
No devils (or evil ones) brought down this revelation (the Quran);
It is not fit work for them; nor is it in their power to do so.
Verily, they are banished from listening;
Therefore, call not upon gods other than Allah, lest you be of the doomed.
But warn your people who are near of kin. 
And lower your wing (in kindness and protection as the hen does over its chicks) to those of the believers who follow you; 
But if they rebel against you, say, "Verily, I am innocent of what you do," 
And put your trust (rely) upon the Mighty, the Merciful,
Who sees you when you do stand up (to pray),
And your postures (or movements) among those who prostrate themselves (in obeisance). 
Verily, He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower.
Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend? 
They descend upon every wicked liar, 
And impart what they have heard; but most of them are liars.
As for poets, those follow them who are astray.
Have you not seen how they wander confused in every valley (or by way)? 
And that they say that which they do not do? 
Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and defend themselves after they are wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know with what a turn they shall be turned.
TA SIN. These are the verses of the Quran, a book that clarifies;
A guidance and glad tidings to the believers, 
Who establish regular worship and give regular charity and are sure of the Hereafter.
Lo!, As for those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made for them their works fair-seeming, and they shall wander blindly on.
These are they who shall have grievous torment, and theirs in the Hereafter shall be the greatest loss.
Verily, you receive this Quran from the presence of the Wise, the All-knowing One.
(Remember) When Moses said to his people, "Verily, I perceive a fire, I will bring you there from news; or I will bring you a burning brand that you may be warmed."
 27:8 But when he reached it he was called, with the words, "Blessed is He Who is in the Fire, and He Who is round about it! And glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Worlds! 
"O Moses! Verily, I am Allah, the Mighty, the Wise;
"Throw down your staff!" But when he saw it writhing as though it was a snake, he turned fleeing, and looked not back. (But it was said to him) "O Moses! Fear not; verily, the messengers fear not in My presence.
Save only those who have done wrong and then substitute good for evil; and, verily, I am Forgiving, Merciful!
"Put your hand in they bosom, it shall come forth white without stain (or hurt); one of nine signs to Pharaoh and his people; verily, they are a rebellious, transgressing people."
But when Our signs came to them visibly (that should have opened their eyes), they said, "This is obvious sorcery!" 
And they denied them, though their souls acknowledged them, for spite and arrogance; but behold the nature of the consequences for the evildoers (transgressors)!
And We gave David and Solomon knowledge; and they both said, "Praise belongs to Allah, Who hath favoured us over many of His believing servants."
And Solomon was David's heir. He said, "O you people! We have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given abundance; verily, this is manifest grace!"
And assembled for Solomon were his hosts of the Jinn and of mankind, and birds, and they were marshalled in battle order;
Until, when they came upon the Valley of the Ants, an ant said, "O you ants! Enter your dwellings, that Solomon and his hosts crush you not unperceiving (unknowing)."
And he (Solomon) smiled, laughing at her speech, and said, "O Lord! Excite (cause) me to be thankful for Thy favour, wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and to do righteousness which may please Thee; and include me by Thy Grace amongst Thy righteous servants!"
And he reviewed the birds, and said, "How is it that I see not the hoopoe (perhaps used as a spy, messenger or observer or symbolizing one)? Is he then amongst the absent?
I will surely punish him with a severe penalty; or I will slay him unless he brings me clear authority (or reason for his absence)." 
But he was not long in coming, and said, "I have compassed (covered territory or found out) what you compassed (covered or understood) not; for I come unto you from Sheba with sure information:
"Verily, I found a woman ruling over them, and she was given abundance of all things, and she had a mighty throne; 
"And I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, for Satan had made their works fair-seeming to them, and turned them away from the Way (of Truth), so that they are not guided right.
"So they will not worship Allah, Who brings forth the secrets in the heavens and the earth, and knows what they hide and what they manifest.
"Allah, there is no God but He, the Lord of the Mighty Throne!"
Said he (Solomon), "We will see whether you have told the truth, or whether you are of those who lie.
"Go with this my letter and throw it before them, then turn away from them, and see what answer they return."
Said she (the Queen of Sheba after she had received the letter), "O you chiefs! Verily, a noble letter has been thrown before me. 
"It is from Solomon, and, verily, it is as follows, 'In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
"Exalt not yourself against me, but come to me as those who Surrender (unto Allah i.e. as a Muslim)"
She said, "You  chiefs! Pronounce for me in my affair (or advise me). I never decide an affair until you testify for me."
They said, "We are endowed with strength, and endowed with martial prowess; but the command is yours, so consider what you will command."
She said, "Verily, kings when they enter a city, despoil it, and demean the mighty ones of its people; thus they will do.
"But, verily, I am going to send to them a gift, and will wait to see with what answer the messengers return."
And when the envoy came to Solomon, he (Solomon) said, "Do you offer me wealth, when what Allah has given me is better than what He has given to you? Nay, it is you (not I) who rejoice (exult) in your gifts.
"Return unto them, for we will surely come to them with hosts which they cannot resist; and we will surely drive them out thence with shame and they will be humbled."
Said he, "O you chiefs! Which of you will bring me her throne before they come unto me surrendering?"
Said an Ifrit (a powerful and cunning demon) of the Jinn, "I will bring it you before you can rise up from your chair of council, for I am strong for such work, and trustworthy."
He who had the knowledge of the Book said, "I will bring it to you before your glance can turn." And when he saw it set down beside him, he (Solomon) said, "This is of my Lord's grace that He may try me whether I give thanks or am ungrateful. Whoever gives thanks, gives thanks for the good of his own soul; but he who is ungrateful - truly, my Lord is rich (independent, free of all needs) and Bountiful."
Said he, "Disguise for her throne; let us see whether she is guided, or whether she is of those who receive no guidance."
And when she came it was said unto her, "Is this your throne?" She said, "It was just like this (it could be the one)." and Solomon said, "We were given knowledge before her, and we had Surrendered (to Allah).
"But that which she worshipped beside Allah diverted her; for she came of people who had no faith."
And it was said to her, "Enter the court." And when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she bared her legs (tucked up her skirt to go into it). Said he, "Verily, it is a court paved with glass!" Said she, "My Lord! Verily, I have wronged my soul, but I do now Surrender ( i.e. in Islam) with Solomon to the Lord of the Worlds!"
And We sent unto Thamud their brother Salih, saying "Serve Allah;" but behold! they became two parties quarrelling!
Said he, "O my people! Why do you hasten on evil rather than good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah that you may obtain mercy." 
They said, "We auger evil of you and those who are with you. Said he, "Your augury is in Allah's hands; nay, but you are a people who are being tested."
And there were in the city nine persons who despoiled the land and reformed not. 
Said they, "Swear to each other by Allah that we will surely fall on him and his people by night; then we will surely say unto his family, 'We witnessed not the destruction of his household; and we are truth tellers!'"
And they plotted a plot, and We plotted a plot while they perceive not. 
Behold, what was the nature of the consequences of their plotting, for lo! We destroyed them and their people, everyone.
Thus are their houses in utter ruin, for that they did wrong; verily, in that is a sign to people who have knowledge.
But We saved those who believed and who did fear (or avoid evil).
And Lot when he said to his people, "Do you commit abomination knowingly? 
Must you needs lust after men instead of women? Nay! You are a senseless people." 
But the answer of his people was only to say, "Drive out Lot's family from your city, for they are a folk who would keep pure."
But We saved him and his family except his wife; her We destined to be of those who lingered behind;
And We rained down upon them a shower, and dreadful is the rain for those who have been warned. 
Say, "Praise belongs to Allah; and peace be upon His servants whom He has chosen! Is Allah best, or what they associate as partners with Him?" 
He who created the heavens and the earth; and sends down upon you water from the sky wherewith We cause to grow beautiful orchards, whose trees it has never been yours to grow; is there a God besides Him? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals with Him!
He who made the earth a fixed abode, and placed rivers in its folds; and placed upon it firm mountains; and placed a barrier between the two waters; is there any God besides Allah? Nay, but most of them know not! 
He who answers the distressed when he calls upon Him and removes the evil; and has made you Vicegerents (or Successors) in the earth; is there a God besides Allah? Little do they reflect.
He who guides you in the darkness of the land and of the sea; and He who sends winds as heralds of His mercy; is there a God besides Allah? High exalted be Allah above what they associate with Him! 
He who began the creation and then reproduces it; and who provides for you from the heaven and the earth; is there any God besides Allah? Bring your proofs if you are truthful!
Say, "None in the heavens or the earth knows the unseen save only Allah; and they perceive not when they shall be raised!"
Nay, but does their knowledge reach to the Hereafter? Nay, but they are in doubt concerning it. Nay, but they are blind thereto.
And those who disbelieved say, "What! When we have become dust and (or like) our fathers, shall we indeed be brought forth? 
"We were promised this, we and our fathers before us, this is nothing but ancient fables."
Say, "Travel in the land and see the nature of the sequel for the guilty!
And grieve not you for them, and be not in distress because of what they plot."
They say, "When shall this promise be if you do tell the truth?"
Say; "It may be that a part of what you would hasten is pressing close behind you! 
But, verily, your Lord is full of grace to mankind, but most of them will not be thankful; 
Verily, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest;
And there is no secret thing in the heaven or the earth, save that it is in a Clear Record.
Verily, this Quran relates to the people of Israel most of that whereon they do dispute;
And, lo! It is a guidance and a mercy to the believers.
Verily, your Lord decides between them by His Wisdom (or Judgment), for He is the Mighty, the Wise. 
Rely you then upon Allah, for you stand on obvious Truth.
Verily, you can not make the dead to hear, nor can you make the deaf to hear the call when they turn to flee;
Nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You can make none to hear, save those who believe Our revelations and have Surrendered.
And when the word is fulfiled against them We will bring forth a beast out of the earth (gross materialism?) that shall speak to (or wound) them, because mankind had not faith in Our revelations.
And the Day when We will gather from every nation a troop of those who denied our revelations, and they shall be marshalled; 
Until, when they come before their Lord, He will say, "Did you deny my revelations when you had compassed no knowledge thereof? Or what is it that you were doing?"
And the Word shall be fulfiled concerning them because they did wrong, and they will not be able to speak.
Did they not see that how We have made the night for them to rest in, and the day to see by? Verily, in that are signs to people who believe.
And the Day when the trumpet shall be blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth shall be startled in fear (or horrified), save whom Allah wills. And all shall come unto Him, humbled.
And you see the mountains (things seemingly firm and reliable) which you do deem firm, drifting away like the passing of the clouds - the work of Allah who orders all things. Verily, He is well aware of what you do!
He who brings a good deed shall have better than its worth; and from the alarm of that day they shall be safe:
But those who bring an evil deed shall be thrown down upon their faces in the Fire. Shall you be rewarded save for what you did?
(Say) I (Muhammad) am commanded to serve the Lord of this land (Mecca) which He has made sacred, and unto Whom belong all things. And I am commanded to be of those who Surrender (unto Him),
And to recite the Quran; And he who is guided right, is guided right only for his own soul; and as for him who goes astray - say unto him, "I am only of those who warn!"
And say, "Praise be to Allah, Who will show you His signs so that you shall recognize them; for your Lord is not heedless of what you do!"
TA SIN MIM. 
 28:2.These are the verses of the Book (Scripture) that clarifies.
We narrate unto you something from the history of Moses and Pharaoh with truth unto a people who believe.
Verily, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and divided the people thereof into sects (and casts); one section of them he oppressed, slaughtering their sons and sparing their women. Verily, he was of those who work corruption.
And We wished to be gracious to those who were weakened by oppression in the earth, and to make them models, and to make them the inheritors;
And to establish them firmly in the earth; and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that which they feared from them.
And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying, "Suckle him; and when you are afraid for him then float him into the river, and fear not and grieve not; verily, We shall restore him to you, and make him of one of Our Messengers."
And Pharaoh's family picked him up that he might become for them a foe and a grief; for verily, Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinners.
And Pharaoh's wife said, "He is a joy to my eyes, and to yours. Kill him not; it may be that he will profit us, or that we may take him for a son;" for they perceived not.
And the heart of the mother of Moses became void (empty) on the morrow; she well nigh disclosed him, had We not strengthened her heart that she might be of the believers.
And she said to his (Moses') sister, "Follow him up." And she (his sister) watched him from afar (or as a stranger), and they perceive not.
And We made unlawful (or unacceptable) for him the wet-nurses. And she (his sister) said, "Shall I guide you to the people of a house who will bring him up for you, and who will be sincere and devoted?"
So We restored him to his mother that her eye might be cheered, and that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them understand not.
And when he reached maturity and was firmly established, We gave him Wisdom and Knowledge; for thus do We reward those who do good. 
And he entered into the city at a time when the people thereof were heedless, and he found therein two men fighting; the one of his own sect and the other of his enemies. And he who was of his sect asked his aid against him who was of his enemies. So Moses smote him with his fist and made an end of him. Said he, "This is of the work of Satan, for verily, he is an enemy that manifestly misleads."
He said, "My Lord! Verily, I have wronged my soul, but forgive me." So He forgave him; verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
He said, "My Lord! For that you have been gracious to me, I will never more be a supporter of the guilty."
And on the morrow he was in the city, fearing, vigilant. And behold, he whom he had helped the day before, cried again to him for help. Moses said unto him, "Verily, you are obviously quarrelsome (a hothead).
And when he would have attacked him who was the enemy to them both, he said, "O Moses! Would (or desire) you to slay me as you did slay a person yesterday? You  would be (or are or desire to be) only a tyrant in the earth; and you would not be (or are not or desires not to be) of the reformers."
And a man came from the remote parts of the city running. He said, "O Moses! Verily, the chiefs are deliberating concerning you to slay you; therefore go forth; verily, I am to you a sincere adviser!"
So he went forth there from, fearing, vigilant. Said he, "Lord, save me from the unjust people!"
And when he turned his face towards Midian, he said, "It may be that my Lord will guide me to a smooth and straight path!" 
And when he came unto the water of Midian he found thereat a group of people watering their flocks. And he found apart from them two women keeping back their flocks. Said he, "What is the matter with you?" They said, "We cannot water our flocks until the herdsmen have finished; for our father is a very old man."
So he watered their flock for them; then he turned aside into the shade and said, "My Lord! Verily, I stand in need of what good Thou sends down to me."
And one of the two women came to him walking shyly; said she, "Verily, my father calls you, to reward you with a payment for that you did water our flocks for us." And when he came to him and related to him his whole story, he said, "Fear not, you are safe here from the unjust people."
One of the two women said, "O my father! Hire him; verily, the best of those whom you can hire is the strong and faithful."
Said he, "Verily, I desire to marry you to one of these daughters of mine, on condition that you do serve me for hire eight years; and if you shall fulfil ten it is of your own accord; for I desire not to make it hard for you. Allah willing, you will find me of the righteous."
Said he, "That is settled between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there will be no ill-will (or injustice) against (or in) me, for Allah is surety over (witness of or approves of) what we say."
And when Moses had fulfiled the appointed time, and was travelling with his people, he perceived in the mountain a fire and said to his family, "Tarry you here; verily, I have perceived a fire; I hope to bring you tidings thence, or a brand of fire that you may warm yourselves."
And when he came to it he was called by a voice, from the right side of the valley, in the blessed field, out of a tree, "O Moses! Verily, I am Allah the Lord of the Worlds;
So throw down your rod." And when he saw it writhing as though it were a snake, he turned away and fled and did not turn. "O Moses! Approach and fear not, verily, you are amongst the secure."
Thrust your hand into your bosom, it shall come out white, without hurt; and then fold again your wing, that you do now stretch out through dread (i.e. guard your heart from fear); for these are two signs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Verily, they are a people who are rebellious and wicked."
Said he, "My Lord! Verily, I have killed a person amongst them, and I fear that they will kill me:
"My brother Aaron, he is more eloquent of tongue than I; send him then with me to verify (confirm, support) me. Verily, I fear that they will deny me."
He said, "We will strengthen your arm with your brother; and We give you both authority (or power), and they shall not reach (touch) you for Our signs (they will make you triumphant). You  two and those who follow you shall gain the upper hand."
And when Moses came to them with Our manifest signs, they said, "This is naught but invented magic; we have not heard of this amongst our forefathers."
Moses said, "My Lord is best aware of who comes with guidance from Him, and whose end shall be the best. Verily, the unjust shall not be successful."
And Pharaoh said, "O you chiefs! I know of no God for you except me; then set me a Fire, O Haman! To bake some clay and make for me a tower, so that I may mount up to the God of Moses; for, verily, I think he is of those who lie!"
And he became inflated with pride, he and his armies in the land, without justification; and thought that they would not be returned to Us.
And We overtook him and his army, and We flung them into the sea; behold, then, what was the end of the unjust!
But We made them models (examples or leaders) calling (or leading) to the fire; and on the Day of Resurrection they shall not be helped.
And We followed them up in this world with a curse; and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be among the abhorred!
And We gave Moses the Book, after that We had destroyed the former generations, to give insight to mankind, and a guidance and a mercy; per chance (or possibly), they may reflect.
You (Muhammad) were not upon the Western side when We expounded unto Moses his mission, nor were you of the witnesses (of those events) 
But We raised up other generations, and long were the ages that passed over them; but you were not a dweller among the people of Midian, reciting to them Our signs; but We kept sending our Messengers.
Nor were you by the side of the mountain when We called; yet are you sent as a mercy from your Lord, that you may warn a people to whom no Warner has come before you  that per chance (or possibly) they may be give heed.
Otherwise, if a disaster should befall them for what their hands have sent before, they should say, "Our Lord! Why did Thou not send to us a messenger that we might have followed Thy revelations and been of the believers?"
But when the truth comes to them from Us they say, "Why are not signs given to him the like of what Moses was given." Did they not disbelieve in what Moses was given before? They say, "Two works of sorcery back up each other (The Torah and the Quran)." And they say, "Verily, we do disbelieve in both."
Say, "Bring, then, a book from Allah which shall be a better guide than both that I may follow it, if you are truthful."
And if they cannot answer you, then know that they follow their own lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions); and who is more in error than he who follows his own lust without guidance from Allah? Verily, Allah guides not a wrong doing people.
And We caused the Word to reach them, per chance (or possibly) they may be mindful.
Those to whom We gave the Book before it (the Quran), they believe therein;
And when it is recited to them they say, "We believe in it. It is the Truth from Our Lord. Verily, we were, even before it came, of those who Surrender (or were Muslim)." 
These shall be given their reward twice over, because they were steadfast, and repelled evil with good, and spend of what We have bestowed upon them.
And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say, "We have our works, and you have your works. Peace be upon you! We do not seek the ignorant."
Verily, you can not guide whom you do like, but Allah guides whom He wills; for He knows best who are to be guided.
And they say, "If we follow the Guidance we shall be snatched away from the land." Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary, to which are imported the fruits of all things as a provision from Us? But most of them know not.
How many a community have We destroyed that exulted in its means of subsistence? Yonder are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them, except for a while. And We, even We, are the inheritors.
But your Lord would never destroy a community until He has sent to its centre a messenger to recite to them Our signs; nor would We destroy populations unless their people practiced iniquity.
Whatever thing you may be given, it is a provision for the life of this world and the adornment thereof; but that which Allah has is better and more enduring. Have you then no sense?
Is He to whom We have promised a goodly promise, which he shall meet with, like him to whom We have given the enjoyment in the life of this world, and who on the Day of Resurrection shall be of the arraigned (brought up to deserve punishment )?
And on the Day when He will call them and say, "Where are My partners which you imagined?" 
And those concerning whom the Word will have come true shall say, "Our Lord! These are those whom we have seduced away; we seduced them as we were seduced ourselves: but we declare our innocence before Thee  - they did not worship us."
And it will be said, "Call upon your pretend partners; and they will call upon them, but they will not answer them, and they shall see the Doom. Ah, would that they had been guided right!
And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say, "What was it you answered the messengers?"
And history shall be obscure to them on that day, nor shall they ask each other.
But, as for him who repents and believes and does right, it may be that he will be among the successful.
For your Lord brings to pass what He pleases and chooses; they have never the choice! Glorified be Allah and exalted above all they associate with Him!
Your Lord knows what they conceal in their breasts and what they manifest.
He is Allah; there is no God but He; to Him belongs all praise, in the first place (or state) and the last; and His is the command; and unto Him shall you return!
Have you considered, if Allah were to make for you the night endless until the Day of Resurrection, who is the god, but Allah, to bring you light? Will you not then hear?
Say, "Have you considered, if Allah were to make for you the day endless until the Day of Judgment, who is the god, except Allah, to bring you the night to rest therein? Can you not then see?"
But of His mercy He has made for you the night and the day, that you may rest therein, and crave of His grace, per chance (or possibly) you may give thanks.
And the day when He shall call them and say, "Where are my partners whom you did pretend were such?" 
And We will pluck from every nation a witness; and We will say, "Bring your proof and know that the truth belongs to Allah". And that which they had devised shall stray away from them.
Qarun (Korah) was of the people of Moses, but he behaved insolently (oppressed them); and We gave him so much treasure that the keys thereof would have been a burden on men endowed with strength. When his people said to him, "Exult not; verily, Allah loves not those who exult in riches,
"But seek the abode of the Hereafter through what Allah has given you, and forget not your portion in this world, and do good as Allah has done good to you; and seek not corruption in the earth; verily, Allah loves not corrupters."
Said he, "I have only been given it because of the knowledge which I possess." Knew he not that Allah had destroyed before him many generations of those who were mightier than he in strength and greater in following? But the guilty are not asked immediately concerning their sins.
And he went out amongst the people in his pomp. Those who desired the life of this world said, "O would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is lord of mighty fortune!"
But those who had been given knowledge said, "Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for him who believes and does right; but none shall obtain it except the steadfast.
So We caused the earth to open up and swallow him with his house; and he had no troop to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who could save themselves."
And on the morrow those who had yearned for his place the day before said, "Ah! Allah enlarges provision to whom He pleases of His servants, or He restricts it for whom He will. Had not Allah been gracious unto us, the earth would have cleft open and swallowed us also. Ah! The unbelievers never prosper."
That Home of the Hereafter, We assign it unto those who seek not arrogant oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption, and the end is for the righteous.
He who brings a good deed shall have better than it; and he who brings an evil deed - those who do evil deeds shall only be rewarded for that which they have done.
Verily, He who hath ordained the Quran for you will surely bring you back to the Place of Return (Mecca or Home in Heaven). Say, "My Lord knows best who brings guidance, and who is in error manifest.
You  had no hope that the Book (Scripture) would be inspired in you, but it is a mercy from your Lord! Be not, therefore, a helper of those who disbelieve,
And let them not divert you from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down to you; but call mankind unto your Lord and be not of the idolaters.
And call not upon any other God along with Allah; there is no God but He. Everything is perishable (or will perish), except His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him shall you return!
ALIF LAM MIM. 
Do men imagine that they will be left alone because they say, "We believe," and not be tested?
We did try those who were before you, and Allah will surely know those who are sincere, and He will surely know those who feign. 
Do those who do evil reckon that they can outstrip Us? Evil is it that which they judge.
He who looks forward to the meeting with Allah, - verily, the appointed time is surely nigh, and He is the Hearer and Knower.
And he who strives, strives only for his own soul; for verily, Allah is altogether Independent of (His) creatures (or the worlds).
Those who believe and do right, We will surely blot out all evil from (or in) them; and reward them according to the best of their deeds (or with better than their deeds).
We have enjoined on man kindness to parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return, and I will inform you of that which you did.
But those who believe and do right, We will surely make them enter amongst the righteous.
And there are those among men who say, "We believe in Allah!" but when they suffer for the sake of Allah, they mistake the persecution of men for the punishment of Allah; but if help come from your Lord they will say, "Verily, we were with you!" Is not Allah best aware of what is in the breasts of His creatures? 
Allah surely knows those who believe, and surely knows the hypocrites.
And those who disbelieved said to those who believed, "Follow our way (religion), we will bear your sins. But they cannot bear aught of their sins; verily, they are liars! 
But they shall surely bear their own burdens, and other burdens besides their own; and they shall surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they devised.
And We sent Noah to his people, and he dwelt among them for a thousand save fifty years; and the deluge engulfed them while they persisted in evil-doing.
But We saved him and the company of the ark, and made it a sign unto the worlds (all peoples or creatures).
And Abraham, when he said to his people, "Serve Allah and fear Him, that is better for you if you did but know. 
"You  serve instead of Allah only idols and you only invent a lie; verily, those whom you serve beside Allah own (control) no provision for you. So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks to Him; unto Him shall you return.
But if you deny this, then know that nations before you have denied it. The messenger has only to convey the message plainly."
See they not how Allah produces creation, and then reproduces it? Verily, for Allah it is easy.
Say, "Travel you in the earth, and behold how Allah originated creation; so will He produce a later creation. Verily, Allah has power over all things."
"He punishes whom He will, and bestows mercy on whom He will; and towards Him are you turned.
"You cannot make Him powerless (escape Him) in the earth, nor in the heavens; nor have you beside Allah a friend or a helper.
"And those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and in their meeting with Him, these shall despair of My mercy; and for these is grievous woe."
But the answer of his people was only to say, "Kill him" or "Burn him!" But Allah saved him from the fire; verily, in that are signs unto a people who have faith.
He said, "Verily, you take beside Allah idols, through mutual friendship in the life of this world; but on the Day of Judgment you shall deny each other, and shall curse each other, and your resort shall be the fire, and you shall have none to help."
And Lot believed him and said, "Verily, I flee unto (or for the sake of) my Lord! Verily, He, only He, is the Mighty, the Wise."
And We granted Abraham Isaac and Jacob; and We placed in his seed the Prophethood and the Scriptures; and We gave him his reward in this world; and, verily, in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous."
And Lot! (Remember) When he said to his people, "Verily, you commit an abomination such as no creature did before you.
"Do you approach men? And cut off the highway? And practice wickedness in your assemblies?" But his people gave no answer but this, "Bring us the Wrath of Allah, if you speak the truth."
Said he, "My Lord! Help me against a people who do evil!"
And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the glad tidings, they said, "We are about to destroy the people of these cities. Verily, the people thereof are evil-doers."
Said he, "Verily, in it is Lot." They said, "We are best aware of who is therein; we shall of a surety save him and his people, except his wife, who is of those who lag behind." 
And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was troubled on account of them, and felt powerless to protect them. But they said, "Fear not, neither grieve; we are about to save you and your people, except your wife, who is of those who lag behind. 
"Verily, we are about to send down upon the people of this city a horror from heaven, for that they are evil-livers."
And, verily, of that We have left a manifest sign unto a people who have sense.
And unto Midian We sent their brother Shu'eyb, and he said, "My people, serve Allah, and fear the Last Day; and do not evil, making mischief in the land, (despoiling it)."
But they denied him; and the convulsion seized them, and on the morrow they lay prostrate in their dwellings.
And A'ad and Thamud! But their fate is plain to you from their ruined habitations. Satan made their deeds fair seeming unto them, and turned them from the Way, gifted with intelligence and skill though they were.
And Korah, Pharaoh and Haman! Moses did come to them with clear signs, but they were inflated with pride in the earth. Yet they could not outstrip Us!
And each of them We seized in his sin; and of them were some against whom We sent a sandstorm; and some were caught by a mighty Blast; and some We caused the earth to swallow; and some We drowned. It was not Allah who injured (or oppressed, wronged) them, but it was themselves (or their own souls) they injured (oppressed, wronged).
The similitude of those who choose other patrons than Allah, is as the likeness of a spider, that takes to himself a house; and, lo! The frailest of all houses is the spider's house, if they but knew!
Verily, Allah knows whatever thing they call upon beside Him; for He is the Mighty, the Wise.
As for these similitudes (parables), We have coined for mankind, but none will understand them, save the wise.
Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth. Verily, in this is a sign for those have faith.
Recite what has been inspired in you of the Book; and establish worship. Verily, worship preserves from shameful deeds and iniquity, but surely the remembrance (or mention) of Allah is more important; and Allah knows what you do.
And argue not with the people of the Book, unless with better means; except with those who have done wrong amongst them and say, "We believe in what is sent down to us, and what has been sent down to you; our God and your God is One, and unto Him we Surrender (as Muslims)."
Thus did We send down to you the Book; and those unto whom We gave the Book (Scriptures) before will believe therein, and of these (Pagan Arabs) also there are some who believe therein. None reject Our revelations save disbelievers.
You  (Muhammad) could not recite before this any Book (or Scripture), nor write it with your right hand, for then, indeed, might those who deal (or talk) in vanities (trivialities, falsehoods, irrelevancies) have doubted.
Nay, but it is a clear revelation in the heart of those who are endowed with knowledge, and none deny Our revelations save the wrongdoers (or unjust).
And still they say, "Why have not signs been sent down upon him from his Lord." Say, "Verily, signs are with Allah only, and I am but a plain Warner."
Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book which you do recite to them? Verily, in that is a mercy and a reminder to a people who believe.
Say, "Allah is sufficient witness between me and you. He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and those who believe in vanities (falsehoods, frivolities) and disbelieve in Allah, they it is who are the losers." 
They will wish you to hasten on the doom (punishment); but were it not that a term had been appointed, the doom would have come upon them ere now. And verily it will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not.
They ask you to hurry on the doom, but, verily, hell encompasses the disbelievers!
On the Day when the Doom (or Wrath) shall overwhelm them from above them and from beneath their feet, and He will say, "Taste that which you have done."
O my servants who believe! Verily, My earth is spacious enough; therefore serve Me only.
Every soul must taste of death, then unto Us shall you return.
Those who believe and act right, We will surely house them in lofty (or upper) chambers of the Garden beneath which rivers flow; to dwell therein secure (or for ever) - an excellent reward for the toilers (workers of good),
Those who persevere and put their trust in (or rely on) their Lord!
How many a beast cannot carry its own provision! Allah provides for it and for you; He is the Hearer, the Knower.
And if you should ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth, and subjected the sun and the moon?" they will surely say, "Allah!" how then can they turn away?
Allah extends provision to whomsoever He will of His servants, or restricts it; verily, Allah is aware of all things.
And if you should ask them, "Who causes water to come down from the sky and revives therewith the earth after its death?" they will surely say, "Allah!" Say, "And praise be to Allah!" But most of them have no sense.
This life of the world is nothing but a pastime and game (or a sport and a play); but, verily, the abode of the Hereafter, that is life, if they did but knew!
And when they ride in the ship they call upon Allah, making their religion seem sincere to Him; but when He delivers them safely to the shore, behold, they associate others with Him; 
Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts; and that they may have some worldly enjoyment: but soon they shall come to know.
Have they not seen that We have made a Safe Sanctuary whilst people are being snatched away around them? Is it then that they believe in falsehood, and disbelieve the bounty of Allah?
But who is more unjust than he who devises against Allah a lie, or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in hell a home for the disbelievers?
But those who strive in Our cause, We will surely guide them into Our Way, for, verily, Allah is with those who do right.
Alif Lam Mim. 
The Romans are vanquished,
In a near land, and they, after being vanquished, shall be victorious,
Within a few years. - Allah's is the command before and after; and on that day the believers shall rejoice,
With the help of Allah; He helps whom He pleases; and He is the Mighty, the Merciful.
It is Allah's promise! Allah will not fail His promise, but most of mankind know not.
They know only the outward (appearance) in the life of this world, but of the Hereafter they are heedless.
Do they not reflect within themselves: Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them but with Truth, and for an appointed term (or destined end)? But truly most of the people are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.
Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than these were in power and prowess, and they dug up the earth, and built on it in greater abundance than these have built. There came to them their messengers with clear arguments; Surely Allah dealt not with them unjustly, but they dealt unjustly with their own souls.
Then evil was the end of those who did evil, because they rejected the revelations of Allah and used to mock them.
Allah originates creation, then reproduces it, then to Him will you be returned.
In the Day when the Hour shall come the guilty shall be in despair.
And they shall not have any intercessors from among their gods they have joined with Allah, and they shall be deniers of their associate-gods.
In the Day when the Hour shall come, at that Day they shall be separated.
Then as to those who believed and did good works, they shall be made happy in a Garden.
And as to those who disbelieved and rejected Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter, these shall be brought to the chastisement.
Therefore glory be to Allah when you enter the night and when you enter morning.
Unto Him belongs praise in the heavens and the earth, and at the sun's decline and in the midday.
He brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and He revives the earth after its death, and even so shall you be brought forth.
And one of His signs is this, that He created you from dust, then lo! You are mortals, scattered widely.
And one of His signs is this that He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest in them, and He put between you love and compassion; herein, indeed, are signs for a people who reflect.
And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your tongues and colours; herein, indeed are signs for the learned (men who have knowledge).
And one of His signs is your sleeping by night and your seeking of His Bounty (livelihood, benefits and treasures) by day; herein, indeed, are signs for a people who heed (pay attention, are aware or conscious).
And one of His signs is this, that He shows you the lightning for fear and for hope, and sends down water from the clouds thereby quickens the earth after its death; herein, indeed, are signs for a people who understand.
And one of His signs is this that the heaven and the earth subsist by His command, then when He calls you with a single call, lo! From out of the earth, you emerge.
And His is whoever is in the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to Him.
And He it is Who originates the creation, then reproduces it, and it is easy for Him; and His is the Sublime Similitude (or the most exalted attributes) in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
He sets forth to you a similitude (parable) relating to yourselves (and your own experience): Have you among those whom your right hands possess (slaves) partners in what We have given you for sustenance, to share as equals; do you fear them as you fear each other? Thus do We make the revelation clear for a people who understand.
Nay! Those who are unjust follow their low desires without any knowledge; so who can guide him whom Allah causes to err? And they shall have no helpers.
Then set your purpose for religion as a man upright by nature - the nature made by Allah in which He has made men; there is no altering (the laws of) Allah's creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know -
Turning to Him only, and be careful of your duty to Him and keep up prayer and be not of those who ascribe partners to Him (polytheists),
Of those who split their religion and became schismatic, every sect rejoicing in its own tenets.
And when harm afflicts men, they call upon their Lord, turning to Him, then when He makes them taste of mercy from Him, lo! Some of them begin to associate (others) with their Lord,
So as to be ungrateful for what We have given them; (unto such it is said) "Enjoy yourselves for a while, for you shall soon come to know (the truth)".
Or, have We sent down upon them an authority so that it speaks of that which they associate with Him?
And when We make people taste of mercy they rejoice in it, and if an evil befall them for what their hands have already wrought, lo! They are in despair.
Do they not see that Allah makes ample provision for whom He pleases, or restricts it? Herein, indeed, are signs for a people who believe.
Then give to the near of kin his due, and to the needy and the wayfarer; this is best for those who desire Allah's countenance (presence, pleasure), and these it is who are successful.
And whatever you lay out as usury, so that it may increase in the property of men, it has no increase with Allah; but that which you give in charity, desiring Allah's countenance (presence, pleasure) has increase manifold.
Allah is He Who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He causes you to die, then brings you to life. Is there any of your associate-gods who does aught of it? Glory be to Him, and exalted be He above what they associate (with Him).
Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea on account of what the hands of men have wrought, that He may make them taste a part of that which they have done, so that they may return.
Say: Travel in the land, then see how was the end of those before you; most of them were idolaters.
So set your purpose resolutely to the right religion, before there come from Allah the day which cannot be averted (or is inevitable). On that day they will be sundered.
Whoever disbelieves, must bear the consequences for his disbelief, and whoever does good makes provision for his own soul,
That He may reward those who believe and do good out of His Bounty; surely He loves not the disbelievers.
And one of His signs is this, that He sends forth the winds bearing good news, and that He may make you taste of His mercy, and that the ships may run by His command, and that you may seek of His favour, and that you may be grateful.
Verily We sent before you messengers to their own people. They came to them with clear arguments. Then We gave the punishment to those who were guilty; and helping believers is ever incumbent on Us.
Allah is he Who sends forth the winds so they raise a cloud, then He spreads it forth in the sky as He pleases, and He breaks it up so that you see the rain coming forth from within it; then when He causes it to fall upon whom He pleases of His servants, lo! They rejoice;
Though they were before this, even before it was sent down upon them, in sure despair.
Look then at the signs of Allah's mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death; most surely He will raise the dead to life; and He has power over all things.
And if We send a wind and they see it to yellow (scorch the crop), they would after that certainly continue in their disbelief.
For surely you can not make the dead to hear and you can not make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned away (or their backs to flee).
Nor can you lead away the blind out of their error. you can not make to hear any but those who believe in Our revelations so that they Surrender (in Islam).
Allah is He Who created you from a state of weakness then He gave strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and grey hair after strength. He creates what He will, and He is the Knower, the Mighty.
And on the day when the Hour shall come, the guilty shall swear that they did not tarry but an hour - thus are they ever deceived.
And those who are given knowledge and faith will say, "Certainly (indeed, in truth) you tarried according to the ordinance of Allah till the Day of Resurrection, so this is the Day of Resurrection, but you were not aware."
But on that day their excuse shall not profit those who were unjust, nor shall they be allowed to make amends.
Verily, We have set forth for men every kind of similitude (parable, example) in this Quran; and, indeed, if you should bring them a miracle, those who disbelieve would certainly say: You are naught but false claimants.
Thus does Allah set a seal on the heart of those who know not.
Therefore be patient; surely the promise of Allah is true and let not those who have no certainty of faith shake your firmness. 
ALIF LAM MIM.
These are the verses (revelations) of the Wise Book,
A guidance and a mercy to those who do good,
Those who establish regular prayer and give charity, and who are sure of the Hereafter;
These are in true guidance from their Lord, and these are the Successful.
But amongst men are those who purchase (pay for) idle tales without knowledge (or meaning), to lead astray men from the path of Allah, and to make a jest of it; for them is shameful woe! 
And when Our signs are recited to such a one, he turns away in arrogance as though he heard them not, as if there was deafness in both his ears. Announce to him a grievous penalty.
Verily, those who believe and do right, for them are Gardens of Bliss,
Wherein they will abide; it is a promise of Allah in truth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
He created the heavens without supports that you can see, and He placed upon the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with you; and He dispersed therein all kinds of beasts; and We send down from the heavens water, and We caused plants of every noble kind to grow therein.
This is the Creation of Allah; show me that which others beside Him have created. Nay, the unjust are in obvious error.
Verily, We did give unto Luqman wisdom, saying, "Thank Allah; for he who thanks Allah is only thankful for his own soul; and he who is ungrateful - verily, Allah is Absolute (Independent, Self-sufficient), Owner of all praise."
And (remember) when Luqman said to his son while admonishing him, "O my boy! Associate none with Allah, for, verily, such association is a mighty wrong."-
For We have commended his parents to men - his mother bore him with travail upon travail; and it took two years to wean him - "Be thankful to Me and to your parents; for unto Me is the journeying.
"But if they strive with you to make you ascribe unto Me partners of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Consort with them in the world with kindness, and follow the way of him who turns repentant unto Me. Then unto Me is your return, and I will inform you of that which you used to do.
(Said Luqman) "O my dear son! Verily, if there were the weight of a grain of mustard seed and it were hidden in the rock, or in the heaven, or in the earth, Allah would bring it forth. Verily, Allah is Subtle, Aware.
"O my dear son! Establish worship, and enjoin what is just and forbid iniquity; be patient (constant) whatever befalls you, verily, that is of the steadfast heart of affairs.
"And twist not your cheek in scorn towards folk, nor walk haughtily (or insolently) in the land; verily, Allah loves not any arrogant boaster: 
"But be modest in your bearing and subdue your voice; lo! The harshest of all voices is the voice of the ass."
Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and has poured down upon you His favours, outwardly and inwardly? But amongst men are those who wrangle about Allah, without knowledge, and without guidance, and without an illuminating book (Scriptures that gives light and enlightens).
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has sent down;" they say, "Nay! We will follow wherein we found our fathers." - What! Even if Satan calls them to the torment of the blaze?
But he who Surrenders his purpose unto Allah (i.e. becomes a Muslim), and does good, he has grasped the firm handle; with Allah rests the issue of all affairs. 
But he who disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you; to Us is their return, and We will inform them of what they did; for, verily, Allah is aware of what is in the heart of men.
We will let them enjoy themselves a little; then We will force them to the unrelenting doom.
And if you should ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely say, "Allah." Say, "Praise be to Allah!" but most of them know not.
Unto Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth; verily, Allah, He is the Absolute, the Owner of praise.
And were the trees that are in the earth pens, and the sea ink with seven more seas to swell it, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted; verily, Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Your creation and your rising again are but as that of a single soul; verily, Allah is Hearer, Seer.
Have you not seen that Allah joins the night to the day, and joins the day to the night, and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running unto an appointed time? And that Allah is well informed of what you do?
That is because Allah, He is Truth (or the only Reality), and because what you call on beside Him is the False, and because Allah, He is the Sublime, the Great.
Do you not see that the ship rides on in the sea by the favour of Allah, that He may show you of His wonders? Verily, in that are signs to every grateful heart.
And when a wave like a shadow covers them, they call on Allah, being sincere in their religion; and when He saves them to the shore, then amongst them are some who halt between two opinions. But none denies Our signs save every perfidious disbeliever.
O mankind! Fear (keep your duty to) your Lord and dread the Day when the parent shall not be able to avail the child in aught, nor shall the child avail aught for its parent. Lo! the promise of Allah is true! Say, "Let not the life of this world beguile you; nor let not the Chief Deceiver beguile you concerning Allah.
Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour; He sends down the rain; and He knows that which is in the wombs. No soul knows what it is that it shall earn to-morrow; and no soul knows in what land it will die. Verily, Allah is Knower, Aware.
 32:1 Alif Lam Mim.
The revelation of the Book, wherein there is no doubt, is from the Lord of the Worlds.
Or do they say, "He (Muhammad) has invented it? Nay! It is the truth from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no Warner has come before you, that they may follow the right direction.
Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six Days (periods), and He mounted the Throne (of authority); you have not besides Him any guardian or any intercessor, will you not then remember?
He directs the ordinance (regulates all affairs) from the heaven to the earth; then shall it ascend to Him in a Day the measure of which is a thousand years of what you count.
This is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty the Merciful,
Who made good everything that He has created, and He began the creation of man from dust.
Then He made his progeny of an extract, of a fluid held in low esteem.
Then He fashioned him and breathed into him of His spirit, and made for you the faculties of hearing, and sight and heart; little is it that you give thanks.
And they say: What! When we have become lost in the earth, shall we then certainly be a new creation? Nay! They are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.
Say: The angel of death who is given charge of you shall cause you to die, then to your Lord you shall be returned.
And could you but see when the guilty shall hang down their heads before their Lord: (saying) "Our Lord! We have seen and we have heard, therefore send us back, we will work righteousness; surely (now) we are certain."
And if We had pleased We would certainly have given to every soul its guidance, but the word (which had gone forth about evil-doers) from Me was just this: "I will certainly fill hell with the jinn and men together."
So taste (the evil of your deeds), because you neglected the meeting of this day of yours; surely We forsake you; and taste the abiding chastisement for what you used to do.
Only they believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate (in obeisance) and celebrate the praise of their Lord, and they are not proud.
Their sides draw away from their beds, they call upon their Lord in fear and in hope, and they spend (benevolently) out of what We have given them.
No soul knows what is hidden for them of that which will refresh the eyes (give them joy); a reward for what they did.
Is he then who is a believer like him who is an evil-liver (transgressor)? They are not alike (equal).
As for those who believe and do good, the Gardens are their homes - a hospitable welcome for what they did.
And as for those who transgress, their abode is the Fire; whenever they desire to go forth from it they shall be brought back into it, and it will be said to them, "Taste the chastisement of the fire which you called a lie."
And most certainly We will make them taste of the Lesser (or Nearer) Chastisement (i.e. in this life) before the Greater Chastisement (in the Hereafter) that per chance (or possibly) they may turn.
And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord, then he turns away from them? Surely We will requite the guilty.
And certainly We gave the Book to Moses, so be not in doubt concerning the receiving of it, and We made it a guide for the children of Israel.
And We made of them Imams (religious or spiritual leaders) to guide by Our command when they were patient, and they were certain of Our revelations.
Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ.
Does it not point out to them the right way, how many of the generations, in whose abodes they go about, did We destroy before them? Most surely there are signs in this; will they not then hear?
Do they not see that We drive the water to a land having no herbage, then We bring forth thereby crops of which their cattle and they themselves eat; will they not then see?
And they ask: "When will this judgment take place, if you are truthful?"
Say: "On the Day of Judgment the faith of those who (now) disbelieve will not profit them, nor will they be reprieved."
Therefore turn away from them and wait: surely they too are waiting.
O Prophet! Be careful of (your duty to) Allah and do not comply with the wishes of the disbelievers and the hypocrites; surely Allah is Knower, Wise;
And follow that which is inspired (revealed) to you from your Lord; surely Allah is Aware of what you do;
And rely on (or trust in) Allah; and Allah is sufficient for a Protector.
Allah has not made for any man two heart within him; nor has He made your wives, whose backs you liken to the backs of your mothers (whom you have divorced) as your mothers, nor has He made those whom you assert to be your sons your real sons; these are the words of your mouths; and Allah speaks the truth and He guides to the (straight) way.
Proclaim their real relationship to their fathers; this is more equitable with Allah; but if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brethren in faith and your friends; and there is no blame on you concerning that in which you make mistakes, but only in that which your heart do purposely, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Prophet is closer to (has a greater claim on) the faithful than they have on themselves, and his wives are (as) their mothers; and the possessors of (genetic) relationship have the better claim in the ordinance of Allah to inheritance, one with respect to another, than other believers, and Muhajir (those who fled from Mecca), except that you do some good to your friends; this is written in the Book 
And when We made a covenant with the prophets and with you (Muhammad), and with Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, son of Mary, We made with them a strong (solemn) covenant,
That He may question the Custodians of Truth about the truth (or the Loyal about loyalty), and He has prepared for the unfaithful a painful doom.
O you who believe! Call to mind the favour of Allah to you when there came down upon you hosts, so We sent against them a strong wind and hosts that you saw not, and Allah is Seer what you do.
When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when the eyes turned dull, and the heart rose up to the throats, and you began to think vain thoughts of Allah. 
There the believers were sorely tried and they were shaken with severe shaking.
And when the hypocrites and those in whose heart was a disease began to say, "Allah and His Apostle did not promise us nothing but delusion."
And when a party of them said, "O people of Yathrib! there is no place to stand for you (here), therefore go back"; and a party of them asked permission of the Prophet, saying. "Surely our houses are exposed"; and they were not exposed; they only desired to flee.
And if the enemy had entered upon them from the outlying parts of it, and they had been exhorted to treachery, they would certainly have done it, and they would have hesitated but little.
And certainly they had made a covenant with Allah before, that they would not turn their backs; and Allah's covenant shall be answered for.
Say, "Flight shall not avail you if you flee from death or slaughter, and then you dwell in comfort but a little."
Say, " Who is it that can withhold you from Allah if He intends to do you harm, or He intends to show you mercy? And they will not find for themselves besides Allah any friend or helper."
Allah knows indeed those among you who hinder others and those who say to their brethren, "Come to us"; and they come not to the fight but a little,
Being niggardly in their help to you; but when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes rolling like one swooning unto death; but when the fear is gone they smite you with sharp tongues, being covetous of the goods (spoils of war). These have not believed. Therefore Allah has made their deeds ineffective (vain, fruitless); and this is easy for Allah.
They think the confederates (enemy clans) have not gone, and if the confederates should come (again) they would fain be in the deserts with the wandering Arabs (Bedouins) asking for news about you, and if they were among you they would not fight save a little.
Verily, you have in the Messenger of Allah an excellent example for him who hopes in Allah and the Last Day and remembers Allah much.
And when the believers saw the Confederates, they said, "This is what Allah and His Apostle promised us, and Allah and His Apostle spoke the truth"; and it only increased them in faith and surrender (or obedience).
Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant which they made with Allah: so of them is he who accomplished his vow, and of them is he who yet waits, and they have not changed in the least.
That Allah may reward the truthful for their truth, and punish the hypocrites if He please or relent towards them (mercifully); surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And Allah turned back the disbelievers in their rage; they did not obtain any advantage, and Allah sufficed the believers in their fight. Allah is Strong, Mighty.
And He brought down those of the People of the Book (Jews) who supported them, from their fortresses and He cast panic into their heart; some you killed and some you took captive.
And He made you heirs to their land and their dwellings and their property, and to a land which you have not yet trodden, and Allah has power over all things. 
O Prophet! Say to your wives, "If you desire this world's life and its adornment, then come, I will give you a provision and allow you to depart in a goodly manner.
"And if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then surely Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a mighty reward."
O wives of the prophet! Whoever of you commits an open indecency, the punishment shall be increased to her doubly; and this is easy to Allah.
And whoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Messenger and does good, We will give to her a double reward, and We have prepared for her an honourable sustenance.
O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women; If you will be on your guard, then be not soft in your speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease yearn for you; and utter goodly (just, polite) speech.
And stay in your houses and do not display your finery like the displaying of the ignorance of yore; and keep up prayer, and pay the poor-rate, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only desires to keep away uncleanness from you, O people of the Household and to purify you with a thorough purifying.
And keep in mind what is recited in your houses of the revelations of Allah and the wisdom. Verily, Allah is Subtile, Aware.
Verily, men who surrender and the women who surrender, and the believing men and the believing women, and the obeying men and the obeying women, and the truthful men and the truthful women, and the patient men and the patient women and the humble men and the humble women, and the charitable men and the charitable women, and the fasting men and the fasting women, and the men who guard their modesty and the women who guard (their modesty), and the men who remember Allah much and the women who remember - Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a mighty reward.
And it behoves not a believing man and a believing woman that they should have any choice in their matter when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he surely goes astray in manifest error.
And when you said to him to whom Allah had shown favour and to whom you had shown a favour, "Keep your wife to yourself and be careful of (your duty to) Allah"; and you concealed in your soul what Allah would bring to light, and you feared men, whereas Allah had a greater right that you should fear Him. But when Zaid had accomplished the necessary formalities (of divorce) from her, We gave her to you (Muhammad) as a wife, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished the formalities of divorce from them. The commands of Allah shall be performed (fulfiled).
There is no harm in the Prophet doing that which Allah has ordained for him; such has been the course of Allah with respect to those who have gone before; and the command of Allah is a decree that is made absolute:
Those who deliver the messages of Allah and fear Him, and do not fear any one but Allah; and Allah is sufficient to take account.
Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Last of the prophets; and Allah is Aware of all things.
O you who believe! Remember Allah, remembering frequently,
And glorify Him morning and evening.
He it is Who sends His blessings on you, and so do His angels, that He may bring you forth out of utter darkness into the light; and He is Merciful to the believers.
Their salutation on the day that they meet Him shall be, "Peace", and He has prepared for them an honourable reward.
O Prophet! Surely We have sent you as a witness, and as a bearer of good news and as a Warner,
And as one inviting to Allah by His permission, and as a light-giving Lamp.
And give to the believers the good news that they shall have a great bounty from Allah.
And incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard their annoying talk, and rely on Allah; and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee.
O you who believe! When you marry the believing women, and then divorce them before you touch them, then you have in their case no term (of waiting) to reckon; so make some provision for them and send them forth in a goodly manner.
O Prophet! Surely We have made lawful to you your wives whom you have given their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses out of those whom Allah has given to you as prisoners of war, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who fled with you; and a believing woman if she gave herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desired to marry her especially for you, not for the rest of believers; We know what We have ordained for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess in order that no blame may attach to you; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
You may put off whom you please of them, and you may take to you whom you please, and whom you desire of those whom you had separated provisionally; no blame attaches to you; this is most proper, so that their eyes may be cool and they may not grieve, and that they should be pleased, all of them with what you give them, and Allah knows what is in your heart; and Allah is Knowing, Forbearing.
It is not lawful to you to marry more women afterwards, nor that you should change them for other wives, though their beauty be pleasing to you, except what your right hand possesses and Allah is Watchful over all things.
O you who believe! Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a meal without waiting for the proper time, unless permission is given to you. But if you are invited, enter, and when the meal is ended, then disperse. Linger not for vain conversation; surely this gives the Prophet trouble, but he forbears from you, and Allah does not forbear from the truth. And when you ask of them (the wives) anything, ask of them from behind a curtain; this is purer for your heart and for their heart; and it does not behove you that you should cause annoyance to the Messenger of Allah, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him. Verily, this is grievous in the sight of Allah.
If you do a thing openly or do it in secret, then surely Allah is Aware of all things.
There is no blame on them in respect of their fathers, nor their brothers, nor their brothers' sons, nor their sisters' sons nor their own women, nor of what their right hands possess; and be careful of your duty to Allah; surely Allah is a witness of all things.
Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! Call for Divine blessings on him and salute him with a becoming salutation.
Surely, those who speak evil things of Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter, and He has prepared for them a humiliating chastisement.
And those who speak evil things of the believing men and the believing women undeservedly, they are guilty indeed of a false accusation and a manifest sin.
O Prophet! Say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their over-garments (cloaks); this will be more proper, that they may be known, and not be molested; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
If the hypocrites and those in whose heart is a disease and the agitators in the city do not desist, We shall most certainly set you over them, then they shall not be your neighbours in it but for a little while;
Cursed: wherever they are found they shall be seized and slain without mercy.
(Such has been) the course of Allah with respect to those who have gone before; and you shall not find any change in the course of Allah.
Men ask you about the hour; say, “The knowledge of it is only with Allah, and what will make you understand?” - The Hour may be nigh.
Surely Allah has cursed the disbelievers and has prepared for them a blazing Fire,
Wherein they will abide forever (or a long time); they shall find no protecting friend or helper.
On the day when their faces shall be turned back into the fire, they shall say, "O would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!"
And they shall say, "O our Lord! Surely we obeyed our leaders and our great men, so they led us astray from the path;
"O our Lord! Give them a double punishment and curse them with a great curse."
O you who believe! Be not like those who spoke evil things of Moses, but Allah cleared him of what they said, and he was worthy of regard with Allah.
O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah and speak straight to the point.
He will put your deeds into a right state (correctly adjust, harmonise, make whole) for you, and forgive you your faults; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he indeed achieves a mighty success.
Verily, We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to undertake it, being afraid of it; but man undertook it. Lo! He has proved a tyrant and a fool.
So Allah will chastise the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, and Allah will turn to (forgive and help) the believing men and women, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
All praise is due to Allah, unto Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and His is the praise in the Hereafter; and He is the Wise, the Aware.
He knows that which goes down into the earth and that which comes out of it, and that which comes down from the heaven and that which goes up to it; and He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.
And those who disbelieve say, "The hour shall not come upon us." Say, "Yea! By my Lord, the Knower of the Unseen, it shall certainly come upon you; not the weight of an atom becomes absent from Him, in the heavens or in the earth, and neither less than that nor greater, but all is in a Clear Record.
"That He may reward those who believe and do good; these it is for whom is forgiveness and a most generous sustenance."
And those who strive hard in opposing Our revelations, these it is for whom is a painful and humiliating chastisement.
And those to whom knowledge has been given see that which has been revealed unto you from your Lord, that it is the truth, and it guides into the path of the Mighty, the Owner of Praise. 
And those who disbelieve say, "Shall we point out to you a man who informs you that when you have disintegrated into dust and become scattered, even then you shall be created anew?
"He has forged a lie against Allah or there is madness in him. "Nay! Those who do not believe in the Hereafter are in torment and in great error.
Do they not then consider what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth? If We will We can make them disappear in the land or bring down upon them a portion from the heaven; most surely in this is a sign for every servant who turns to Allah repentant.
And certainly We gave David grace from Us, saying, "O mountains! Echo his psalms of praise with him, and you birds also; and We made the iron pliant unto him,
Saying, "Make ample (coats of mail), and measure (balance well) the links, and do right; surely I am Seer of what you do.
And We made the wind (subservient) unto Solomon, which made a month's journey in the morning and a month's journey in the evening, and We made a fountain of molten copper to flow out for him, and of the Jinn (foreigners or ingenious skilled workers?) there were those who worked before him by the command of his Lord; and whoever turned aside from Our command from among them, We made him taste of the punishment of flaming Fire.
They made for him what he pleased of temples and images, and bowls (large) as watering-troughs and cooking-pots that will not move from their place; give thanks, O family of David! Few of My servants are grateful!
But when We decreed death for him, naught showed them his death but a creature of the earth that ate away his staff; and when he fell down, the Jinn came to know plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have continued in abasing toil.
Certainly there was a sign for Sheba in their abode; two gardens on the right and the left; (as if to say) "Eat of the provisions of your Lord and give thanks to Him - a good land and an Indulgent Lord!"
But they turned away, so We sent upon them a flood from Dams, and We converted their two gardens into two gardens yielding bitter fruit and tamarisk and a few lote-trees.
We requited them with this because they were ungrateful; do We ever punish any but the ungrateful?
And We set between them and the towns which We had blessed, other towns to be easily seen (in prominent positions), and for the journey between then We appointed proportional stages, (saying) "Travel through them secure by nights and days."
And they said, "O our Lord! Make the spaces longer between our journeys.". They were unjust to themselves (wronged themselves) so We made them as stories (by words, legends) and dispersed them with an utter scattering; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one.
And certainly Satan found true his calculations concerning them, so they follow him, except a party of the believers.
And he has no authority over them, but that We may distinguish him who believes in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt concerning it; and your Lord is the Watcher (Preserver) of all things.
Say, "Call upon those whom you assert (or set up) besides Allah; they do not control the weight of an atom in the heavens or in the earth nor have they any partnership in either, nor has He among them any one to help Him.
"And intercession will not avail at all with Him save of him whom He permits. Until when fear shall be removed from their heart, they shall say, 'What is it that your Lord said?' They shall say, 'The truth.' And He is the Most High, the Most Great."
Say, "Who gives you the sustenance from the heavens and the earth?" Say, "It is Allah. And most surely we or you are on a right way or in manifest error!"
Say, "You will not be questioned as to what we are guilty of, nor shall we be questioned as to what you do."
Say, "Our Lord will gather us together, then will He judge between us with the truth; and He is the greatest Judge, the All-knowing."
Say, "Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners; by no means (can you do it). Nay! He is Allah, the Mighty, the Wise."
And We have not sent you (Muhammad) but to all mankind (or as a Universal Messenger) as a bearer of good news and as a Warner, but most men know not.
And they say, "When will this promise be (fulfiled) if you are truthful?"
Say, "You have the appointment of a Day which you cannot hold back for an hour, nor can you bring it forward."
And those who disbelieve say, "By no means will we believe in this Quran, nor in that which is before it "Could you but see when the unjust shall be made to stand before their Lord, casting blame one another! Those who were reckoned weak (or despised) shall say to those who were proud, "Had it not been for you we would certainly have been believers.”
Those who were proud shall say to those who were deemed weak (or despised), "Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had come to you? Nay, you (yourselves) were guilty."
And those who were deemed weak (despised) shall say to those who were proud, "Nay, it was your scheming night and day when you told us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up rivals with Him." And they shall declare repentance when they see the penalty; and We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved; they shall only be requited for what they did.
And We never sent a Warner to a town but those who led lives in ease in it said, "We are surely disbelievers in what you are sent with.
And they say, "We have more wealth and children, and we shall not be punished."
Say, "Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and restricts it (for whom He pleases), but most men know not."
It is not your wealth nor your children which bring you near Us in station, but whoever believes and does good, these it is for whom is a double reward for what they do, and they shall be secure in the highest places.
And as for those who strive in opposing Our revelations, they shall be brought to the chastisement.
Say, "Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants and restricts them (for whom He wills). And whatever you spend, He replaces it, and He is the best of Providers.
And on the Day when He will gather them all together, then will He say to the angels, "Did these people worship you?"
They shall say, "Glory be to Thee! Thou art our Guardian, not they; nay! they worshipped the Jinn; most of them were believers in them."
So on that day one of you shall not control profit or harm for another, and We will say to those who were unjust, "Taste the chastisement of the Fire which you denied."
And when Our clear communications are recited to them, they say, "This is naught but a man who desires to turn you away from that which your fathers worshipped." And they say, "This is naught but a lie that is forged." And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it comes to them, "This is only clear enchantment (magic)."
And We have not given them (Arabs) any Books (Scripture) which they read, nor did We send to them before you a Warner. 
And those before them rejected the truth, and these have not yet attained a tenth of what We gave them, yet they rejected My messenger, how terrible, then, was My rejection (abhorrence of them)!
Say, "I exhort you only to one thing that you awake for Allah's sake (or stand up before Allah) in twos or singly, then ponder: there is no madness in your companion (or comrade, fellow-citizen); he is only a Warner to you before a severe doom.
Say, "I ask no reward for myself (Or whatever reward I have asked of you, is yours or is only for yourselves); my reward is only with Allah, and He is a witness of all things."
Say, "Surely my Lord utters the truth (or castes the truth (over His servants)), He is the Knower of the unseen (or hidden)."
Say, "The truth has come, and the falsehood shall vanish and shall not return (or falsehood neither creates nor restores)."
Say, " If I err, I err only against my own soul, and if I follow a right direction, it is because of what my Lord reveals to me; surely He is Hearing, Nigh.
Could you but see when they are terrified with no escape and are seized upon from near at hand.
And they shall say, "We believe in it (now)." But how can they reach faith from a position so far away from it?
(Seeing) they disbelieved in it before. And they aim at the unseen from afar off (with far out conjectures)
And a barrier shall be placed between them and that which they desire, as was done with the likes of them before: surely they are in hopeless (disquieting, distressing) doubt.
All praise is due to Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Maker of the angels, messengers flying on wings, two, and three, and four (pairs); He increases in creation what He pleases; surely Allah has power over all things.
Whatever Allah grants to men of His mercy, there is none to withhold it, and what He withholds there is none to send it forth after that, and He is the Mighty, the Wise
O men! Call to mind the favour of Allah on you; is there any creator besides Allah who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth? There is no God but He; whither are you then turned?
And if they call you a liar, truly messengers before you were called liars, and to Allah are all affairs returned.
O men! Surely the promise of Allah is true, therefore let not the life of this world deceive you, and let not the arch deceiver deceive you respecting Allah.
Surely Satan is your enemy, so take him for an enemy; he only invites his party to be inmates of the flaming Fire.
 35:7 As for those who disbelieve, they shall have a severe punishment, and as for those who believe and do good, they shall have forgiveness and a great reward.
What! Is he whose evil deed is made fair-seeming to him so that he considers it good (other than Satan's dupe)? Now surely Allah sends astray whom He will and guides aright whom He will, so let not your soul waste away in grief (expire in sighing) for them; surely Allah is Aware of what they do.
And Allah is He Who sends the winds so they raise a cloud, then We drive it on to a dead country, and therewith We give life to the earth after its death; even so is the Resurrection.
Whoever desires power (or honour), then to Allah belongs the power (or honour) wholly. Unto Him do ascend good words, and good deeds does He exalt; and as for those who plan evil deeds, they shall have a severe chastisement; and their plans shall fail.
And Allah created you of dust, then of the life-germ, then He made you pairs; and no female bears, nor does she bring forth, except with His knowledge; and no one whose life is lengthened has his life lengthened, nor is aught diminished of one's life, but it is all recorded in a Book; surely this is easy for Allah.
And the two seas are not alike: the one fresh, sweet, pleasant to drink; and the other salt, that burns by its saltiness; yet from each of them you eat fresh flesh and bring forth ornaments which you wear; and you see the ships cleave through it that you may seek of His bounty and that you maybe grateful.
He causes the night to enter in upon the day, and He causes the day to enter in upon the night, and He has made subservient the sun and the moon; each one follows its course to an appointed time; this is Allah, your Lord, His is the kingdom; and those whom you call upon besides Him do not control as much as a spot on a date stone.
If you call on them they shall not hear your call, and even if they could hear they shall not answer you; and on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your associating them (with Allah); and none can inform you like the One Who is Aware.
O men! You are they who are poor (stand in need of Allah), and Allah is He Who is the Self-sufficient (Absolute), the Owner of Praise. 
If He will, He can remove you, and bring, instead a new creation.
And this is not hard for Allah.
And no burdened soul can bear the burden of another and if one weighed down by burden should cry (for help) to another, not aught of it shall be lifted, even though he be near of kin. You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer; and whoever purifies himself, he purifies himself only for (the good of) his own soul; and to Allah is the journeying.
And the blind and the seeing are not alike 
Nor the darkness and the light,
Nor the shade and the heat,
Neither are the living and the dead alike. Surely Allah makes whom He pleases hear, and you cannot make those hear who are in the graves.
You  (Muhammad) are naught but a Warner.
Surely We have sent you (Muhammad) with the truth as a bearer of good news and a Warner; and there is not a people but a Warner has gone among them.
And if they call you a liar, so did, indeed, those before them (call their messengers a liar); their Messengers had come to them with clear arguments, and with scriptures, and with the illuminating book.
Then did I punish those who disbelieved, so how intense was My disapproval?
Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud, then We bring forth therewith fruits of various colours; and in the mountains are streaks, white and red, of various hues and (others) intensely black?
And of men and beasts and cattle are likewise of various hues (or species). Only those of His servants who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah alone; surely Allah is Mighty, Forgiving.
Surely they who recite the Book of Allah and keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and openly, hope for a gain which will not perish.
That He may pay them back fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace: surely He is Forgiving, Responsive (or Appreciative).
And that which We have revealed to you of the Book, that is the Truth, confirming (verifying) that which was revealed before it; verily, Allah is Aware, Seer of His servants.
Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from among Our servants; but of them is he who makes his soul to suffer a loss, and of them is he who takes a middle course, and of them is he who is foremost in deeds of goodness by Allah's permission; this is the great excellence.
Gardens of Eternity, they shall enter; they shall be made to wear therein bracelets of gold and pearls, and their dress therein shall be silk.
And they shall say: (All) praise is due to Allah, Who has made grief to depart from us; most surely our Lord is Forgiving, Bountiful.
Who has settled (established) us in Mansions of Eternity by His grace; toil touches us not therein, nor can fatigue afflict us.
And as for those who disbelieve, for them is the Fire of hell; it shall not finish them entirely so that they die, nor shall the chastisement thereof be lightened to them: even thus do We recompense every ungrateful one.
And they shall cry therein for succour, "O our Lord! Take us out, we will do good deeds, not the wrong which we used to do." Did We not preserve you alive long enough for him who reflected to reflect? And (also) Warners came to you; therefore taste (the flavour of your deeds), because for the unjust, there is no helper.
Verily, Allah is the Knower of what is unseen in the heavens and the earth; surely He is Aware of what is in the heart.
He it is Who made you regents (inheritors and vicegerents) in the land; therefore whoever disbelieves, his disbelief is against himself; and their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord in anything but hatred; and their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers in anything but loss.
Say, "Have you considered the associates which you call upon besides Allah? Show me what part of the earth they have created, or have they any share in the heavens; or, have We given them a book so that they follow a clear argument thereof? Nay, the unjust promise one to another only to deceive.
Surely Allah sustains the heavens and the earth lest they fail (deviate, collapse); and if they should fail, there is none who can uphold them after Him; surely He is the Forbearing, the Forgiving.
And they swore by Allah with the strongest of their oaths that if there came to them a Warner they would be better guided than any other nations; but when a Warner came to them, it increased them in nothing but aversion,
(Shown in their) behaving arrogantly in the land and in evil planning; and the evil plans beset none save the authors of it. Then should they wait for anything except the way of the former people? You will not find any alteration in the treatment of Allah; and you will not find any power to change the treatment of Allah.
Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the end of those before them while they were stronger than these in power? And Allah is not such that any thing in the heavens or in the earth should escape Him; surely He is Knowing, Powerful.
And were Allah to punish men for what they deserve, He would not leave any creature on the surface of the earth, but He reprieves them till an appointed term; so when their doom shall come, then surely Allah is Seer of His servants.
Ya Seen.
I swear by the Quran full of wisdom
Most surely you are one of the Messengers
On a Straight Way.
A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful.
That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, and so they are heedless.
Already has the word proved true of most of them, for they do not believe.
Surely We have placed chains on their necks, and these reach up to their chins, so they are stiff-necked.
And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them over so that they see not.
And it is alike to them whether you warn them or warn them not: they believe not.
You can only warn him who follows the Reminder (the Quran) and fears the Beneficent Allah in secret; so announce to him forgiveness and an honourable reward.
Surely We give life to the dead, and We write down what they have sent before and their footprints, and We have recorded everything in a Clear Record.
And set out to them a similitude: The 'Companions of the City', when the messengers came to it.
When We sent to them two, they rejected both of them, then We strengthened (them) with a third, and they said, "Surely we are messengers to you."
They said, "You are naught but mortals like ourselves, nor has the Beneficent Allah revealed anything; you only lie."
They said, "Our Lord knows that we are most surely messengers to you.
"And nothing devolves on us but a clear deliverance (of the message)."
They said, "Surely we augur (fear) evil from you; if you do not desist, we will certainly stone you, and there shall certainly afflict you a painful chastisement from us."
They said, "Your evil omen (expectation, foreboding) is with yourselves. What! Is it because you are reminded? Nay, you are a people that transgress all bounds."
And from the remote part of the city there came a man running, he said, "O my people! Follow the messengers;
"Follow him who does not ask you for reward, and who are the followers of the right course;
"And what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who brought me into existence? And to Him you shall be brought back;
"What! Shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession, if the Beneficent Allah should desire to afflict me with harm, shall not avail me aught, nor shall they be able to deliver me?
"Then truly I shall manifest (clear, obvious) error:
"Verily, I believe in your Lord, therefore hear me."
It was said (unto him), "Enter the garden." He said, "O would that my people knew
"Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honoured ones!"
And We sent not down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven, nor do We need to send.
It was naught but a single Shout, and lo! They were still and silenced (extinct).
Alas for the servants! There comes not to them a messenger but they mock at him.
Do they not consider how many of the generations have We destroyed before them, because they do not turn to them (the messengers) (or which return not unto the people)?
And all of them shall surely be brought before Us.
And a sign to them is the dead earth: We give life to it and bring forth from it grain so they eat of it.
And We make therein orchards of palms and grapevines and We make springs to flow forth in it, that they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands did not make it; will they not then be grateful?
Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things, of what the earth grows, and of their kind and of what they know not.
And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the day, then lo! They are in the dark;
And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing.
And as for the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an old dry palm leaf.
Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should overtake the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day; and all float on in their own orbits.
And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden vessels (or their race in an ark through the flood).
And We have created for them the like of it, in which they ride.
And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no helper for them, nor shall they be rescued.
Unless by mercy from Us and for enjoyment for a time.
And when it is said to them, "Guard against what is before you and what is behind you, that per chance (or possibly) you may find mercy.... (they are heedless)
And there comes not to them a sign from among the signs of their Lord but they turn away from it. 
And when it is said to them, "Spend of that which Allah has given you", those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Shall we feed him whom, if Allah please, He could feed? You are in naught but clear error."
And they say, "When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful?"
They wait not for aught but a single Shout (or Blast) which will surprise them while they yet dispute with one another.
So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families.
And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo! From their graves they shall hasten on to their Lord.
They shall say, "O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is what the Beneficent Allah promised and the messengers told the truth."
It will be naught but a single Shout (or Blast), when lo! They shall all be brought before Us;
So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which you did.
Surely the Companions of the Garden shall on that day be in happy occupation.
They and their wives (companions) shall be in shades, reclining on thrones of dignity.
They shall have fruits therein, and they shall have whatever they desire.
"Peace" - a word from a Merciful Lord.
"And get you hence this Day, O guilty ones!"
"Did I not charge you, O children of Adam! That you should not serve Satan? Verily, he is your open enemy,
"And that you should serve only Me; this is the Straight Way."
"And he certainly led astray a multitude of people from among you. What! Could you not then understand?
"This is the hell of which you were oft warned.
"Enter into it this day because you persisted in disbelief."
On that Day We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned.
And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes, then they would run about groping for the way, but how should they see?
And if We please We would surely transform them in their place, then they would not be able to go on, nor will they return (after error).
And whomsoever We cause to live long, We reduce him to an abject state in constitution; do they not then understand?
And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it meet for him; it is nothing but a reminder and a plain (clarifying) Quran,
That it may warn him who would have life, and that the word may prove true against the disbelievers.
Do they not see that We have created cattle for them, out of what Our hands have wrought, so they are their masters?
And We have subjected them to them, so some of them they have to ride upon, and some of them they have for food.
And therein they have advantages and drinks; will they not then be grateful?
And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be helped.
But they shall not be able to assist them, and they shall be a host brought up before them.
Therefore let not their speech grieve you; surely We know what they do in secret and what they do openly.
Does not man see that We have created him from a small seed? Then lo! He is an open disputant.
And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own creation. Says he, "Who will give life to the bones when they have decomposed?"
Say, "He will give life to them Who brought them into existence in the first place, and He is Knower of all (modes of) creation -
"He Who has made for you the fire from the green tree, so that with it you kindle (your own fire).
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yea! And He is the Creator (of all), the Knower.
His command, when He intends anything, is only to say to it, " Be", and it is.
Therefore glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and to Him you shall be brought back.
I swear by those who draw themselves out in ranks.
Then those who drive away (evil or the wicked) with reproof (or strength),
Then those who recite (proclaim), with mindfulness,
"Verily, verily your God is One:
"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the Easts (i.e. all the sun's rising point)."
Surely We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment, the stars,
And (there is) a safeguard against every rebellious Satan.
They cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are thrown at from every side,
Being driven off, and for them is a perpetual chastisement,
Except him who snatches a fragment by stealth, then there follows him a brightly shining flame.
Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or those (others) whom We have created. Surely We created them of plastic (malleable) clay.
Nay! You wonder while they mock,
And when they are reminded, they mind (heed) not,
And when they see a sign they incite one another to scoff,
And they say, "This is nothing but clear magic.
"What! When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then certainly be raised,
"Or our fathers of past times (ancestors)?"
Say, "Aye! And you shall be abject (humiliated)."
So it shall only be a single Shout, when lo! They shall see.
And they shall say, "O woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment."
(A voice will say,) "This is the Day of the Judgment which you called a lie.
"Gather together those who were unjust and their associates, and what they used to worship
"Besides Allah, then lead them to the way to hell.
"And stop them, for they must be questioned:
"What ails you that you do not help each other?"
Nay! On that day they shall be submissive.
And some of them shall advance towards others, questioning each other.
They shall say, "Surely you used to come to us from the right hand side."
They shall say, "Nay, you (yourselves) were not believers;
"And we had no authority over you, but you were a wayward people;
"So the sentence of our Lord has come to pass against us: we shall surely taste (punishment);
"We led you astray, for we were ourselves erring."
So they shall on that day be sharers in the chastisement one with another.
Surely thus do We deal with the guilty.
Surely they used to behave arrogantly when it was said to them, "There is no God but Allah."
And said, "What! Shall we indeed give up our gods for the sake of a mad poet?"
Nay, he has come with the truth and verified the (messages of) the Messengers sent before him.
Most surely you will taste the painful punishment.
And you shall not be punished except for what you did.
Save the servants of Allah, the purified ones.
For them is a determined sustenance,
Fruits, and they shall be highly honoured,
In Gardens of Felicity,
On Thrones (of Dignity), facing each other.
A bowl shall be made to go round them from water running out of clear springs,
Crystal-white, delicious to those who drink.
There shall be no distress in it, nor shall they be exhausted therewith.
And with them shall be those of modest gaze with large beautiful eyes;
As if they were delicate eggs carefully protected.
Then shall some of them turn to others, questioning each other.
A speaker from among them shall say, "Surely I had a comrade on earth,
"Who said, 'What! are you indeed of those who bear witness to (the truth)?
"'What! When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, indeed, be brought to judgment?'"
(A voice) Will say, "Will you look down?"
Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell.
He shall say (to the sceptic), "By Allah! You had almost caused me to perish;
"And had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought there.
"Is it then true that we shall not die,
"Except our previous death? And that we shall not be chastised?"
Most surely this is the supreme achievement.
For the like of this then let the workers work.
Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum (having bitter fruit)?
Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust.
Surely it is a tree that grows in the bottom of hell;
Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents (or devils).
Then verily, they shall eat of it and fill (their) bellies with it.
Then afterwards they shall drink a mixture prepared in boiling water.
Then most surely their return shall be to hell.
Certainly, they found their fathers going astray,
So in their footsteps they hasten on.
And certainly most of the ancients went astray before them,
And certainly We sent among them Warners.
Then see what was the end of those who were warned,
Except the servants of Allah, the purified ones.
And Noah did certainly call upon Us, and the most gracious of Hearer of prayer are We.
And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty distress.
And We made his offspring the survivors.
And We perpetuated to him praise among the later generations,
(This blessing) "Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations".
Thus do We surely reward the doers of good.
Surely he was of Our believing servants.
Then did We drown the others
And most surely Abraham followed his way.
When he came to his Lord with a whole (sound, pure) heart,
When he said to his father and his people, " What is it that you worship?"
"Is it lies - gods besides Allah - that you desire?
"What is then your idea about the Lord of the Worlds?"
Then he looked at the stars, looking up once,
Then he said, "Verily, I am sick (at heart of your worshipping these)."
So they turned their backs and went away.
Then he turned to their gods secretly and said, "What! Do you not eat?
"What is the matter with you that you do not speak?"
Then he attacked them, smiting them with his right hand.
So they (people) advanced towards him, hastening.
Said he, "Worship you what you yourselves carve out,
"When Allah has created you and what you make?"
They said, "Build for him a furnace, then cast him into the burning fire."
And they designed a plot against him, but We brought them low.
And he said, "Surely I flee to my lord; He will guide me.
"My Lord! Grant me those who do good deeds."
So We gave him the good news of a gentle son.
And when his son was old enough to work with him, he said, "O my son! Surely I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice you; consider then what do you think." He said. "O my father! Do what you are commanded; if Allah wills, you will find me of the patient (constant) ones.
So when they had both Surrendered (unto Allah in Islam) and he threw him down upon his face,
And We called out to him saying, "O Abraham!
You have indeed fulfiled the vision; surely thus do We reward the doers of good:
Most surely this is a manifest trial.
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice.
And We perpetuated to him among the later generations,
(This blessing) "Peace be on Abraham".
Thus do We reward the doers of good.
Surely he was one of Our believing servants.
And We gave him the good news of Isaac, a prophet among the righteous.
And We showered Our blessings on him and on Isaac; and of their offspring are some who do good, and also some who are clearly unjust to their own souls.
And certainly We conferred a favour on Moses and Aaron.
And We delivered them both and their people from the mighty distress.
And We helped them, so they became the victors.
And We gave them both the Book that clarifies.
And We guided them both on the Straight Way.
And We perpetuated to them among the later generations,
(This blessing) "Peace be on Moses and Aaron".
Even thus do We reward the doers of good.
Surely they were both of Our believing servants.
And Elias was most surely one of those sent.
When he said to his people, "Do you not guard (against evil)?
"What! Do you call upon Baal and forsake the best of Creators,
"Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of past times (ancestors)?"
But they called him a liar, therefore they shall most surely be brought forth (to the doom).
But not the servants of Allah, the purified ones.
And We perpetuated to him among the later generations,
(This blessing) "Peace be on Elias".
Even thus do We reward the doers of good.
Surely he was one of Our believing servants.
And Lot was most surely one of those sent.
When We delivered him and his followers, everyone 
Except an old woman who was amongst those who lingered behind.
Then We destroyed the others.
And most surely you pass by their (ruins) in the morning,
And at night; do you not then understand?
And Jonah was most surely of those sent.
When he ran away to a ship completely laden,
Then he drew lots, but was of those rejected.
And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy,
But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us),
He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised.
Then We cast him on to the desert shore while he was sick.
And We caused a gourd plant to grow above him.
And We sent him to a hundred thousand folk or more.
And they believed; therefore, We gave them provision for a time.
Now ask them (O Muhammad) has your Lord daughters while they have sons?
Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?
Verily, it is of their own lies that they say,
"Allah has begotten"; and most surely they are liars.
Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons?
What ails you, how is it that you judge?
Will you not then reflect?
Or have you a clear authority?
Then bring your book (writ, record), if you are truthful.
And they assert a relationship between Him and the Jinn; and certainly the Jinn do know that they shall surely be brought forth;
Glory be to Allah from all that they attribute (unto Him);
But not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones.
So surely you and what you worship,
Cannot lead into temptation anyone against Him,
Save him who will go to hell.
(The angels or those who are ranged in ranks say,) "And there is none of us but has an assigned place,
"Verily, we, even we, are they who draw out in ranks,
"Verily, we, even we, are they who declare the glory (of Allah)."
And there are those who used to say,
"Had we a reminder from those of yore,
"We would certainly have been the single-minded servants of Allah.
But (now that it is come) they disbelieve in it; but they will come to know.
And certainly Our word has already gone forth before this unto Our servants sent
That most surely they shall be helped
And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones.
Therefore, turn away from them till a time,
And watch, for they will soon come to see.
What! Would they then hasten Our chastisement?
But when it descends on them, evil will then be the morning for those who have been warned.
And turn away from them for a time
And watch, for they will soon come to see.
Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of Majesty, above all that which they attribute (unto Him).
And peace be unto those who are sent.
And all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
Sad. (I swear) By the Quran, full of Zikr (remembrance in reverence and praising Allah, admonition, reciting, teaching, giving the message).
Nay! But those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation (pride) and separatism (schism).
How many generations did We destroy before them, then they cried when there was no longer time to escape.
And they marvel that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves, and the disbelievers say: "This is an enchanter, a liar".
What! Makes he a single God out of the many gods? A strange thing is this, to be sure!
And the leaders among them go about exhorting, "Go and remain constant to your gods; for this is most surely a thing designed against you.
"We never heard of this in the former faith; this is nothing but an invention.
"Has the reminder been revealed to him alone from among us?" Nay! They are in doubt as to My reminder. Nay! They have not yet tasted My chastisement!
Or is it that they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower?
Or is it that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? Then let them ascend by ropes 
But there they shall be put to flight, even as a confederated host.
The people of Noah before them denied the messengers and so did the people of A'ad, and Pharaoh, the Lord of Stakes (of stability). 
And the people of Thamud and the people of Lot and the Companions of the Woods; these were the factions.
There was none of them but denied the messengers, therefore, just was My retribution.
These wait aught but a single Shout, which brooks no delay.
And they say, "Our Lord! Hasten on to us our portion before the Day of Reckoning."
Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant David, the possessor of power; surely he was frequent in turning (to Allah).
Surely We made the mountains sing the glory (of Allah) in unison with him at nightfall and sunrise,
And the birds gathered together; all joined in singing with him.
And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment.
And has there come to you the story of the Disputants (litigants), when they made an entry into the private chamber by ascending over the walls?
When they entered in upon David and he was frightened by them, they said, "Fear not; we are two litigants, of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide between us with justice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the right (fair, even) way.
"Lo! This is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have but one; but he said, 'Give to me', and he has prevailed against me in discourse."
He said, "Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own ewes. Lo! Many partners act wrongfully towards one another, except those who believe and do good, and very few are they." And David was sure that We had tried him. So he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned in repentance (to Him).
Therefore, We rectified for him this lapse, and most surely he had nearness to Us and an excellent journey's end (return).
"O David! Surely We have made you a Vicegerent in the land; so judge between men with justice and follow not desire, lest it should lead you astray from the path of Allah. Lo! Those who go astray from the path of Allah, they shall surely have a severe punishment because they forgot the Day of Reckoning."
And We create not the heaven and the earth and that which is between them in vain; that is the opinion of those who disbelieve; then woe to those who disbelieve because of the Fire.
Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the mischief-makers in the earth? Or shall We make those who guard (against evil) like the wicked?
(It is) a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good that they may ponder over its verses, and that those endowed with understanding may reflect.
And We bestowed on David, Solomon, a most excellent servant! Surely he was frequent in turning (to Allah).
Lo! There were brought to him. in the evening, horses still when standing, swift when running. 
And he said, "Surely I have preferred the good things (of the world) over (or because of) the remembrance of my Lord." - until they were taken out of sight behind a veil (or the sun was hidden behind the veil of night).
(Then he said,) "Bring them back to me"; and he began to slash (or stroke) their legs and necks.
And certainly We tried Solomon, and We put on his throne a mere (soulless) body; then did he repent.
He said, "My Lord! Do you forgive me and grant me a kingdom which (may be) suits not anyone after me; for you are the Bestower of Bounties.
Then We made the wind subservient to him; it made his command to run gently wherever he desired,
And the devils (the unruly), every builder and diver, 
And others fettered in chains.
(Saying,) "These are Our Bounties (gift), therefore give freely or withhold, without reckoning."
And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent journey's end (return).
And remember Our servant Job, when he called upon his Lord saying, "The devil has afflicted me with distress and torment."
(It was said unto him) "Strike with your foot; here is a cool, refreshing washing-place and a drink."
And We gave him back his people and doubled their number, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to those possessed of understanding.
And (It was said,) "Take in your hand a green branch (or grass) and beat her (his rebellious wife gently) with it (rather than with cruelty), and break not your oath. Surely We found him patient; a most excellent servant! Surely he was frequent in turning (to Allah).
And remember Our servants Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, men of power and vision. 
Surely, We purified them with a pure thought, the remembrance of the Home of the Hereafter.
And most surely they were, in Our sight, of the company of the elect, the excellent.
And remember Ishmael and Elisha and Zul-Kifl - all were of the Company of the Good (or Chosen).
This is a reminder; and most surely there is an excellent destination for those who guard (against evil),
The Gardens of Eternity, whose doors are opened for them.
Wherein reclining, they call for many fruits and cool drink therein.
And with them shall be those restrained (modest) eyes, companions equal in age.
This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning.
Verily, this in truth is Our provision which will never fail;
This (shall be so for the righteous). And lo! There is an evil destination for the transgressors;
Hell; they will burn in it, an evil resting-place.
This (shall be so); then shall they taste it, boiling and intensely cold.
And other (punishment) of similar kind in pairs (of the two extremes).
Here is an army plunging in without consideration along with you; no welcome for them; surely they shall burn in the Fire.
They shall say, "Nay! Thee too! No welcome for you: it is you who have brought this upon us; evil is this resting-place."
They shall say, "Our Lord! Whoever prepared it first for us, add you to him a double chastisement in the Fire."
And they shall say, "What ails us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the wicked?
"Was it that we took them wrongly in scorn, or have our eyes missed them?
Verily, this is the truth - the mutual wrangling of the inmates of the fire.
Say, "I am only a Warner, and there is no God but Allah, the One, the Absolute (or Supreme and Irresistible):
"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and that which is between them, the Mighty Enforcer, the most Forgiving.
Say, "It is a message of great importance,
"From which you are turning away:
"1 had no knowledge of the Exalted Chiefs (in heaven) when they discussed (affairs):
"Naught is revealed to me save this, that I am a plain Warner."
Behold, your Lord said to the angels; Surely I am going to create a mortal from dust (or clay):
So when I have fashioned him in due proportions and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down making obeisance unto him.
And the angels did obeisance, all of them,
But not Iblis: he was too proud and became one of the disbelievers.
He said, "O Iblis! What prevented you from doing obeisance to him whom I created with My two hands? Are you too proud or are you of the Exalted Ones?"
He said, "I am better than he; Thou hast created me of Fire, and him Thou did create of dust (or clay)."
He said, "Then get you hence, for lo! you are outcast:
"And surely My curse is on you till the Day of Judgment."
He said, "My Lord! then reprieve me till the day that they are raised."
He said, "Surely you are of the reprieved ones,
"Until the Day of the time appointed."
He said, "Then by Thy Might I will surely beguile (tempt them to evil), every one,
"Except Thy single-minded servants from among them, the purified ones."
He said, "The Truth Is, and the Truth I speak:
"That I will most certainly fill hell with you and with those among them who follow you, every one."
Say (O Muhammad unto mankind), "I do not ask you for any reward for it; nor am I of the impostors:
"Lo! It (the Quran) is nothing but a reminder for all peoples (nations);
"And you will, in time, come to know the truth thereof."
The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.
Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, therefore serve Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience (or making religion pure for Him only).
Now, surely, sincere obedience (or pure religion) is due to Allah alone and those who take guardians besides Him, say, "We serve them only that they may bring us nearer to Allah". Surely Allah will judge between them in that in which they differ; surely Allah does not guide him aright who is a liar, ungrateful. 
If Allah desire to take a son to Himself, He will surely choose those He pleases from what He has created. Glory be to Him: He is Allah, the One, the Absolute.
He has created the heavens and the earth with Truth; He makes the night cover the day and makes the day overtake the night, and He has made the sun and the moon subservient; each one runs on to an assigned term; now surely is He not the Mighty, the great Forgiver?
He has created you from a single being, then made its mate of the same (kind), and He has made for you eight of the cattle in pairs. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, a creation after a creation, in triple darkness; that is Allah your Lord, His is the kingdom; there is no God but He; whence are you then turned away?
If you are ungrateful, then surely Allah is Independent (or self-sufficient) above all need of you; though He does not like ungratefulness in His servants; and if you are grateful, He is pleased with you; and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; in the end to your Lord is your return, then will He inform you of the truth of what you did; surely He is Aware of what is in the breasts (or heart of men).
And when distress afflicts a man he calls upon his Lord turning to Him frequently; then when He makes him possess a favour from Him, he forgets that for which he called upon Him before, and sets up rivals to Allah that he may cause (men) to stray off His path. Say: Enjoy yourself in your ungratefulness a little, surely you are of the inmates of the Fire.
What! Is he who is obedient during hours of the night, prostrating himself and standing, takes heed of the Hereafter and hopes for the mercy of his Lord (like one who does not)! Say: Are those who know and those who do not know alike? But only the men of understanding are mindful.
Say, "O my servants who believe! Be careful of (your duty to) your Lord; for those who do good in this world there is good, and Allah's earth is spacious; only the patient will be paid a reward without measure."
Say, "I am commanded that I should worship (serve) Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience (or making religion pure for Him only).
And I am commanded that I shall be the foremost of those who Surrender (in Islam)."
Say, "I would, if I disobey my Lord, indeed fear the chastisement of a grievous Day."
Say, "Allah (it is Whom) I serve, being sincere to Him in my exclusive devotion:
"Serve you what you like besides Him." Say, "The losers surely are those who shall have lost their own souls and their people on the Day of Resurrection; now surely that is the real (or manifest) loss."
They shall have coverings (layers) of fire above them and coverings (layers) beneath them; with this, Allah appals His servants, so be careful of (your duty to) Me, O My servants!
And as for those who put away false gods, lest they should worship them and turn to Allah, they shall have good news. Therefore give good news to My servants,
Those who listen to the Word (or advice) then follow the best (meaning) of it; those are they whom Allah has guided, and those it is who are the men of understanding.
What! Is he against whom the sentence of chastisement is justly due (equal to one who avoids evil): What! Can you save him who is in the Fire?
But those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they shall have high places, above them are built higher places, beneath which rivers flow - (this is) the promise of Allah: Allah will not fail in (His) promise.
Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud, then makes it go along in the earth in springs, then brings forth therewith herbage of various colours, then it withers so that you see it becoming yellow, then He makes it dry up and crumble? Most surely there is a reminder in this for the men of understanding.
What! Is he whose heart Allah has opened to the Surrender (Islam) so that he is in a light from his Lord (like him who is hard-hearted)? Nay, woe to those whose heart are hard against the remembrance of Allah; those are in clear error.
Allah has revealed the best of announcements (messages), a Scripture self-consistent in its various parts, repeating, whereat do shudder (or thrill) the skins of those who fear their Lord, so that their skins and their heart soften (or become pliant) to the remembrance of Allah. Such is Allah's guidance, wherewith He guides whom He wills; and as for him whom Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide.
Is then he who has to face the awful doom on the Day of Resurrection (as he who does right)? And it will be said to the unjust, "Taste what you earned."
Those before them (also) denied (the prophets or the revelation, the message), therefore there came to them the chastisement from whence they perceived not.
So Allah made them taste disgrace (or humiliation) in the life of this world, and certainly the punishment of the Hereafter is greater; did they but know!
And certainly We have set forth to men in this Quran similitudes of every sort that they may reflect.
A Lecture (Quran) in Arabic, without any crookedness, that they may guard (against evil).
Allah sets forth a similitude: There is a slave who belongs to several partners, differing (or quarrelling) with one another, and there is another slave wholly owned by one man. Are the two alike in condition? (All) praise is due to Allah. Nay! most of them do not know.
Surely you shall die and they too shall surely die.
Then lo! On the Day of Resurrection your disputes will be settled before your Lord.
Who is then more unjust than he who utters a lie against Allah and he who gives the lie to the truth when it comes to him; is there not in hell an abode for the disbelievers?
And he who brings the truth and he who accepts it as the truth, these are they that guard (against evil).
They shall have with their Lord what they please; that is the reward of the doers of good;
So that Allah will do away with the worst of what they did and give them their reward for the best of what they do.
Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And they seek to frighten you with those besides Him; and whomsoever Allah sends astray, there is no guide for him.
And whom Allah guides, there is none that can lead him astray; is not Allah Mighty, the Lord of Retribution?
And should you ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?", they would most certainly say, "Allah". Say, "Have you then considered that what you call upon besides Allah, would they, if Allah desire to afflict me with harm, be the removers of His harm, or, if Allah desire to show me mercy, would they be the withholders of His mercy?" Say, "Allah is sufficient for me; on Him do the trusting put their trust."
Say: O my people! Work in your manner (or work as and how you can), surely I too am working. But soon you will come to know
Who it is to whom there shall come a punishment which will disgrace him and to whom will be due an enduring punishment.
Verily, We have revealed to you the Book with the truth for the sake of mankind; so whoever follows the right way, it is for the good of his own soul and whoever errs, he errs only to its injury; and you are not a custodian over them.
Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep; then He withholds those on whom He has passed the decree of death and sends the others back till an appointed term; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.
Or have they taken intercessors besides Allah? Say, "What! Even though they did not ever have control over anything, nor do they understand.
Say, "To Allah belongs all intercession; His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, then to Him you shall be brought back."
And when Allah, the One and Only, is mentioned, the heart of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink, and when those besides Him are mentioned, lo! They are joyful.
Say, "O Allah! Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen! Only Thou judgest between Thy servants as to that wherein they differ."
And had those who are unjust all that is in the earth and the like of it with it, they would certainly offer it as ransom (to be saved) from the pain of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection; and what they never thought of shall become plain to them from Allah.
And the evil (consequences) of what they wrought shall become plain to them, and the very thing they mocked at shall beset them.
Now when harm afflicts a man he calls upon Us; then, when We give him a favour from Us, he says, "I have been given it only by means of knowledge." Nay, it is a trial, but most of them know not.
Those before them did indeed say this, but what they earned availed them not.
But there befell them the evil (consequences) of what they earned; and those who are unjust from among this generation, there shall also befall them the evil (consequences) of what they earn, and they shall not escape.
Do they not know that Allah enlarges the means of subsistence to whom He wills, and He restricts; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.
Say, "O my servants! Who have acted extravagantly (transgressed) against their own souls, do not despair of the mercy of Allah; surely Allah forgives all faults; surely He is the Forgiving the Merciful.
And return to your Lord time after time and submit to Him before there come unto you the punishment when you cannot be helped.
And follow the best of that which has been revealed to you from your Lord before the punishment comes suddenly while you do not even perceive;
Lest a soul should say, "O woe to me! For what I fell short of my duty to Allah, and I was indeed among the scoffers!"
Or should say, "Had Allah guided me, I would certainly have been of those who are dutiful!"
Or should say when it sees the punishment, "O, if I only had another chance that I might be among the righteous!"
(But the answer will be,) "Nay! For My revelations came to you, but you rejected them, and were haughty and you were among the unbelievers."
And on the Day of Resurrection you shall see those who lied against Allah; their faces shall be blackened. Is there not in hell an abode for the haughty?
And Allah shall deliver those who guard (against evil) with their achievement; evil shall not touch them, nor shall they grieve.
Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all things.
His are the keys of the heavens and the earth; and those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah, these it is that are the losers.
Say, "What! Do you then bid me serve others than Allah, O you ignorant (or stupid) ones?"
And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those before you, "Surely if you ascribe partners (with Allah), your work would certainly come to naught and you would certainly be of the losers."
Nay! But serve Allah alone and be of the thankful.
And they have not honoured Allah with the honour that is due to Him; and the whole earth shall be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens rolled up in His right hand; Glorified is He, and High Exalted above all that they ascribe as partners (unto Him).
And the trumpet shall be blown, and all those that are in the heavens and all those that are in the earth shall swoon away (or become unconscious), except such as Allah wills; then it shall be blown again, then lo! They shall stand up waiting.
And the earth shall beam with the light of its Lord, and the Book (Record) shall be laid open, and the prophets and the witnesses shall be brought up, and judgment shall be given between them with justice, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.
And every soul shall be paid back full for what it has done, and He knows best what they do.
And those who disbelieve shall be driven to hell in companies; until, when they come to it, its doors shall be opened, and the keepers of it shall say to them, "Did not there come to you messengers of your own, reciting to you the revelations (or communications) of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this your Day?" They shall say, "Yea, verily. But the sentence of punishment is fulfiled against the unbelievers."
It shall be said, "Enter the gates of hell to abide therein; so evil is the abode of the haughty."
And those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord shall be conveyed to the Garden in companies; until when they come to it, and its doors are opened, the keepers of it shall say to them, "Peace be on you, you have done well; therefore enter in to abide therein."
And they shall say, "All praise is due to Allah, Who has made good to us His promise, and He has given us this land as a heritage; we may dwell in the Garden where we please; so goodly is the reward of the workers.
And you shall see the angels going round about the throne glorifying the praise of their Lord; and judgment shall be given between them with justice, and it shall be said, "All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
Ha Mim. (Two Arabic letters)
The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Knower,
The Forgiver of the faults and the Acceptor of repentance, Severe in punishment, Who has a Long Reach; there is no God but He; to Him is the journeying (the Final Goal).
None dispute concerning the revelations (or Signs) of Allah but those who disbelieve, therefore, let not their strutting in the cities deceive you.
The people of Noah and the parties after them rejected (Prophets) before them, and every nation purposed against their Messengers to destroy him, and they disputed by means of falsehoods that they might thereby render null the truth, therefore I destroyed them; how terrible was then My retribution!
And thus did the word of your Lord prove true against those who disbelieved that they are the inmates of the Fire.
Those who bear the Throne and those around Him celebrate the praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask protection for those who believe, saying, "Our Lord! Thou embracest all things (have a Long Reach) in mercy and knowledge, therefore grant protection to those who turn to Thee and follow Thy way, and save them from the punishment of Hell:
"Our Lord! And make them enter the Gardens of Eternity which Thou hast promised to them and the righteous among their fathers and their wives and their offspring. Surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.
"And keep them from evil deeds, and whom Thou keepest from evil deeds this day, Thou hast indeed taken into Thine mercy, and that is the supreme triumph.
Surely those who disbelieve shall be addressed, "Verily, Allah's abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one to another, when you were called unto the faith and you refused."
They shall say, "Our Lord! Twice didst Thou makest us die, and twice hast Thou givestn us life, so we do confess our faults; is there then a way to get out?"
(The reply is,) "This is because when Allah alone was called upon, you disbelieved, and when associates were given to Him, you believed; but the Command belongs only to Allah, the Sublime, the Majestic.
He it is Who shows you His signs and sends down for you sustenance from heaven. None pays heed but he who turns (to Him).
Therefore call upon Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience (or making Religion pure for Him), however much the unbelievers are averse:
The Exalter of Ranks (or Exalted above all Ranks and degrees), Lord of the Throne (of Power and Authority): He casts (or sends) the Spirit by His command upon whom He wills of His servants, that he may warn (men) of the Day of Meeting.
The Day when they shall come forth, nothing concerning them being hidden from Allah, to whom belongs the kingdom this day? To Allah, the One, the Almighty (or the Irresistible).
This day every soul shall be rewarded for what it has earned; no injustice (shall be done) this day; Lo! Allah is swift in reckoning.
And warn them of the day that draws near, when heart shall rise up to the throats to choke them; the wrongdoers shall have no compassionate friend nor any intercessor who will be heard.
He knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts conceal.
Allah judges with truth; but those whom they call upon besides Him cannot judge aught; surely Allah is the Hearer, the Seer.
Have they not travelled in the earth and seen the nature of the consequences for those who disbelieved before them? Mightier than these were they in strength, and in the traces they made in the earth. Yet Allah destroyed them for their sins; and they had no defender against Allah.
That was because there came to them their messengers with clear arguments, but they rejected (them), therefore Allah destroyed them; surely He is Strong, Severe in retribution.
And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations (message, communications) and a clear authority,
To Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, but they said, "A lying sorcerer."
So when he brought to them the truth from Us, they said, "Slay the sons of those who believe with him and keep their women alive." But the plots of unbelievers come to nothing but errors (and delusions).
And Pharaoh said, "Leave me to slay Moses and let him call upon his Lord; surely I fear that he will change your religion or that he will make mischief to appear in the land."
And Moses said, "Surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant scorner who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.
And a believing man of Pharaoh's people who hid his faith said, "What! Will you slay a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah, and indeed he has brought to you clear arguments from your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him will be (the consequences of) his lie, and if he be truthful, there will befall you some of that of which he warns you; surely Allah does not guide him who is a transgressing liar:
"'O my people! Yours is the kingdom this day, being masters in the land, but who will help us against the wrath of Allah if it come to us? ' Pharaoh said, "I do not show you aught but that which I see myself, and I do not make you follow any but the right way.
And he who believed said, “O my people! Surely I fear for you the like of what befell the parties of old.
"A plight the like of what befell the people of Noah and A'ad and Thamud and those after them, and Allah wills no injustice for His servants;
"And, O my people! I fear for you the Day of Summoning,
"The day on which you will turn back retreating; there shall be no saviour (or defender) for you from Allah, and whomsoever Allah causes to err, there is no guide for him:
And verily Joseph came to you before with clear arguments, yet you ceased not to be in doubt as to what he brought; until when he died, you said, 'Allah will never raise a messenger after him.' Thus does Allah cause him to err who is extravagant, a doubter,
Those who dispute concerning the revelation (signs or communications) of Allah without any authority that He has given them; greatly hated is it by Allah and by those who believe. Thus does Allah set a seal over the heart of every proud, haughty one.
And Pharaoh said, "O Haman! Build for me a tower that I may attain the ways and means,
The ways and means of access to the heavens that I might look upon the God of Moses, and I surely think him to be a liar. And thus the evil of his deed was made fair-seeming unto Pharaoh, and he was debarred from the Way. The plot of Pharaoh was not to end in aught but destruction.
And he who believed said, "O my people! Follow me; I will guide you to the Right Way;
"O my people! This life of the world is only a passing enjoyment, and surely the Hereafter is the enduring home;
"Whoever does an evil, he shall be recompensed with the like of it, and whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, these shall enter the Garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without measure.
"And, O my people! How (strange) is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the fire?
"You call on me that I should disbelieve in (or blaspheme against) Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I call you to the Mighty, the most Forgiving;
"Assuredly that to which you call me to has no claim to be called to in this world, nor in the Hereafter, and that our return is to Allah, and the extravagant (or transgressors, those who go beyond the limits) will be inmates of the Fire; 
"And you will remember what I say unto you, and I entrust my cause to Allah. Verily, Allah is Seer of his servants."
So Allah protected him from the evil of what they planned, and the most evil punishment overtook Pharaoh's people:
The Fire, they shall be brought before it morning and evening and on the Day when the Hour (of Judgment) shall come to pass, (it will be said,) "Make Pharaoh's people enter the severest penalty.
And when they shall contend one with another in the Fire, then the weak shall say to those who were proud, "Surely we were your followers; will you then avert from us a portion of the fire?"
Those who were proud shall say, "Surely we are all in it: surely Allah has judged between His servants."
And those who are in the fire shall say to the keepers of Hell, "Call upon your Lord that He may lighten to us one day of this punishment."
They shall say, "Did not your messengers come to you with clear arguments?” They shall say, "Yea." They shall say, "Then pray." But the prayer of those without faith is only futile (wandering in) error.
Most surely We help Our messengers, and those who believe, in the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses arise,
The day on which their excuse shall not benefit the unjust, and for them is a curse and for them is the abode of misery.
And certainly We gave Moses the guidance, and We caused the children of Israel to inherit the Book,
A guidance and a reminder to the men of understanding.
Therefore, be patient; surely the promise of Allah is true; and ask protection for your fault and sing the praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.
Surely those who dispute about the revelations (signs, communications) of Allah without any authority that has come to them, there is naught in their breasts but (a desire) to become great which they shall never attain. Therefore, seek refuge in Allah, surely He, only He is the Hearer, the Seer.
Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of the men, but most of mankind know not.
And the blind and the seeing are not alike, nor those who believe and do good and the evildoer; little is it that you reflect.
Most surely the hour is coming, there is no doubt therein, but most people believe not.
And your Lord has said, "Call upon Me, I will answer you; surely those who are too proud for My service shall soon enter Hell abased."
Allah is He Who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day to see; most surely Allah is Gracious to men, but most men do not give thanks. 
That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of everything; there is no God but He; How then are you perverted (turned or deluded)? 
Thus were turned away those who denied the Signs (revelations, communications) of Allah. 
Allah is He Who made the earth a resting-place for you and the heaven a canopy, and He formed you, then made goodly your forms, and He provided you with goodly things; that is Allah, your Lord; blessed then is Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. 
He is the Living One. There is no God but He, therefore call on (pray to) Him, being sincere to Him in obedience (or making Religion pure for Him or Surrendering to Him in Islam); All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. 
Say, "I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides Allah when clear arguments have come to me from my Lord, and I am commanded that I should Surrender (in Islam) to the Lord of the Worlds. 
He it is Who created you from dust, then from a small germ-cell, then from a clot, then He brings you forth as a child, then that you may attain your maturity, then that you may be old - though some of you are caused to die before - and that you may reach an appointed term, and that you may understand.
He it is Who gives life and brings death, so when He decrees an affair, He only says to it, "Be", and it is.
Have you not seen those who dispute with respect to the Signs (or revelations) of Allah: how are they turned away?
Those who reject the Book and that with which We have sent Our Messenger; but they shall soon come to know, 
When the fetters and the chains shall be on their necks; they shall be dragged 
Into boiling water, then in the Fire shall they be burned; 
Then shall it be said to them, "Where is that which you used to set up (for worship) 
Besides Allah?" They shall say, "They have failed us. Nay, we used not to pray to anything before." Thus does Allah confound the unbelievers. 
(It is said,) "That is because you exulted in the earth unjustly and because you behaved insolently."
Enter the gates of hell to abide therein, evil then is the abode of the scornful (arrogant).
So be patient (O Muhammad), verily the promise of Allah is true. Whether We let you see part of what We promise them, or whether We cause you to die, to Us shall they be returned.
And certainly We sent messengers before you: there are some of them that We have mentioned to you and there are others whom We have not mentioned to you; and it was not meet for a messenger that he should bring a sign except with Allah's permission, but when the command of Allah came, judgment was given with truth, and those who treated (it) as a lie (or followed vanities) were lost.
Allah is He Who made the cattle for you that you may ride on some of them, and some of them you eat.
And there are many benefits for you in them, and that you may attain through them a want which is in your breasts, and are borne upon them as upon the ships.
And He shows you His signs: which then of Allah's signs will you deny?
Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them? They were more numerous than these and greater in strength and in the traces they made in the earth, but what they earned availed them not.
Then when their messengers came to them with clear arguments, they exulted in what they had with them of knowledge, and there beset them that which they used to mock.
But when they saw Our punishment, they said, "We believe in Allah alone and we deny what we used to associate with Him."
But their belief could not avail them when they had seen Our punishment; this is Allah's law, which has indeed held true for His servants, and then the disbelievers perished (or were ruined).
Ha Mim!
A revelation from the Beneficent, the Merciful.
A Book (Scripture) whereof the verses are expounded, an Arabic Quran (Lecture) for a people who understand;
Giving good news and a warning, but most of them turn aside so they hear not.
And they say, "Our heart are under veils from that to which you call us, and there is a deafness in our ears, and a screen hangs between us and you. So do you (as you will), we too are doing (what we will)."
Say (O Muhammad), "I am only a mortal like you; it is revealed to me that your God is one Allah, therefore follow the right way to Him and ask His forgiveness". And woe unto the idolaters (those who join gods with Allah);
Those who give not regular charity and who deny the Hereafter.
Those who believe and do good, they shall surely have a reward unfailing.
Say, "What! Do you indeed disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days (periods), and do you set up rivals with Him? He (none else) is the Lord of the Worlds.
And He made in it firm mountains rising above its surface, and He blessed the earth and measured therein the sustenance for all things in four Days (periods), alike (or in accordance with their needs) for all seekers.
He directed Himself to the heaven when it was smoke (or gas), so He said unto it and unto the earth, "Come you together (or both), willingly or unwillingly." They both said, " We come in willing obedience."
So He ordained them seven heavens in two periods, and revealed in every heaven its affairs (duties and functions); and We adorned the lower heaven with brilliant stars and made it inviolable (guarded); that is the decree of the Mighty, the Knower.
But if they turn aside, then say: "I have warned you of a scourge like the scourge of A'ad and Thamud."
When their messengers came to them from before them and from behind them, saying, "Serve nothing but Allah", they said, "If our Lord had pleased He would certainly have sent down angels, so we are surely unbelievers in that with which you are sent."
Then as to A'ad, they were unjustly arrogant in the land, and they said, "Who is mightier in strength than we?" Did they not see that Allah Who created them was mightier than they in strength? But they denied Our Signs!
So We sent on them a furious wind in disastrous days, that We may make them taste the torment of abasement in the life of the world. But verily, the chastisement of the Hereafter is much more shameful, and they shall not be helped.
And as to Thamud, We showed them the right way, but they chose blindness (of heart) above guidance, so there overtook them the stunning (like a bolt of lightening) punishment of humiliation for what they earned.
And We delivered those who believed and did their duty to Allah.
And on the day that the enemies of Allah shall be gathered into the fire, they will be marched in ranks,
Until when they come to it, their ears and their eyes and their skins shall bear witness against them as to what they did.
And they shall say to their skins, "Why have you borne witness against us?" They shall say, "Allah Who gives speech to all things has given us speech, and He Who created you at first, unto Him you are returning.
"And you did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should bear witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know most of what you did.
"And that it was your own thought which you entertained about your Lord that have brought you to ruin (or destruction, perdition), so you find yourselves this day among the lost.
Then though they are resigned, still the fire is their abode, and if they ask for favour, yet are they not of those unto whom favour can be shown.
And We have appointed for them comrades (in the world) who made fair-seeming to them what is before them and what is behind them (in their future and their past). And the sentence concerning the nations of jinn and men that have passed away before them is proved true against them; for verily they are the losers.
And those who disbelieve say, "Do not listen to this Quran and do make a noise in the midst of its reading that you may overcome it."
Therefore, We will certainly make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, and We will certainly requite them for the evil deeds they used to do.
That is the reward of the enemies of Allah - the Fire. Therein is their eternal home; the payment for denying Our signs.
And those who disbelieve will say, "Our Lord! Show us those who led us astray from among the jinn and men that we may trample them under our feet so that they may be of the lowest."
As for those who say, "Our Lord is Allah", then continue steadfast in righteousness, the angels descend upon them, saying, "Fear not, nor be grieved, and receive good news of the Garden which you were promised.
"We are your guardians in the life of this world and in the Hereafter, and you shall have therein what your souls desire and you shall have therein all you ask for:
"A provision from the Forgiving, the Merciful."
And who speaks better than he who calls to Allah while he himself does good, and says, "I am of those who Surrender (in Islam)"?
And not alike are the good and the evil. Repel evil with what is best, when lo! He between whom and you was enmity would be as if he were an intimate friend.
And none are granted this power but those who possess patience and self-restraint, and none are granted it but the owners of great happiness.
And if a whisper (incitement or interference) of the Satan should cause you mischief, then seek refuge in Allah; surely He is the Hearer, the Knower.
And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Make not obeisance to the sun nor to the moon; but make obeisance to Allah Who created them, if Him it is that you serve.
But if they are too proud, yet those who are with your Lord glorify Him night and the day, and tire not.
And among His signs is this, that you see the earth barren and desolate, but when We send down on it the rain, it stirs to life and swells into growth: verily He Who gives it life is the Quickener of the dead; surely He has power over all things.
Surely they who distort Our revelations are not hidden from Us. What! Is he, then, who is cast into the Fire better, or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do what you like, surely He is Seer of what you do.
Surely those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it comes to them (are losers, for most surely it is a Book of exalted power.
Falsehood shall not come to it from before it nor from behind it, a revelation from the Wise, the Owner of Praise.
Naught is said unto you (O Muhammad) but what was said unto the messengers before you; surely your Lord is the Lord of Forgiveness and the Lord of dire Retribution.
And if We had made it a Lecture (Quran) in a foreign tongue, they would certainly have said, "Why have not its verses been explained clearly? What! A foreign (tongue) and an Arab (messenger)!" Say, "It is to those who believe, a guidance and a healing; and as for those who disbelieve, there is a deafness in their ears and it is blindness (obscurity) to them; these shall be called to from afar.
And certainly We gave the Book to Moses, but dispute arose therein. Had not a word already gone forth from your Lord, judgment would certainly have been given ere now between them (the disputers); and lo! They are in hopeless doubt about it.
Whoever does good, it is for the good his own soul, and whoever does wrong, it is against it; and your Lord is not in the least unjust (or tyrannical) to His servants.
To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment), and no fruits comes forth from their coverings, nor does a female bear or give birth, but with His knowledge. And on the Day when He shall call unto them, "Where are (those whom you called) My associates?" They shall say, "We declare to Thee, none of us is a witness."
And away from them shall go what they called upon before, and they shall know for certain that there is no escape for them.
Man is never tired of praying for good, and if evil touch him, then he is despairing, hopeless.
And verily, if We make him taste mercy from Us after distress that has touched him, he would say, "This is of me, and I do not think the Hour will come to pass, and if I am sent back to my Lord, I shall have with Him sure good." But We will most certainly inform the disbelievers of all that which they did, and We will most certainly make them taste of hard chastisement.
And when We show favour to man, he turns aside and withdraws himself; and when evil touches him, he makes lengthy supplications.
Say, "Bethink you: if it is from Allah and you reject it, who is in greater error than he who is in open feud (or schism or opposition)?
We will soon show them Our signs on the horizons (in the Universe) and within themselves (or their own souls), until it become manifest unto them that it is the truth. Is not your Lord sufficient , since He is Witness over all things?
What! Are they still in doubt about the meeting with their Lord? What! Does He not encompass (surround and penetrate) all things?
Ha Mim. (Two mystical letters in Arabic)
Ain Sin Qaf. (Three more mystical letters)
Thus does Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, reveal to you, as to those before you.
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great (or the Sublime, the Tremendous).
The heavens may almost be rent asunder from above them (by His Glory) while the angels sing the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth; verily Allah is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
And as for those who take guardians besides Him, Allah watches over them, and you are not in charge over them.
And thus have We revealed to you an Arabic Lecture (Quran), that you may warn the Mother City (Mecca) and those around it, and that you may give warning of the Day of Gathering wherein is no doubt; when some will be in the Garden and some in the burning Fire.
And if Allah had willed He would surely have made them a single community, but He makes whom He wills enter into His mercy, and the unjust it is that shall have no guardian or helper.
Or have they taken guardians besides Him? But Allah, He is the Guardian, and He gives life to the dead, and He has power over all things.
And in whatever thing you disagree, the judgment thereof is in the hands of Allah; such is Allah, my Lord, on Him do I trust and to Him do I turn.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, He made pairs for you from among yourselves, and pairs of the cattle too, multiplying you thereby. There is no thing like unto Him; and He is the Hearer, the Seer.
His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; He expands or restricts the means of subsistence for whom He wills; verily, He is Aware of all things.
He has ordained for you the religion which He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you (Muhammad) and that which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying, "Establish religion (obedience) and be not divided therein. Dreadful for the disbelievers is that to which you calls them; Allah chooses for Himself whom He will, and guides to Himself him who turns to Him.
And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of rivalry among themselves; and had not a Word already gone forth from your Lord for an appointed term, certainly judgment would have been given between them; and those who were made to inherit the Book after them are most surely in hopeless (or suspicious, disturbing) doubt concerning it.
Therefore, unto this (scripture) then go on inviting, and be you upright and steadfast as you are commanded, and follow not their vain desires, and say, "I believe in what Allah has revealed of the Book, and I am commanded to do justice between you: Allah is our Lord and your Lord; unto us our deeds and unto you your deeds; no argument between us and you: Allah will gather us together, and to Him is our final Goal (or return)."
And as for those who dispute about Allah after that obedience has been rendered to Him, their dispute is futile with their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is a terrible penalty.
Allah it is Who revealed the Book with truth, and the Balance, and what shall make you realise that perhaps the Hour be nigh?
Those who do not believe in it would hasten it on, and those who believe are in awe of it, and they know that it is the truth. Now most surely those who dispute obstinately concerning the Hour are in a great error.
Gracious is Allah to His servants; He gives sustenance to whom He pleases, and He is the Strong, the Mighty.
Whoever desires the tilth (means of harvest, gain) of the Hereafter, We will give him increase in it; and whoever desires the tilth (means of harvest, gain) of this world, We give him of it, and in the Hereafter he has no portion.
Or have they partners for Allah who have prescribed for them a religion that Allah permits not? Had it not been for the Word of Decision judgment would have certainly been given between them; but verily the wrong-doers shall have a painful doom.
you see  the wrong-doers fearful on account of what they have earned, and it must necessarily befall them; and those who believe and do good shall be in the luxurious meadows of the Gardens; they shall have what they please with their Lord: that is the great Grace (Bounty).
That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants, those who believe and do good deeds. Say (O Muhammad), "I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives"; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein; surely Allah is Forgiving, Responsive (appreciative of service).
Or do they say, "He has forged a lie against Allah"? But if Allah pleased, He would seal your heart; and Allah will blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with His words; verily, He is Aware of what is in the breasts.
And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the evil deeds and He knows all that you do.
And He answers those who believe and do good deeds, and gives increase unto them of His bounty; and as for the unbelievers, they shall have a severe punishment.
And if Allah were to enlarge (increase, improve, enrich) the provision for His servants they would certainly transgress beyond bounds through the earth; but He sends it down in due measure as He pleases; surely He is Aware of, a Seer (Watchful) of His servants.
And He it is Who sends down the saving rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds (scatters) His mercy; and He is the Guardian, the Praiseworthy.
And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living creatures He has spread forth through them; and He has all power to gather them together when He wills.
And whatever affliction befalls you, it is on account of what your hands have wrought, and yet He pardons much.
And you cannot escape in the earth, and you shall not have a guardian or a helper besides Allah.
And among His signs are the ships in the sea, tall as mountains.
If He pleases, He causes the wind to become still so that they lie motionless on its back; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one,
Or He may make them perish for what they have earned, though He forgives much;
And that those who dispute about Our revelations may know that they have no refuge.
So whatever thing you are given, that is only a provision of the life of this world, and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord.
And those who. shun the great sins and indecencies, and whenever they are angry they forgive.
And those who respond to their Lord and establish prayer, and whose conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and who spend out of what We have given them.
And those who, when great wrong afflicts them, defend themselves.
And the recompense of evil is punishment like it, but whoever forgives and amends, he shall have his reward from Allah; surely He does not love the unjust.
And whoever defends himself after he has been wronged (or been oppressed), for such there is no blame against them.
The blame is only against those who oppress men and revolt (insolently exceed all bounds) in the earth unjustly; these shall have a painful punishment.
And whoever is patient and forgiving, these most surely are actions of courage and resolution.
And whomsoever Allah makes err, he has no guardian after Him; and you shall see the unjust, when they see the punishment, saying, "Is there any way to return?"
And you shall see them brought before it (the Fire) humbled by disgrace, looking with veiled eyes (or furtively). And those who believe shall say, "Surely the true losers are they who have lost themselves and their followers on the Day of Resurrection. Now surely the iniquitous shall remain in lasting torment."
And they shall have no friends to help them instead of Allah; whomsoever Allah sends astray, for him there is no road.
Hearken to your Lord before there comes the Day from your Lord which there is no averting; you shall have no refuge on that Day, nor shall there be room for denial.
But if they turn away, We have not sent you as a warder over them; yours is only to deliver (the message). Surely when We make man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices there at; and if an evil afflicts them on account of what their hands have already done, then lo! Man is ungrateful.
Unto Allah belongs the sovereignty (or kingdom) of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He wills; He bestows daughters to whom He will and bestows sons to whom He will.
Or He mingles them, male and female; and He makes barren whom He wills; verily, He is the Knower, Powerful. 
And it is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to them unless it be by revelation or from behind a veil, or He sends a messenger to reveal what He will by His leave. Lo, He is Exalted, Wise.
And thus did We reveal to you (Muhammad) an inspired Book by Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor what the faith was, but We made it a light, guiding thereby whom We will of Our servants; and most surely you guide unto the Straight Way,
The Way of Allah, to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come.
Ha Mim. (two mystical letters)
By the Book that makes things clear:
Surely We have made it an Arabic Lecture (Quran) that you may understand.
And surely it is in the Mother of the Books with Us, truly sublime, full of wisdom.
What! Shall We, then, turn away the Reminder (Quran) from you altogether because you are a wanton (transgressing) people?
And how many a prophet have We sent among the ancients.
And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at him.
Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in prowess, and the case of the ancients has gone before them,
And if you should ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" they would most certainly say, "The Mighty, the Knower, has created them";
Yea, He Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and made in it ways for you that you may go aright;
And Who sends down water from the cloud according to a measure, then We raise to life thereby a dead land, even thus shall you be brought forth;
And He Who created pairs of all things, and made for you of the ships and the cattle that you ride on,
That you may firmly sit on their backs, then remember the favour of your Lord when you are firmly seated thereon, and say, "Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us, for we could not do it by ourselves.
"And surely to our Lord we are returning."
And yet they attribute to His servants a share in the Godhead; truly man is ungrateful.
What! Has He taken daughters to Himself out of what He Himself creates and chosen you to have sons? 
And when one of them is given news (of the birth) of that of which he sets up as a likeness for the Beneficent Allah (i.e. daughters), his face becomes black and he is full of rage.
What! (Liken they Allah to) that which is bred among ornaments and which in disputes cannot make itself plain (or give an account of itself)!
And they make the angels, who are the servants of the Beneficent Allah, female (divinities). What! Did they witness their creation? Their evidence shall be recorded and they shall be questioned.
And they say, "If the Beneficent Allah had pleased, we should never have worshipped them." They have no knowledge of this; they only lie.
Or have We given them a book before it (the Quran) so that they hold fast to it?
Nay! They say, "We found our fathers in a religion, and surely we are guided by their footsteps."
And even so, We did not send before you  (Muhammad) any Warner into any town, but those who led easy lives in it (the wealthy or leisured) said, "Surely we found our fathers in a religion, and surely we will follow in their footsteps."
He (The Warner) said, "What! Even if I bring to you a better guide than that in which you found your fathers?" They said, "Lo! We deny that you are sent (or that with which you are sent)."
So We inflicted retribution on them, then see how was the end of the rejecters.
And when Abraham said to his father and his people, "Surely I am innocent of what you worship,
"Save Him Who created me, for surely He will guide me."
And he left it as a word to endure in his posterity that they may return (to Allah).
Nay! I let them and their fathers enjoy life until there came to them the Truth and a Messenger making things clear.
And when the Truth came to them they said, "This is magic, and lo! We are disbelievers in it."
And they say, "Why was not this Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns?"
Will they distribute (portion out, administer) the mercy of your Lord? We distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world, and We have exalted some of them above others in degrees, that some of them may take others in subjection (or take labour from others or command and direct others); and the mercy of your Lord is better than what they amass.
And were it not that all mankind might have become of a single (evil) community (or way of life), We might well have assigned to those who blaspheme against the Beneficent silver for the roofs of their houses and the stairs by which they ascend.
And for the doors of their houses and the couches on which they recline,
And also ornaments of gold. But all this is naught but provision of the life of this world, and the Hereafter with your Lord is only for the righteous (or those who guard against evil).
And whoever turns himself away from the remembrance of the Beneficent (Allah), We appoint for him a devil (or a Satan), who becomes his comrade.
And most surely they turn them away from the path, and they think that they are guided aright:
Until when he comes to Us, he says (to his devil), "O would that between me and you there were the distance of the two Easts"; evil, indeed, is the companion!
And since you were wrong-doers, it will not profit you this day that you are sharers in the chastisement.
What! Can you (O Muhammad) make the deaf to hear or guide the blind and him who is in clear error?
But if We should take you away, still We shall inflict retribution on them;
Or We will show you that which We have promised them; for surely We are the possessors of full power over them.
Therefore hold fast to that which has been revealed to you; surely you are on the Straight Way.
And most surely it (the Quran) is a Reminder for you and your people, and you shall soon be questioned.
And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Beneficent?
And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations to Pharaoh and his chiefs, so he said, "Surely I am the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds."
But when he came to them with Our signs, lo! They laughed at them.
And every sign that We showed them was greater than its predecessor, and We overtook them with chastisement that they may turn (to Us).
And they said, "O sorcerer! Call on your Lord for our sake, by the covenant He has made with you; we shall surely become followers of the right way.
But when We removed from them the chastisement, lo! They broke the pledge.
And Pharaoh proclaimed amongst his people, saying, "O my people! Is not the sovereignty of Egypt mine? And these rivers which flow beneath me; do you not then see?
"Nay! I am surely better than this fellow, who is a contemptible wretch, and who can hardly speak distinctly (or plainly):
"But why have not bracelets of gold been put upon him, or why have there not come with him angels as companions?"
So he incited his people to levity and they obeyed him: surely they were a transgressing people.
Then when they displeased Us, We inflicted a retribution on them, so We drowned them every one,
And We made them a precedent and example to the later generations.
And when the example of the son of Mary (Jesus) is given, lo! Your people raise a clamour (of ridicule) there at.
And they say, "Are our gods better, or is he?" They raise not the objection save by way of disputation; nay, they are a contentious people.
He was naught but a servant on whom We bestowed favour, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.
And if We please, We could make among you angels to be vicegerents (or successors) in the land.
And most surely it is (the above events or the Quran or he, Jesus) is a sign of the knowledge of coming of the Hour (of Resurrection and Judgment), therefore have no doubt about it and follow Me: this is the Straight Way.
And let not the Satan prevent you; surely he is your open enemy.
And when Jesus came with clear arguments he said, "I have come unto you with wisdom, and that I may make clear to you some of that wherein you differ; so be careful of your duty to Allah and obey me:
"Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore serve Him; this is the right path." (See John10:37-38,17:3-14)
But parties from among them differed, so woe to those who do wrong because of the chastisement of a painful day.
Do they wait for aught but the Hour, that it should come upon them all of a sudden while they perceive not?
The friends shall on that day be enemies one to another, except those who guard (against evil).
O My servants! There is no fear for you this day, nor shall you grieve,
Those who believed in Our revelations and Surrendered (in Islam),
Enter you the Garden, you and your wives, rejoicing.
There shall be sent round to them golden plates and cups and therein shall be all that their souls desire, and delights the eyes, and you shall abide therein.
Such will be the Garden which you are given as an inheritance for what you did.
For you therein are abundant fruits of which you shall eat with full satisfaction.
Surely the guilty shall abide in the chastisement of hell.
It shall not be abated from them and they shall despair therein.
It is not We who are unjust to them, but it is they who were unjust to themselves.
And they shall call out, "O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us." He shall say, "Verily, here you must remain."
Certainly We have brought you the Truth, but most of you are averse to the Truth.
Or have they settled affairs? But it is We who are the Settlers.
Or do they think that We do not hear what they conceal and their secret discourses? Indeed We do, and Our messengers are with them, recording.
Say, "If the Beneficent has a son, I am the foremost of those who serve him."
Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne (of Authority), from what they describe.
So leave them flounder in false discourses and sporting until they meet their Day which they are promised.
And He it is Who is God in the heavens and God in the earth; and He is the Wise, the Knower.
And blessed is He Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, and to Him shall you be returned.
And those whom they call upon besides Him have no power of intercession, except he who bears witness unto the Truth with sure knowledge (or they know him -i.e. Muhammad).
And if you should ask them who created them, they would certainly say, "Allah." Whence are they then turned away?
Consider his (the Prophet's) cry, "O my Lord! Surely they are a people who do not believe."
So turn away from them and say, "Peace", for they shall soon come to know.
Ha Mim!
By the Book that makes plain.
Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning (against evil and its consequences) - 
Therein (the blessed night) every wise affair is made clear,
A command from Us; surely We are ever the senders (of revelations),
As a mercy from your Lord. Surely He is the Hearer, the Knower,
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would be sure (in faith.)
There is no God but He; He quickens and causes death, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.
Nay, but they make sport in doubt,
Therefore, keep waiting for the day when the heaven shall bring evident smoke (or mist),
That shall overtake men; this is a painful punishment.
(They pray,) "Our Lord! Remove from us the punishment; surely we are believers."
How can they remember (or understand Allah or the message), when a Messenger making clear (the truth) had already come to them,
Butt they had turned their backs on him and said, "He is one taught by others, a madman."
Lo! We remove the punishment a little, (but) you will surely return (to evil).
On the day when We will seize them with a mighty seizing, We will indeed exact retribution.
And certainly We tried before them the people of Pharaoh, and there came to them a noble Messenger,
Saying, "Deliver to me the servants of Allah; surely I am a trustworthy messenger unto you,
"And be not arrogant against Allah, for I come with clear authority:
"And surely I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against your stoning me to death:
"And if you put no faith in me, then let me go."
Then he called upon his Lord, "These are a guilty people".
(The reply came,) "So go forth with My servants by night; for surely you will be pursued:
"And leave the sea divided (as a furrow); surely they are a host that shall be drowned."
How many are the gardens and springs they have left behind!
And corn fields and noble places!
And goodly things wherein they rejoiced;
Thus it was, and We gave them as a heritage to another people.
So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they respited.
And certainly We delivered the children of Israel from the abasing chastisement,
From Pharaoh; surely he was haughty, (and) one of those who committed excesses.
And certainly We chose them, knowingly (or purposely), above all the nations.
And We gave them signs wherein was a clear trial.
Lo! These (the pagan Arabs) say,
"There is naught but our first death and we shall not be raised again.
"Bring back our fathers, if you are truthful."
What! Are they better than the people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty.
And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in sport.
We create them both not, except with truth, but most of them know not.
Assuredly the Day of Decision (or of Sorting) is the term appointed for all of them,
The day on which friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped,
Save those on whom Allah has mercy; surely He is the Mighty the Merciful.
Behold the tree of Zaqqum,
Is the food of the sinful,
Like molten brass, it shall boil in (their) bellies,
Like the seesing of boiling water.
(It will be said,) "Seize him, then drag him down into the midst of hell;
Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water:
"Saying, 'Taste; lo! You were forsooth the mighty, the noble!
"'Surely this is what you used to doubt!'"
Surely the righteous are in a secure place,
Amidst Gardens and springs;
Attired in fine silk and rich brocade, face to face;
Thus shall it be, and We will join them with Houris (pure and beautiful companions) with wide, lovely eyes.
They shall call in safety therein for every fruit;
They taste not death therein except the first death (i.e. in this physical life), and He will have saved them from the doom of hell,
A grace from your Lord; this is the supreme achievement (or triumph).
Verily We have made it (the Quran) easy in your tongue that they may be mindful.
Therefore wait (O Muhammad); they too are waiting.
Ha Mim.
The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.
Most surely in the heavens and the earth there are signs for the believers.
And in your own creation and in what He spreads abroad of animals there are signs for a people that have faith;
And in the variation of the night and the day, and in the sustenance Allah sends down from the clouds, then gives life thereby to the earth after its death, and in the changing of the winds, there are signs for a people who understand.
These are the Signs of Allah which We recite to you with Truth; then in what explanations would they believe after (rejecting) Allah and His Signs?
Woe to every sinful dealer in falsehood,
Who hears the Signs of Allah recited to him, then persists proudly as though he had not heard them; so announce to him a grievous punishment.
And when he comes to know of any of Our revelations, he takes it for a jest; these it is that shall have abasing doom.
Before them is Hell, and there shall not avail them aught of what they earned, nor those whom they took for guardians besides Allah, and they shall have an awful doom.
This is guidance; and as for those who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord, they shall have a painful penalty because of their abominations.
It is Allah Who has made subservient to you the sea that the ships may run therein by His command, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may give thanks.
And He has subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, all from Himself; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.
Tell those who believe that they should forgive those who fear (or hope) not the days of Allah, that He may reward a people for what they earn.
Whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against it; then you shall be brought back to your Lord.
And certainly We gave the Book and the Wisdom and the Prophecy to the children of Israel, and We gave them of the goodly things, and We made them excel over other nations.
And We gave them clear commandments in (religious) affairs, but they did not differ until after knowledge had come to them, through rivalry among themselves; surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ.
And now have We set you on a clear course in (religious) affairs, therefore follow it, and do not follow the low desires of those who know not.
Surely they shall not avail you in the least against Allah; and surely the unjust are friends of each other, and Allah is the guardian of those who guard (against evil).
These are clear proofs for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy for a people who have sure faith.
What! Do those who have wrought evil deeds think that We will make them like those who believe and do good - that their life and their death shall be equal? Ill is their judgment!
And Allah created the heavens and the earth with Truth and that every soul may be rewarded for what it has earned and they shall not be wronged.
Have you then considered him who takes his vain desire for his God, and Allah has made him err purposely (or knowingly) and has set a seal upon his ear and his heart (understanding) and put a covering upon his eye. Who can then guide him after Allah? Will you not then be mindful?
And they say, "There is nothing but our life in this world; we live and die and nothing destroys us but time", and they have no knowledge of that; they only conjecture.
And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, their argument is no other than that they say, "Bring our fathers back if you are truthful."
Say, "Allah gives you life, then He makes you die, then will He gather you to the Day of Resurrection wherein is no doubt", but most people know not.
And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and on the Day when the Hour shall come to pass, on that Day shall those who follow falsehoods (illusions) perish.
And you shall see every people (sect, community or nation) kneeling down; every nation shall be called to its Book (or Record, or will be judged by its scripture): this day shall you be requited for what you did.
This is Our book that speaks against you with truth (or justice); surely We cause to be recorded all what you do,
Then as to those who believed and did good, their Lord will make them enter into His mercy; that is the manifest achievement (or triumph).
As to those who disbelieved (it will be said,) "What! Were not Our revelations recited unto you? But you were proud and became a guilty people."
And when it was said, "Surely the promise of Allah is true and as for the Hour, there is no doubt about it", you said, "We do not know what the Hour is; we do not think that it will come to pass save a passing thought, and we are not convinced."
And the evil consequences of what they did shall become manifest to them and that which they mocked shall encompass them.
And it shall be said, "Today We forsake you as you neglected the meeting of this Day of yours and your abode is the Fire, and there are not for you any helpers:
That is because you took the Signs of Allah for a jest and the life of this world deceived you." So on that Day they shall not be brought forth from it, nor shall they be granted Grace.
Therefore to Allah is due all praise, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of all worlds.
And unto Him alone belongs Majesty in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
Ha Mim.
The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.
We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two save with Truth and for an appointed term; and those who disbelieve turn aside from what they are warned of.
Say, "Have you considered what you call upon besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth, or have they a share in the heavens? Bring me a Book before this or traces of knowledge (confirming this), if you are truthful.
And who is in greater error than he who calls besides Allah upon those that will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection and they are heedless of their call?
And when mankind are gathered together they shall be their enemies, and shall be deniers of having been worshipped.
And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who disbelieve say of the truth when it comes to them, "This is mere magic (or sorcery)."
Nay! They say, "He has forged (invented) it." Say, "If I have forged (invented) it, still you do not control anything for me from Allah; He knows best what you utter concerning it; He is enough as a witness between me and you, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."
Say, "I am not the first of (or new thing among) the Messengers, and I do not know what will be done with me or with you: I do not follow anything but that which is revealed to me, and I am nothing but a plain Warner."
Say, "Have you considered :- if it is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to its similarity with earlier Scriptures, and he believed, while you are inflated with pride; surely Allah does not guide unjust people."
And those who disbelieve say concerning those who believe, "If it had been good, they would not have accepted it ahead of us." And as they do not seek to be rightly directed thereby, they say, “It is an old lie".
And before it the Book of Moses was a guide and a mercy: and this is a Book verifying it in the Arabic language that it may warn those who are unjust and as good news for the doers of good.
Surely those who say, "Our Lord is Allah, then they continue on the right way, they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.
These are the dwellers of the Garden, abiding therein: a reward for what they did.
And We have enjoined on man kindness (doing of good) to his parents; with trouble did his mother bear him and with trouble did she bring him forth; and the bearing of him and the weaning of him was thirty months; until when he attains his maturity and reaches forty years, he says, "My Lord! Grant me that I may give thanks for Thy favour which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work righteousness such as that which pleases Thee, and do good to me in respect of my offspring; surely I turn unto Thee, and surely I am of those who Surrender (in Islam).
These are they from whom We accept the best of what they have done and pass over their evil deeds; (they are) among the dwellers of the Garden; the promise of truth which they were promised.
And he who says to his parents, "Fie on you! Do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth when generations have already passed away before me?" And they both (parents) call for Allah's aid, (rebuking their son) "Woe to you! Have faith! Surely the promise of Allah is true." But he says, "This is nothing but stories of the ancients."
These are they against whom the word has proved true among nations of the jinn and mankind that have already passed away before them; surely they are losers.
And for all are degrees according to what they did, and that He may pay them back fully their deeds and they shall not be wronged.
And on the Day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the Fire, (it will be said,) "You did squander your good things in the life of the world and you enjoyed them for a while; now this day you shall be rewarded with the punishment of abasement because you were unjustly proud (disdainful) in the land and because you transgressed.
And mention the brother of A'ad; when he warned his people in the wind-curved sand-hills - and indeed Warners came before him and after him - saying, "Serve none but Allah; surely I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day."
They said, "Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods; then bring upon us that wherewith you threaten us, if you are of the truthful.
He said, "The knowledge is only with Allah, and I deliver to you the message with which I am sent, but I see you are an ignorant people."
So when they saw it (the threat) as a cloud in the sky advancing towards their valleys, they said, "This is a cloud which will give us rain." "Nay! It is (the calamity) which you sought to hasten on, a blast of wind in which is a painful punishment,
"Destroying everything by the command of its Lord." Then by the morning they became such that naught could be seen except (the ruins of) their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty people.
And certainly We had established (empowered, blessed) them in what We have not established (empowered, blessed) you (the Arabs) in, and We had given them (the faculties of) hearing and seeing and feeling, but neither their hearing, nor their seeing, nor their heart availed them aught, since they denied the revelations of Allah, and that which they mocked encompassed them.
And certainly We destroyed the towns which are around you, and We repeat the revelations that they might turn (towards Allah).
Why did not then those help them whom they took for gods besides Allah to draw them nigh (to Him)? Nay! They were lost to them; and this was their lie and what they forged.
And when We turned towards you (O Muhammad) a party of the jinn listened to the Quran; so when they came in its presence (or influence), they said, "Be silent"; then when it was finished, they turned back to their people warning (them).
They said, "O our people! We have listened to a Book revealed after Moses verifying that which is before it, guiding to the truth and to a Straight Way:
"O our people! Accept the Divine Caller and believe in Him, He will forgive you of your faults and protect you from a painful punishment.
And whoever does not accept the Divine Caller, he shall not escape in the earth and he shall not have guardians besides Him, these wander in manifest error."
See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not tired by their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Aye! He has surely power over all things.
And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the Fire, (they will be asked,) "Is it not true?" They shall say, "Aye! By our Lord!" He will say, "Then taste the punishment, because you used to deny (the Truth)."
Therefore persevere patiently (O Muhammad) as did the messengers endowed with constancy, and do not seek to hasten for them (their doom). On the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be as if they had not waited save an hour of the day. A sufficient exposition! Shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people?
Those who disbelieve and turn away (people) from Allah's way; He shall render their works ineffective.
And as for those who believe and do good, and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad - and it is the very truth from their Lord - He will remove their evil from them and improve their condition.
That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and because those who believe follow truth from their Lord. Thus Allah makes their similitudes for mankind.
So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite their necks until when you have overcome them, make them prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favour or let them ransom themselves until the war terminates. That is the command. And if Allah had pleased He could certainly have exacted what is due from them (without you), but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. As for those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish.
He will guide them and improve their condition.
And cause them to enter the Garden which He has made known to them.
O you who believe! If you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you and make firm your feet.
And as for those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective.
That is because they hated what Allah revealed, so He rendered their actions fruitless.
Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen what was the end of those before them? Allah brought down destruction upon them, and the disbelievers shall have the like of it.
That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, and because the rejecters (unbelievers) have no protector.
Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and those who disbelieve enjoy this life and eat even as the beasts eat, and the Fire is their abode.
And how many a town which was far more powerful than your town (Mecca) which has driven you out, did We destroy, so there was no helper for them.
What! Is he who has a clear argument (or relies on clear proof) from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work is made fair-seeming when they follow their own lusts (or low desires)?
A similitude of the Garden which those guarding their duty (to Allah against evil) are promised: therein are rivers of water unpolluted (or incorruptible), and rivers of milk the taste whereof never changes, and rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of honey clarified, and for them therein are all kinds of fruits and Grace from their Lord. (Are these) like those who abide in the Fire and who are made to drink boiling water so it rends their bowels asunder.
And there are those of them who seek to listen to you, until when they go forth from you, they say to those who have been given the knowledge, "What was it that he said just now?" These are they upon whose heart Allah has set a seal and they follow their own lusts (or low desires).
And as for those who follow the right direction, He increases them in guidance and bestows on them their piety and restraint (against evil).
Do they then wait for aught but the Hour that it should come to them of a sudden? But already have come some tokens of it, but how can they take warning when it comes on them?
So know that there is no God but Allah, and, ask protection for your fault and for the believing men and the believing women; and Allah knows the place of your returning and the place of your abiding (or how you move about and how you live).
And those who believe say, "Why has not a chapter been revealed?" But when a decisive chapter is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein, you see those in whose heart is a disease look at you with the look of one fainting because of (fear or approach of) death. Therefore, woe to them!
Obedience and just (or civil, appropriate) words would be proper; but when the affair becomes settled, then if they remain true to Allah it would certainly be better for them.
But if you held command, would you make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship?
These it is whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes.
Do they not then meditate on the Quran or are there locks on the heart?
Surely those who turn their backs after guidance has become manifest to them, Satan has seduced them, and He gives them reign (or Satan gives them false hopes).
That is because they say to those who hate what Allah has revealed, "We will obey you in only some matters." and Allah knows their secrets.
But how will it be when the angels take their souls in death and smite their faces and their backs.
That is because they follow what is displeasing to Allah and are averse to His pleasure, therefore, He has made null their deeds.
Or do those in whose heart is a disease think that Allah will not bring forth their secret faults?
And if We willed We could have made you  (Muhammad) know them so that you would certainly have recognised them by their marks. And you shall certainly recognize them by the intent (tone) of their speech; and Allah knows your deeds.
And most certainly We will try you until We have tested those among you who strive hard, and the steadfast, and made your case manifest.
Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way and oppose the Messenger after that guidance has become clear to them cannot harm Allah in any way, and He will make null their deeds.
O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle, and do not make your actions vain.
Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's way, then they die while they are disbelievers, Allah will by no means forgive them.
And be not faint-hearted, crying for peace, when you should be uppermost, and Allah is with you, and He will not bring your deeds to naught.
The life of this world is only idle sport and pastime, and if you believe and guard (against evil) He will give you your wages, and will not ask of you your possessions. 
If He should ask you for it and urge you, you will be niggardly, and He will bring forth your ill feelings.
Behold! You are those who are called upon to spend in Allah's way, but among you are those who are niggardly (or hoard), and whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own soul; and Allah is the Rich (Self-sufficient) and you are the poor (having need of Him), and if you turn back He will bring in your place another people, and they will not be like you.
Surely We have given to you a clear victory
That Allah may forgive your community their past faults and those to come, and complete His favour to you and keep you on a Straight Way,
And that Allah might help you with powerful help.
He it is Who sent down tranquillity into the heart of the believers that they might have more of faith added to their faith - for Allah's are the hosts (forces) of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Knowing, Wise - 
That He may cause the believing men and the believing women to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein, and remove from them their evil; and that, in the sight of Allah, is the supreme achievement (or triumph) -
And that He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who entertain evil thoughts about Allah. For them is the evil turn of fortune, and Allah is wroth with them and has cursed them and prepared Hell for them, an evil destination.
Allah's are the hosts (or forces) of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Surely We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness and as a bearer of good news and as a Warner,
That you (mankind) may believe in Allah and His Messenger and may aid Him and revere Him; and that you may declare His glory, morning and evening.
Surely those who swear allegiance unto you (O Muhammad) do but swear allegiance to Allah; the hand of Allah is above their hands. Therefore, whoever breaks his faith, he breaks it only to the injury of his own soul, and whoever fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah, He will grant him a mighty reward.
Those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind will say to you, "Our property and our families kept us busy, so ask forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues what is not in their heart. Say, "Then who can control anything for you from Allah if He intends to do you harm or if He intends to do you good. Nay, Allah is Aware of what you do:
"Nay! You rather thought that the messenger and the believers would not ever return to their families, and this was made fair-seeming to your heart, and you thought an evil thought and you were a worthless people."
And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger - Lo! We have prepared a blazing Fire for the disbelievers.
And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Those who are left behind will say when you set forth to capture booty, "Allow us to follow you." They fain would change the verdict of Allah. Say, "By no means shall you follow us; thus did Allah say before." But they will say, "Nay! You are envious of us." Nay! They understand but a little.
Say to those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind: "You shall soon be invited to fight against a people possessing mighty prowess; you will fight against them or they will submit; then if you obey, Allah will grant you a good reward; and if you turn back as you turned back before, He will punish you with a painful doom."
There is no blame for the blind, nor is there any blame for the lame, nor is there any blame for the sick if they do not go forth to war; and whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle, He will cause him to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and whoever turns back, He will punish him with a painful doom.
Certainly Allah's Good Pleasure was on the believers when they swore allegiance unto you  under the tree, and He knew what was in their heart, so He sent down peace (or tranquillity) on them and rewarded them with a near victory,
And many gains which they will acquire; and Allah is Mighty, Wise.
Allah promised you many gains which you will acquire, then He has given you this one as a foretaste and restrained the hands of men from you, that it may be a sign for the believers and that He may guide you on a Straight Way.
And other gains which are not yet within your power (or have not been able to achieve), Allah will encompassed them, and Allah has power over all things.
And if those who disbelieve fight with you, they would certainly turn their backs, then they would not find any protector or helper.
Such has been the course (or practice or law) of Allah that has indeed run also in the past, and you shall find no power to change this course (or law) of Allah.
And He it is Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had given you victory over them; and Allah is Seeing what you do.
It is they who disbelieved and turned you away from the Sacred Mosque and prevented the offering from reaching its destined place. Were it not for the believing men and the believing women (in Mecca), whom you knew not that you were trampling, thereby incurring guilt for yourselves on their account unknowingly (He would have allowed the war). (But he held you back) so that Allah may bring into His mercy whom He will. Had they been clearly separated one from another, We would surely have punished those who disbelieved from among them with a painful doom.
When those who disbelieved harboured in their heart feelings of agitation and disdain - the agitation and disdain of the Days of Ignorance - Allah sent down His tranquillity on His Messenger and on the believers, and made them adhere to the Word (or command) of self-restraint, and they were entitled to it and worthy of it; and Allah is Aware of all things.
Truly Allah had shown to His Messenger the vision: you shall most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, in security, some with shaved heads and others with cut hair, fearless. But He knows what you do not know, and He has given you a near victory beforehand.
He it is Who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true religion that He may make it prevail over all the religions; and Allah is enough for a witness.
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those with him are firm of heart against the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves; you will see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, seeking grace from Allah and His Good Pleasure; their marks are in their faces because of the effect of prostration; that is their similitude in the Torah (Numbers 16:22); and their similitude in the Gospels (Mark 4:27-28) is like a sown corn-seed that puts forth its sprout, then strengthens it, so it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the unbelievers on account of them; Allah has promised those among them who believe and do good, forgiveness and a great reward.
O you who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His Apostle, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and do not speak loud to him as you speak loud to one another, lest your deeds became null while you do not perceive.
Surely those who lower their voices before Allah's Messenger are they whose heart Allah has proved for righteousness (or guarding against evil); they shall have forgiveness and a great reward.
As for those who call out to you from behind the private apartments, surely most of them understand not.
And if they wait patiently until you come out to them, it would certainly be better for them, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! If an evil-doer comes to you with a report, look carefully into it (do not ignore it because he is evil), lest you harm a people in ignorance, then be sorry for what you have done.
And know that among you is Allah's Messenger; should he obey you in many a matter, you would surely fall into distress, but Allah has endeared the faith to you and has made it seemly in your heart, and He has made hateful to you disbelief and transgression and disobedience; these it is that walk in righteousness,
It is a grace and a favour from Allah; and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And if two parties of the believers quarrel, make peace between them; but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then fight you all against the one which transgresses until it returns to the commands of Allah; then if it returns, make peace between them with justice and act equitably; surely Allah loves those who are equitable.
The believers are naught else but brethren, therefore make peace between your brethren and be careful of your duty to Allah that mercy may be had on you.
O you who believe! Let not one people deride (or ridicule) another people perchance they may be better than they, nor let women deride other women, perchance they may be better than they; and do not find fault with (or defame) your own people nor insult one another by (offensive) nicknames; evil is a bad name after faith, and whoever does not desist, these it is that are the unjust.
O you who believe! Avoid most of suspicion, for surely suspicion in some cases is a sin, and do not spy nor let some of you backbite others. Does one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? But you abhor it; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, surely Allah is Oft relenting, Merciful.
O mankind! Surely We have created you male and female (or from a single pair), and made you tribes and families that you may know each other; surely the most noble of you with Allah is the one among you most righteous (careful of his duty to Allah); surely Allah is Knowing, Aware.
The dwellers of the desert (or desert Arabs) say, "We believe". Say, "You believe not, but rather say, 'We submit'; for faith has not yet entered into your heart; and if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not diminish aught of your deeds; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
Only they are the believers who believe in Allah and His Messenger, then afterwards they doubt not and struggle hard with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah; they are the truthful (sincere or righteous) ones.
Say, "What! Will you teach Allah about your religion?" Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and Allah is Aware of all things.
They think that they do you (Muhammad) a favour by their Surrender (by becoming Muslims). Say, "Deem not your Surrender (Islam) a favour unto me; nay, It is Allah who has conferred a favour unto you, in as much as He has led you to the Faith, if you are earnest.
Lo! Allah knows the unseen things of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Seer of what you do.
Qaf. I swear by the glorious Quran (that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.)
Nay! They wonder that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves, so the unbelievers say, " This is a wonderful thing.
"What! When we are dead and have become dust (shall we live again)? That is a far return (or far from probable or from our understanding)."
We know indeed what the earth diminishes (or takes) from them (excreta or dead bodies), and with Us is a Preserved Record (or the record is preserved).
Nay, they rejected the truth when it came to them, so they are now in a state of confusion.
Do they not then look up to heaven above them how We have made it and adorned it and it has no gaps (rifts or flaws)?
And the earth, We have made it plain and cast in it mountains and We have made to grow therein of all beautiful kinds,
As a vision (observation or spectacle) and a reminder to every penitent servant (for his delight or awe and instruction).
And We send down from the cloud water abounding in good (or blessings), then We cause to grow therewith gardens and the grain that is reaped,
And the lofty palm-trees with fruit spikes closely set one above another,
A sustenance for the servants (of Allah), and We give life thereby to a dead land; thus is the Resurrection.
Others before them rejected (these ideas or the Prophets): the people of Noah and the dwellers of Ar-Rass and Thamud,
And A'ad and Pharaoh and Lot's brethren,
And the dwellers of the Wood (Midian) and the people of Tubba; all rejected the messengers. Therefore, My threat came to pass.
Were We then fatigued with (did We need rest after) the first creation? Yet are they in doubt with regard to a new creation.
And certainly We created man, and We know what his soul suggests to him, and We are nearer to him than his life-vein (Jugular and Carotid).
When the two Receivers receive him, sitting on the right and on the left.
He utters not a word but there is by him a watcher (sentinel, one who censors) at hand.
And the stupor of death will bring truth; that is what you were trying to escape.
And the Trumpet shall be blown; that is the day about which warning had been given.
And every soul shall come, with it a Driver and a Witness.
Certainly you were heedless of it, but now We have removed from you your veil, and piercing is your sight this day.
And his companions (the Driver and the Witness) shall say, "Here (his Record) is ready with me.
"So cast into Hell every ungrateful, rebellious one,
"Forbidder of good, exceeder of limits, doubter,
"Who sets up another God with Allah; cast him into severe chastisement."
His companion will say, "Our Lord! I did not lead him into transgression but he himself was in great error."
He will say, "Do not quarrel in My presence, and indeed I gave you the warning beforehand:
"My word shall not be changed, nor am I in the least unjust to My servants."
On the day that We will say to Hell, "Are you filled up?” And it will say, "Are there any more?"
And the Garden shall be brought near to those who guard against evil, not far off:
This is what you were promised, (it is) for every one who turned (to Allah or was repentant), and kept His limits (or Law);
Who fears the Beneficent One in secret (or unseen or inwardly) and comes with a penitent (or devoted) heart:
"Enter you therein in peace, this is the day of Eternal Life (or Immortality)."
They have therein all that they wish and with Us is even more.
And how many a generation did We destroy before them who were mightier in prowess than they. Then they wander through (or overrun) the land; but was there for them a place of refuge (when the Judgment came)?
Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or he gives ear and is a witness (or understands intelligently).
And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods and there touched Us not any fatigue (Allah required no rest).
Therefore be patient of what they say, and sing the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting.
And glorify Him in the night and after the prescribed prostrations.
And listen for the Day when the Caller shall cry from a near place.
The Day when they shall hear the Call (or Cry or Blast) in truth; that is the day of coming forth.
Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the final destination (or goal).
The day on which the earth shall be rent asunder from under them, they will hasten forth; that will be a gathering together easy to Us.
We know best what they say, and you (O Muhammad) are not one to compel them; but admonish by means of the Quran him who fears My warning.
(I swear) By the wind that scatters far and wide,
And those that lift and bear heavy loads,
And those that flow with ease and gentleness,
And those that distribute and apportion by Our command;
That of which you are warned is most surely true,
And the judgment must most surely come about.
Swear by the heaven (sky) full of paths (orbits).
Most surely you are in doctrines (opinions, teachings, ideologies) discordant (or inconsistent or contradictory),
He is turned away by them from truth, who would be (or wishes to be) turned away.
Cursed be the conjecturers (or lie-mongers),
Who flounder heedless in an abyss (of ignorance and confusion).
They ask, "When will be the day of judgment?"
It is the day on which they shall be tried at the Fire.
Taste you your torment! This is what you sought to hasten.
Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in Gardens and Springs.
Taking joy in what their Lord gives them; surely they were before that, the doers of good.
They used to sleep but little in the night.
And in the morning they prayed for forgiveness.
And in their wealth a portion was allotted for him who asked (the needy) and to him who was denied (the outcast, the deprived person or the one who could not ask).
And in the earth there are signs for those who have sure faith,
And also in your own souls; will you not then see?
And in the heaven is your sustenance and that which you are promised.
And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth! It is most surely the truth, even as you speak.
Has there come to you information about the honoured guests of Abraham?
When they entered his presence they said, "Peace. Peace." Said he, "What a strange people."
Then he turned aside to his family secretly and brought a fat (roasted) calf,
And placed it before them. He said, "What! Will you not eat?"
(When they did not eat) he conceived in his mind a fear of them. They said, "Fear not." And they gave him the good news of a son endowed with knowledge.
Then his wife came up in great grief, and she struck her face and said, "An old barren woman!"
They said, "Thus says your Lord: Surely He is the Wise, the Knowing."
He said, "What is your errand then, O Messengers!"
They said, "Surely we are sent to a guilty people,
"That we may send down upon them stone of clay (or brimstones),
"Sent forth from your Lord for the extravagant (those who transgress beyond bounds)."
Then We brought forth such believers as were therein.
But We found not therein but one house of those who had Surrendered (Muslims).
And We left therein a sign for those who fear the grievous penalty.
And in Moses (was another sign). When We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority.
But he turned away with his forces and said, "A sorcerer or a mad man."
So We seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the sea and his was the blame.
And in A'ad (was another sign). When We sent upon them the destructive wind.
It spared naught on which it blew, but made it like dust.
And in Thamud (was another sign). When it was said to them, "Enjoy yourselves for a while."
But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord, so the rumbling (thunderbolt or stunning noise of an earthquake) overtook them while they looked.
And they were not able to rise up, nor could they defend themselves.
And the people of Noah (were also a sign) before that, surely they were a transgressing people.
And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and it is We that expand the vastness of space (or We are the expanders of it).
And the earth, We have spread it out; how gracious was the Spreader thereof.
And of all things have We created pairs, that you may reflect (or receive instruction).
Therefore flee unto Allah, surely I am a plain Warner to you from Him.
And set not up with Allah another God: surely I am a plain Warner to you from Him.
Thus there did not come to those before them a messenger but they said, "(He is) A sorcerer or a mad man."
Is this the legacy (or tradition) they have transmitted to each other? Nay! They are a people extravagant (transgressing beyond bounds).
Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame;
And continue to teach (or remind), for surely the reminder profits the believers.
And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship (serve) Me.
No sustenance do I require from them, nor do I require that they should feed Me.
Surely it is Allah Who is the Bestower of sustenance, the Lord of Power, the ever Steadfast.
And lo! Those who do wrong shall have a portion like the portion of those of earlier generations, therefore let them not ask Me to hasten.
Woe to those who disbelieve because of their Day which they are promised.
(I swear) By the Mount,
By a Decree inscribed
On a fine parchment, unrolled
And the much visited House,
And the canopy exalted,
And the swollen sea,
Most surely the doom of your Lord will come to pass;
There shall be none to avert it;
On the day when the heaven shall heave with awful commotion,
And the mountains shall move with awful movement.
Then woe on that Day unto the deniers (of the truth),
Those who sport in vain discourses.
The Day on which they shall be driven irresistibly to the Fire of Hell.
This is the Fire which you used to deny.
Is it magic then, or do you not see?
Burn you therein, and whether you bear it patiently or not, it makes no difference; you shall be requited only what you did.
Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in Gardens of Bliss,
Rejoicing because of what their Lord gave them, and their Lord saved them from the punishment of the burning Fire.
Eat and drink with profit and health because of what you did,
Reclining on thrones set in ranks, and We will unite them to large-eyed beautiful ones (Houri).
And as for those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, We will unite with them their offspring and We will not deprive them of naught of their work; each individual is a pledge for his own deeds.
And We will provide them with fruit and flesh such as they desire.
They shall pass from one to another a cup wherein there shall be nothing vain nor any sin.
And round them shall serve youth devoted to them, handsome as well-guarded (preserved or hidden) pearls.
And some of them shall draw near unto others, inquiring,
Saying, "Surely in the past we feared for our families:
"But Allah has been gracious to us and He has saved us from the punishment of the Scorching Wind:
"Surely we called upon Him before: Surely He is the Benign, the Merciful."
Therefore continue you (O Muhammad) to remind (or warn), for by the grace of your Lord, you are not a soothsayer, or a madman.
Or do they say, " (he is) A poet, for whom we await a calamity of (or an accident of or caused by) time"?
Say, "Wait (expect) ye! I too with you am waiting (expecting)."
Nay! Do their understandings bid them this? Or are they a people transgressing beyond bounds?
Or do they say, "He has forged it." Nay! They will not believe.
Then let them bring an announcement (or recital) like it if they are truthful.
Or were they created out of nothing, or are they themselves the creators?
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay! They have no certainty.
Or have they the treasures of your Lord with them? Or have they been set in absolute authority?
Or have they a ladder (unto heaven) the means by which they listen? Then let their listener bring a clear authority.
Or has He daughters while you have sons?
Or do you ask them for a reward, so that they are overburdened by a debt?
Or have they the unseen so that they write it down?
Or do they desire to plot (or ensnare)? But those who disbelieve shall be the vanquished in their plot.
Or have they a God other than Allah? Glory be to Allah from what they set up (with Him).
And if they should see a portion of the heaven coming down, they would say, "Piled up clouds."
Leave them then till they meet that Day of theirs wherein they shall be made to swoon (with terror):
The day on which their struggle shall not avail them aught, nor shall they be helped.
And surely those who are unjust shall have a punishment besides that (in the world), but most of them understand not.
And wait patiently for the decree (command, judgment) of your Lord, for verily you are in Our eyes; and hymn the praise of your Lord when you rise;
And in the night, give Him glory too, and at the retreat of the stars.
(I swear) By the star when it sets.
Your companion (Muhammad) does not err, nor is he deceived (or astray or is misled);
Nor does he speak out of (his own) desire.
It (the Quran) is naught but revelation that is inspired (sent down to him);
Taught by one of mighty power, (The Archangel Gabriel)
Endowed with wisdom; for he appeared in clear vision,
While he was in the highest part of the horizon.
Then he drew near, and descended
Until he was two bows distant or closer still.
And He revealed to His servant what He revealed.
The heart (of the Prophet) lied not in (making him see) what he saw.
What! Do you then dispute with him as to what he saw?
And certainly he saw him in another descent,
At the Lote-tree of the furthest boundary;
Near which is the Garden of Abode (or Presence),
When that which shrouds (in mystery) covered the Lote-tree;
The eye did not swerve, nor did it exceed the limit (or was over bold or went wrong).
Certainly he saw of the Greatest Signs of his Lord.
Have you seen Lat and Uzza,
And Manat, the third, the last?
What! For you the males and for Him the females!
This indeed is an unjust division!
They are naught but names which you have named, you and your fathers; Allah has not sent for them any authority. They follow naught but conjecture and the low desires which their souls incline to, even though true guidance has come to them from their Lord.
Or shall man have whatever whims he wishes?
Nay! To Allah belongs the after and the former life (or the End and the Beginning).
And how many so ever angels are in the heavens, their intercession does not avail at all except after Allah has given permission to whom He wills and chooses to accept.
Most surely they who do not believe in the Hereafter name the angels with female names.
And they have no knowledge of it; they do not follow anything but conjecture, and surely conjecture does not avail against the truth at all.
Therefore, turn aside from him who turns his back upon Our reminder (or remembrance) and does not desire anything but the life of this world.
That is their sum of knowledge; surely your Lord knows best him who goes astray from His path and He knows best him who follows the right direction.
And to Allah belongs that which is in the heavens and that which is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and that He may reward those who do good with goodness.
Those who keep aloof from the great sins and the indecencies, except the passing idea (or the unwilling or small offence); surely your Lord is liberal in forgiving. He knows you best when He brings you forth from the earth and when you are embryos in the wombs of your mothers; therefore attribute not purity to your souls (or justify not yourselves); He knows best who it is who guards himself against evil.
Have you then seen him who turns his back?
And gives a little and then withholds.
Has he the knowledge of the unseen so that he can see (the future or the hidden)?
Or, has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Moses?
And of Abraham who fulfilled (the commandments or duties):
That no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another,
And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for,
And that his striving shall be seen.
Then shall he be rewarded for it with the fullest reward;
And that your Lord is the final goal;
And that He it is Who makes men laugh and makes them weep;
And that He it is Who causes death and gives life;
And that He created pairs, the male and the female
From the small seed when it is placed (or lodged);
And that on Him depends (or He has ordained) the bringing forth a second time;
And that He it is Who enriches and gives satisfaction (or fulfilment);
And that He is the Lord of Sirius;
And that He did destroy the A'ad of old
And Thamud He spared not
And the people of Noah before them; surely they were most unjust and insolent transgressors;
And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah),
So that they were covered with that which covers.
Then about which of your Lord's gifts will you dispute?
This is a Warner of (the series or like) the Warners of old.
The threatened event (or Hour) draws nigh.
There is none besides Allah to disclose (or actualise) it.
Marvel you then at this announcement?
And will you laugh and not weep?
While you are indulging in vanities.
So make obeisance (or prostrations) to Allah and serve Him.
The hour drew nigh (or is nigh) and the moon was rent in twain (or is rent).
And if they see a Sign they turn aside and say, "Transient magic."
And they call it a lie, and follow their own low desires; but every affair has its appointed term.
And certainly some narratives have come to them wherein is a deterrent, 
Consummate wisdom - but warnings avail not;
So turn your back on them for the Day when the Summoner summons them unto a terrible affair,
With downcast eyes, they come forth from their graves as if they were scattered locusts,
Hastening towards the Summoner. The unbelievers shall say, "This is a hard day."
Before them the people of Noah rejected, yea they reject Our servant and called him mad, and he was driven away.
Therefore he called upon his Lord, "I am overcome, come you then to help."
So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth
And We caused water to gush forth from the land in springs; so the waters gathered together and rose according to a measure already ordained.
And We bore him on that (the Ark) which was made of planks and nails (or ties of palm-fibre)
Floating before Our eyes, a reward for him who was rejected.
And certainly We left it as a sign, but is there anyone that remembers (or takes heed).
How great was then My punishment after My warning!
And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed?
A'ad treated the truth as a lie, so how great was My punishment after My warning!
Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of violent disaster,
Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of palm-trees uprooted.
How great was then My punishment after My warning!
And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed?
Thamud rejected the warning.
So they said, "What! A single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? Most surely we shall then be in sure error and madness:
"Can it be that the reminder has been sent to him of all the people among us? Nay! He is an insolent liar!"
Ah, tomorrow shall they know who is the liar, the insolent one.
Surely We shall send them the she-camel as a trial; therefore, watch them and have patience.
And inform them that the water is to be shared between them; every drinking shall be regulated.
But they called their companion, who took (the sword) and hamstrung her.
How great was then My punishment after My warning!
Surely We sent upon them a single Shout (or Blast), so they became like the dry stubble which the maker of an enclosure collects.
And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed?
The people of Lot treated the warning. as a lie. 
Surely We sent upon them a storm with stones, except Lot's followers; We saved them a little before daybreak,
A favour from Us; thus do We reward him who gives thanks.
And certainly he (Lot) warned them of Our violent punishment, but they obstinately disputed the warning.
And they endeavoured to snatch away his guests from him, but We blinded their eyes; "So taste you My chastisement and My warning.
And early in the morning a lasting chastisement overtook them.
"So taste you My chastisement after My warning."
And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed?
And certainly the warning came to Pharaoh's people.
They rejected all Our Signs, so We overtook them with such a penalty as comes from One Mighty, Powerful.
Are the unbelievers of yours (O Quraish) better than these, or is there an exemption for you in the Sacred Books?
Or do they say, "We are a host allied together to help each other?
But soon shall the hosts be routed, and they shall flee.
Nay, the Hour is their promised time, and the Hour shall be most grievous and bitter.
Surely it is the guilty who are in error and madness.
On the day when they shall be dragged upon their faces into the Fire, "Taste the touch of hell."
Surely We have created everything according to a measure.
And Our command is but one, as the twinkling of an eye.
And certainly We have already destroyed the likes of you, but is there anyone who will heed?
And everything they did is in the Scriptures (or the Record).
And everything small and great is recorded.
Surely the righteous (who guard against evil) shall dwell among Gardens and Rivers,
Established in the Assembly of Truth in the presence of an Omnipotent Sovereign.
The Beneficent Allah,
Taught (Has made known) the Quran.
He created man,
Taught him speech (language, modes of expression and communication).
The sun and the moon follow courses (exactly) reckoned (in space and time).
And the stars (or herds of animals) and the trees do adore (Him).
And the heaven, He raised it high, and He made the Balance (or set the measure),
That you may not exceed the measure (or transgress beyond limits).
But keep the measure strictly (with justice or equity) nor fall short of it (or be deficient in measuring).
And the earth, has He set out for (His) creatures;
Therein is fruit and palms having sheathed clusters,
And the grain with its husk and fragrant herbs.
Which then of the bounties (favours, gifts)) of your Lord will you deny?
He created man from dry clay like earthen vessels (as containers),
And He created the jinn of a flame of (or of smokeless) fire.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
He is the Lord of the two Easts and Lord of the two Wests.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
He has made the two seas (streams or bodies of water, salt and sweet) to flow freely so that they meet together:
Between them is a barrier which they do not transgress.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
There come forth from them pearls and coral.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
And His are the ships reared aloft in the sea like mountains.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
All that is therein (on earth) must pass away.
And there remains naught but the Countenance of your Lord of Might and Glory (or of Majesty and Nobility (Bounty and Honour)).
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
All those who are in the heavens and the earth entreat (or need) Him; every moment is He in a (new?) state of Glory (or wields universal power).
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Soon will We apply Ourselves to you, O you two worlds (men and jinn or outer and inner, manifest and hidden).
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
O assembly of the jinn and the men! If you are able to pass through the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass through; you cannot pass through but with authority.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
The flames of fire (to burn) and smoke (to choke) will be sent on you two, then you will have no defence.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
And when the heaven is rent asunder and then becomes red like red hide. 
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
So on that day neither man nor jinn shall be asked about his sin.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
The guilty shall be recognized by their marks, so they shall be seized by the forelocks and the feet.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
This is the hell which the guilty called a lie.
They go circling between it and hot, boiling water.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
And for him who fears to stand before his Lord are two Gardens.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Containing in them various kinds (trees and delights).
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
In both of them are two fountains (or streams) flowing.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
In both of them are two pairs of every fruit. 
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Reclining on beds, the inner coverings of which are of silk brocade; and the fruits of the two gardens shall be within reach.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
In them shall be those who are chaste with restrained glances; whom neither man nor jinn shall have touched before them.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
As though they were rubies and corals (or pearls).
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Is the reward of goodness other than goodness?
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
And besides these two are two other Gardens:
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Both dark-green in colour (the colour of foliage well watered).
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
In both of them are two springs gushing forth.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
In both are fruits and date-palms and pomegranates.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
In them are goodly things and beautiful ones.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Pure ones confined to pavilions.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Man has not touched them before them nor jinn.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Reclining on green cushions and rich carpets of beauty.
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?
Blessed be the name of your Lord, Mighty and Glorious!
When the Inevitable Event comes to pass -
There is no denying that it will come -
Abasing some, exalting others.
When the earth shall be shaken to its foundations,
And the mountains shall be crumbled, 
So that they shall be as scattered dust.
And you shall be sorted into three classes,
First the companions of the right hand - what will be the companions of the right hand?
And then the companions of the left hand - what will be the companions of the left hand?
And those foremost (in faith) will be the foremost (in the Hereafter),
These are they who are drawn nigh (to Allah),
In the Gardens of Bliss.
A multitude of those of old,
And a few of those of later times.
On thrones decorated,
Reclining on them, facing one another.
Round about them shall serve youths of permanent freshness (immortal or never altering in age),
With goblets and ewers and a cup filled from a pure fountain;
They shall not suffer with headache thereby, nor shall they get intoxicated (or exhausted),
And fruits such as they choose,
And the flesh of fowl and any as they desire.
And pure, beautiful companions,
The like of the well-preserved pearls:
A reward for what they used to do.
They shall not hear therein vain or sinful discourse,
Except the saying, "Peace! Peace!"
And the companions of the right hand; what of the companions of the Right Hand!
Amid thornless Lote-trees,
And tall trees with clusters of flowers (or fruits) one above another.
And spreading shade,
And water flowing constantly,
And abundant fruit,
Neither intercepted nor forbidden,
And exalted thrones.
Surely We have created them into a new creation,
And made them virgins pure,
Loving friends, equals in age,
For the sake of the companions of the right hand.
A multitude of those of old,
And a multitude of those of later times.
And those of the left hand; what of those of the Left Hand?
In hot wind and boiling water,
And the shade of black smoke,
Neither cool nor honourable.
Surely they were before this made to live in ease and plenty.
And they persisted in the great violation (or great sin).
And they used to say, "What! When we die and have become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised?
"Or our fathers of yore?"
Say, "The first and the last,
"Shall most surely be gathered together for the appointed hour of a known day.
"Then shall you, O you who err and call it a lie!
"Most surely eat of a tree of Zaqqum,
"And fill your bellies therewith;
"Then drink over it boiling water;
"And drink as drinks the thirsty camel."
This is their entertainment on the Day of Requital.
We have created you, why do you not then assent?
Have you considered the seed (or what you emit)?
Is it you that create it or are We the creators?
We have ordained death among you and We are not to be frustrated,
That We may transfigure you and make you grow into what you know not.
And certainly you know the first growth, why do you not then reflect?
Have you considered what you sow?
Is it you that cause it to grow, or are We the cause.
If We willed, We could crumble it to powder, then would you lament,
"Surely we are burdened with debt;
"Nay! We are deprived."
Have you considered the water which you drink?
Is it you that send it down from the clouds, or are We the senders?
If We willed, We could have made it salty; why do you not then give thanks?
Have you considered the fire which you strike?
Is it you that produce the trees for it, or are We the producers?
We have made it a reminder and a convenience for the dwellers of the deserts.
Therefore, glorify the name of your Lord, the Supreme.
But nay! I swear by the setting (or falling or fading) of stars;
And most surely it is a very great oath if you only knew;
Most surely it is an honoured Quran,
In a book that is protected
None shall touch it save the purified ones.
A revelation by the Lord of the worlds.
Do you then hold this announcement in contempt?
And make denial of it your means of subsistence.
Why then do you not (intervene) when the soul comes up to the throat (of a dying person),
And you the while look on -
And We are nearer to it (the soul) than you, but you see not - 
Then why, if you are not under Our authority,
Force back (the soul), if you are truthful (about your independence)?
Then if he is one of those Near to Allah,
(There is for him) Satisfaction and Bounty and a Garden of Bliss.
And if he is one of those on the Right Hand,
Then (the salutation) "Peace to you” from the companions of the Right Hand.
And if he is one of the rejecters, the erring ones,
He shall have an entertainment of boiling water,
And burning in Hell.
Most surely this is a certain truth (or the Truth of Certainty).
Therefore glorify the name of your Lord, the Supreme.
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares the glory of Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and causes death; and He has power over all things.
He is the First and the Last and the Evident (or Outer) and the Imminent (or Hidden or Inner), and He is Aware of all things.
He it is who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, then He firmly established Himself on the Throne (of authority); He knows that which goes deep down into the earth and that which comes forth out of it, and that which comes down from the heaven and that which goes up into it, and He is with you wherever you are; and Allah is Seer of what you do.
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah are (all) affairs returned.
He causes the night to enter in upon the day, and causes the day to enter in upon the night, and He is Aware of what is in the heart.
Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend out of what He has made you heirs (or trustees); for those of you who believe and spend shall have a great reward.
And what reasons have you that you should not believe in Allah? And the Messenger calls on you that you may believe in your Lord, and indeed He has made a covenant with you if you are believers.
He it is who sends down clear revelations upon His servant, that he may bring you forth from darkness into light; and lo! For you Allah is most Kind, Merciful.
And what reason have you that you should not spend in Allah's way? For Allah's is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. Not alike among you are those who spent and fought before the victory (and those who did not): they are more exalted in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all has Allah promised good; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Who is there that will offer to Allah a goodly loan that He may double it (or increase it many fold) for him, and he shall have an excellent reward?
On that day you will see the faithful men and the faithful women, their light shining forth before them and on their right hand, (and it will be said,) "Good news for you this day: Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein," That is the supreme achievement.
On the day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say to those who believe, "Wait for us, that we may borrow a light from your light"; it shall be said, "Turn back and seek a light." Then there will separate them a wall having a door in it, whereof the inner side contains mercy, while the outer side faces wrath and doom.
They will cry unto them, "Were we not with you?" They shall say, "Yea! But you caused yourselves to fall into temptation, and you waited and doubted, and vain desires deceived you till the ordinance (punishment) of Allah came, while the Arch-deceiver deceived you about Allah."
So today ransom shall not be accepted from you nor from those who disbelieved; your abode is the Fire; it is your patron and evil is the destination.
Has not the time ripe for those who believe that their heart should submit to the remembrance (or the Reminder) of Allah and to what has been revealed of the truth? And that they should not become like those who were given the Book before, but the term was prolonged for them, and so their heart hardened, and most of them are rebellious transgressors.
Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death; indeed, We have made the revelations clear to you that you may understand.
Surely the charitable men and the charitable women and those who set apart for Allah a goodly portion, it shall be doubled for them and they shall have a noble reward.
And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers, these it is that are the truthful and the faithful ones in the sight of their Lord: they shall have their reward and their light, and as for those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations, these are the inmates of Hell.
Know that the life of this world is only sport and play and idle talk and boasting among yourselves, and a rivalry in the multiplication of wealth and children; like the vegetation after rain, whereof the growth pleases the husbandmen; but then it withers away so that you will see it become yellow, then it becomes dried up and crumbles away; but in the Hereafter is a severe chastisement and also forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure; and the life of this world is naught but means of deception.
Hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and to a Garden the extensiveness of which is as the extensiveness of the heaven and the earth; it is prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers; that is the grace of Allah: He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.
No evil (or disaster) befalls on the earth nor in your own souls, but it is in a Book before We bring it into existence; surely that is easy to Allah:
So that you may not grieve for what has escaped you, nor be exultant at what He has given you; and Allah does not love any arrogant boaster,
Those who are niggardly (or hoard) and enjoin niggardliness (or avarice) on men; and whoever turns back, then surely Allah is He Who is the Absolute (Self-sufficient), the Owner of Praise.
Certainly We sent Our messengers with clear arguments, and sent down with them the Book and the Balance that men may conduct themselves with equity; and We have sent down Iron, wherein is mighty power (or War) and advantages to men, and that Allah may know who helps Him and His messengers in secret (unseen or in his heart); surely Allah is Strong, Mighty.
And certainly We sent Noah and Abraham and We gave to their offspring the gift of prophecy and the Book; so there are among them those who go aright, but most of them are transgressors.
Then We made Our Messengers to follow in their footsteps, and We sent Jesus, son of Mary afterwards, and We bestowed on him the Gospel, and We put in the heart of those who followed him kindness and mercy; but monkery (or monasticism), they invented it - We did not prescribe it for them - (We commanded) only the seeking of Allah's pleasure, but they did not observe it with its due observance; so We gave to those of them who believed their reward, but most of them are transgressors.
O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah and believe in His Messengers: He will give you two portions of His mercy, and provide for you a Light with which you will walk, and forgive you, for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful;
So that the followers of the Book may know that they do not control aught of the grace of Allah, and that Grace is in Allah's hand. He gives it to whom He pleases; and Allah is the Lord of abundant Grace.
Allah indeed knows the plea of her who pleads with you (Muhammad) about her husband and carries her complaint to Allah, and Allah knows the contentions of both sides; surely Allah is Hearing, Seeing.
Those of you who divorce their wives by Zihar (likening them to the backs of their mothers), they are not their mothers; their mothers are no others than those who gave them birth; and most surely they utter a hateful word and a falsehood and lo! Allah is He Who blots out (past wrongs), and is oft Forgiving.
But if those who divorce their wives by Zihar and then wish to recall what they said, they should free a captive (slave) before they touch each other; to this are you admonished to conform; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
But whoever has not the means, let him fast for two successive months before they touch each other. And as for him who is unable to do so, let him feed sixty needy ones. This is in order that you may have faith in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits imposed by Allah, and the disbelievers shall have a painful punishment.
Surely those who act in opposition to Allah and His Messenger shall be abased even as those before them were abased; and indeed We have revealed clear revelations, and the unbelievers shall have a shameful doom.
On the day when Allah will raise them up all together, He will inform them of what they did: Allah has recorded it while they have forgotten it; and Allah is a witness of all things.
Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth? Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the fourth of them, nor between five but He is the sixth of them, nor less than that nor more but He is with them wherever they are; then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection: surely Allah is Aware of all things.
Have you not seen those who are forbidden secret counsels, then they return to what they are forbidden, and they hold secret counsels for sin and revolt and disobedience to the Messenger, and when they come to you they greet you with a greeting with which Allah does not greet you, and they say in themselves, "Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?" Hell is enough for them; they shall enter it, and evil is the resort.
O you who believe! When you confer together in private, do not give to each other counsel of sin and revolt and disobedience to the Messenger, and give to each other counsel of goodness and self-restraint against evil; and be careful of your duty to Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered.
Secret counsels are only the work of Satan that he may cause to grief to those who believe, and he cannot hurt them in the least except with Allah's permission, and on Allah let the believers rely.
O you who believe! When it is said to you, "Make room in your assemblies," then make ample room, Allah will give you ample, and when it is said, "Rise up," then rise up. Allah will exalt those of you who believe and those who are given knowledge, to high degrees; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
O you who believe! When you consult the Messenger, then offer something in charity before your consultation; that is better for you and purer; but if you find not the means, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Do you fear that you will not be able to give in charity before your consultation? Then, if you do it not and Allah has forgiven you (or been merciful to you), then (at least) keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and obey Allah and His Apostle; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Have you not seen those who befriend a people with whom Allah is wroth? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear to falsehood knowingly.
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment; surely what they do is evil.
They make their oaths to serve as a cover so they turn away from Allah's way; therefore they shall have a shameful doom.
Neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them aught against Allah; they are the inmates of the Fire, therein they shall abide.
On the day that Allah will raise them up all, then they will swear to Him as they swear to you, and they think that they have something (to stand upon); now surely they are the liars.
The Evil One (Satan) has gained the mastery over them, so he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah; they are Satan's Party; now surely the Satan's Party are the losers.
Lo! Those who oppose (or resist) Allah and His Messenger; they shall be among the most abased.
Allah has decreed, "I will most certainly prevail, I and My Messengers"; surely Allah is Strong, Almighty.
You shall not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those who oppose (or resist) Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their own fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kinsfolk; these are they into whose heart He has impressed faith, and whom He has strengthened with a Spirit from Him: and He will cause them to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein; Allah is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. They are Allah's Party. Truly, it is the Party of Allah who are the successful.
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth declares the glory of Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
He it is Who caused those of the followers of the Book who disbelieved to go forth from their homes at the first exile. You did not think that they would go forth, while they were certain that their fortresses would defend them against Allah; but Allah came to them whence they did not expect, and cast terror into their heart. They demolished their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers; therefore take a lesson, O you who have eyes!
And had it not been that Allah had decreed for them the exile, He would certainly have punished them in this world, and in the Hereafter they shall have chastisement of the Fire.
That is because they acted in opposition to Allah and His Messenger, and whoever acts in opposition to Allah, then surely Allah is severe in retribution.
Whatever palm-tree you cut down or leave standing upon its roots, It is by Allah's command, and that He may abase (or confound) the transgressors.
And whatever Allah bestowed (as advantage or booty) on His Messenger from them, you did not press forward against it any horse or riding camel but Allah gives authority to His Messengers against whom He wills, and Allah has power over all things.
Whatever Allah has bestowed (as advantage or booty) to His Messenger from the people of the towns, it is for Allah and for the Messenger, and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, so that it may not be a thing taken by turns among the rich of you, and whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it, and from whatever he forbids you, keep back, and be careful of your duty to Allah; surely Allah is severe in retribution.:
It is for the poor who fled their homes and their possessions, seeking the grace of Allah and His good pleasure, and assisting Allah and His Apostle: these it is that are the sincere.
And those, who had homes in the city (Madina) and in the faith before them, love those who have fled to them, and do not find in their heart a need of what they are given, and give them (the fugitives) preference before themselves, though poverty may afflict them. Whoever is preserved from the avarice of his own soul, these it is that are the successful ones.
And those who came after them say, "Our Lord! Forgive us and those of our brethren who preceded us in the faith, and leave not in our heart any spite (or rancour) towards those who believe. Our Lord! Surely you are Kind, Merciful."
Have you not seen those who have become hypocrites? They say to those of their brethren who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book (the Jews), "If you are driven forth, we shall certainly go forth with you, and we will never obey any one against you, and if you are attacked, we will certainly help you." Allah bears witness that they are most surely liars.
Certainly, if these are driven forth, they will not go forth with them, and if they are fought against, they will not help them; and even if they help-them, they will certainly turn their backs, then they shall not be helped.
Truly, You are a greater source of terror than Allah in their heart (or you are greater than them because of the terror in their heart sent by Allah); that is because they are a people who do not understand
They will not fight against you in a body save in fortified towns or from behind walls; strong is the conflict among themselves. You may think them one body, but their heart are divided; that is because they are a people devoid of sense.
Like those who preceded them lately, they tasted the evil result of their affair, and theirs is a painful punishment.
They are like the devil when he says to man, "Disbelieve." But when he disbelieves, he says, "I am surely free of you; surely I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds."
Therefore the end of them both is that they are in the Fire to abide therein, and that is the reward of the wrongdoers.
O you who believe! Fear (or be careful of your duty to) Allah, and let every soul consider what it has sent on for the morrow, and fear (or be careful of your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is Aware of what you do.
And be not like those who forgot (or forsook Allah), so He made them forget (or forsake) their own souls: these it is that are the transgressors.
Not alike are the inmates of the Fire and the dwellers of the Garden: the dwellers of the Garden are they that are the successful (or achievers or victorious).
Had We sent down this Quran on a mountain, you would certainly have seen it falling down (humbled), splitting asunder because of the fear of Allah, and We set forth these parables to men that they may reflect.
He is Allah besides Whom there is no God; the Knower of the unseen and the seen; He is the Beneficent, the Merciful
He is Allah, besides Whom there is no God; the Sovereign King, the Holy, the Giver of Peace (Satisfaction and Perfection), the Keeper of Faith, The Guardian (or Preserver of Security), the Majestic (or Exalted in Might), the Compeller (or Irresistible), the Superb. Glory be to Allah above all that they set up (with Him).
He is Allah the Creator, the Originator (or Maker out of naught), the Fashioner; His are the Most Beautiful Names; whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares His glory; and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
O you who believe! Take not My enemy and your enemy for friends: would you offer them love (or friendship) while they deny what has come to you of the truth, driving out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah, your Lord? If you go forth striving in My path and seeking My pleasure, would you manifest love to them? And I know what you conceal and what you manifest; and whoever of you does this, he indeed has gone astray from the Straight Way.
If they should get the upper hand over you, they will be your enemies, and will stretch forth towards you their hands and their tongues with evil intent, and they ardently desire that you may disbelieve.
Your relationship would not profit you, nor your children on the Day of Resurrection; He will decide between you; and Allah sees what you do. 
Indeed, there is for you a good example in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people, "Surely we are clear of you and of what you serve besides Allah; we have rejected you, and enmity and hostility have appeared between us and you forever until you believe in Allah alone. But not in what Abraham said to his father, "I will pray forgiveness for you, but I control nothing for you from Allah." (They prayed,) "Our Lord! On Thee do we rely, and to Thee do we turn repentant, and to Thee is our final goal.
"Our Lord! Do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord! Surely you are the Mighty, the Wise."
Certainly there is for you in them a good example, for him who fears Allah and the Last Day; and whoever turns back, then surely Allah is the Absolute (or Self-sufficient), the Praise-worthy.
It may be that Allah will bring about friendship between you and those whom you now hold to be your enemies among them; and Allah is Powerful; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah does not forbid you respecting those who have not made war against you on account of your religion, and have not driven you forth from your homes, that you show them kindness and deal with them justly; surely Allah loves the doers of justice.
Allah only forbids you respecting those who made war upon you on account of your religion, and drove you forth from your homes and backed up others in your expulsion, that you make friends with them, and whoever makes friends with them, these are the unjust.
O you who believe! When believing women come to you fleeing (as refugees), then examine (or test) them; Allah knows best their faith. If you find them to be believing women, do not send them back to the unbelievers. Neither are they lawful (wives) for them, nor are they lawful (husbands) for them. But pay them what they have spent (as dower); and no blame attaches to you in marrying them on payment of their dowries. But hold not to the ties of unbelieving women. Ask for what you have spent for them, and let them ask for what they have spent. That is Allah's judgment; He judges between you, and Allah is Knowing, Wise.
And if any of your wives deserts you unto the disbelievers and afterwards you have your turn (the coming over of a woman from the other side), give to those whose wives have deserted them the equal of what they have spent (on their dower), and be careful of your duty to Allah in Whom you believe.
O Prophet! When believing women come to you giving you a pledge that they will not associate aught with Allah, and will not steal, and will not commit fornication, and will not kill their children, and will not bring a calumny which they have forged of themselves, and will not disobey you in what is good, accept their pledge, and ask forgiveness for them from Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you who believe! Do not make friends with a people with whom Allah is wroth; indeed they despair of the Hereafter as the unbelievers despair of those in the graves.
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth declares the glory of Allah; and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do?
It is most hateful to Allah that you should say that which you do not do.
Surely Allah loves those who fight (or strive) in His way in ranks as if they were a firm and compact wall.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people! Why do you vex me, though you know that I am the Messenger of Allah to you?" But when they turned away, Allah made their heart go astray, and Allah does not guide transgressing people.
And when Jesus son of Mary said, "O children of Israel! Surely I am the messenger of Allah to you, verifying that which is before me in the Torah and giving the Good News (Gospel) of a Messenger who will come after me, his name being Ahmad." But when he came to them with clear arguments they said, "This is clear sorcery."
And who does greater wrong (or is more unjust) than he who forges a lie against Allah when he is invited to the Surrender (Islam), and Allah does not guide the unjust people.
They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light, though the unbelievers may be averse.
He it is Who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may make it overcome all religions, though the polytheists may be averse.
O you who believe! Shall I lead you to an affair (or a transaction) which may deliver you from a painful doom?
You shall believe in Allah and His Messenger, and strive hard in Allah's way with your property and your lives; that is better for you, did you but know!
He will forgive you your faults and cause you to enter into Gardens, beneath which rivers flow, and goodly Mansions in Gardens of Eternity; that is the supreme achievement (or triumph);
And yet another blessing (will He bestow) that you love: - help from Allah and a speedy victory; so give good news to the believers.
O you who believe! Be helpers of Allah, as Jesus son of Mary said to his disciples, "Who are my helpers of Allah?" The disciples said, "We are helpers of Allah." So a party of the children of Israel believed and another party disbelieved; then We strengthened those who believed against their enemy, and they prevailed (or became the uppermost).
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth declares the glory of Allah, the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise.
He it is Who raised among the Unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, who recites to them His revelations and makes them grow (or purifies or sanctifies them), and teaches them the Book and the Wisdom, although they were before certainly in clear error,
And others from among them who have not yet joined them (future converts); and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
That is Allah's grace; He grants it to whom He pleases, and Allah is the Lord of mighty Grace.
The similitude of those who were charged with the Law of Moses, then they did not observe it, is as the similitude of the ass bearing books. Evil is the likeness of the people who reject the revelations of Allah; and Allah does not guide wrongdoing people.
Say, "O you who are Jews, if you think that you are the favourites of Allah to the exclusion of other people, then invoke death if you are truthful."
And they will never invoke it because of what their hands have sent before; and Allah is Aware of the unjust.
Say, "The death from which you flee, that will surely overtake you, then you shall be sent back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you of that which you used to do."
O you who believe! When the call is made for prayer on Friday, then hasten to the remembrance of Allah and abandon trading; that is better for you, if you know.
But when the prayer is ended, then disperse abroad in the land and seek the Bounty of Allah, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful.
And when they see merchandise (bargains or business) or sport (amusement) they break up for it, and leave you standing. Say, "That which is with Allah is better than sport and better than merchandise, and Allah is the best of Sustainers."
When the hypocrites come to you, they say, "We bear witness that you are most surely Allah's Messenger; Allah knows that you are most surely His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars.
They make their oaths a screen (for their misdeeds), and thus turn away from Allah's way; surely evil is that which they do.
That is because they believe, then disbelieve, so a seal is set upon their heart so that they do not understand.
And when you see them, their persons will please you, and if they speak, you will listen to their speech; they are like big pieces of wood clad with garments. They think every cry to be against them. They are the enemy, therefore beware of them; the curse of Allah be on them. How perverted they are!
And when it is said to them, "Come, the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you", they turn back their heads and you may see them turning away while they are inflated with pride.
It is alike to them whether you beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them; Allah will never forgive them; surely Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
They it is who say, "Do not spend upon those who are with the Messenger of Allah." hoping that they will disperse (or break up). But to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, and the hypocrites understand not.
They say, "If we return to Medina, the mighty will surely drive out the weaker there from; but Might belongs to Allah, and to His Messenger and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not.
O you who believe! Let not your wealth, or your children, divert you from the remembrance of Allah; and whoever does that, these are the losers.
And spend out of what We have given you before death comes to any of you, lest he should say, "My Lord! Why did you not respite me for a little while longer, so that I could have given alms and been of the doers of good deeds?"
But Allah grants not respite to a soul when its appointed term has come and Allah is Aware of what you do.
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth declares the glory of Allah; to Him belongs the kingdom, and to Him is due all praise, and He has power over (or to do) all things.
He it is Who created you, but one of you is an unbeliever and another of you is a believer; and Allah sees what you do.
He created the heavens and the earth with Truth, and He formed you, then made goodly your forms, and to Him is the final goal.
He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you hide and what you manifest; and Allah is Aware of what is in the heart.
Has there not come to you the story of those who disbelieved in olden times, then tasted the evil consequences of their conduct, and they had a painful doom?
That is because there came to them their messengers with clear arguments, but they said, "Shall mortals guide us? So they disbelieved and turned their backs; but Allah is independent of them, and Allah is Absolute (Self-sufficient), the Owner of Praise.
Those who disbelieve think that they shall never be raised up (for Judgment). Say, "Aye! By my Lord! You shall most certainly be raised; then you shall most certainly be informed of what you did; and that is easy to Allah."
Therefore, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Light which We have revealed; and Allah is Aware of what you do.
On the day that He will gather you on the Day of Gathering, that is the day of loss and gain; and whoever believes in Allah and does good, He will remove from him his evil and cause him to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever; that is the Supreme Achievement (or Triumph).
And those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations, they are the inmates of the fire, to abide therein and evil is the destination.
No affliction comes about but by Allah's permission; and whoever believes in Allah, He guides aright his heart; and Allah is Aware of all things.
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger, but if you turn back, then the duty of Our Messenger is only to deliver the Message openly and clearly.
Allah! There is no Allah but He; and upon Allah, then, let the believers put their trust.
O you who believe! Surely from among your wives and your children there are some who are enemies to you; therefore beware of them; but if you forgive and forbear and efface, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Your possessions and your children are only a trial, and Allah it is with Whom is a great reward.
Therefore, keep your duty to Allah as much as you can, and hear and obey and spend, it is better for your souls; and whoever is saved from the greediness of his soul, these it is that are the successful.
If you set apart for Allah a goodly portion, He will double it for you and forgive you; and Allah is the Responsive, Forbearing,
The Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty, the Wise.
O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their prescribed time, and calculate the number of the days prescribed, and be careful of your duty to Allah, your Lord. Do not drive them out of their houses, nor should they themselves go forth, unless they commit an open lewdness. These are the limits of Allah, and whoever goes beyond the limits of Allah, he indeed does injustice to his own soul. You do not know that Allah may after that brings about a new situation.
So when they have reached their prescribed time, then take them back with kindness or part with them with kindness; and call to witness two men of justice from among you, and give upright testimony for Allah. With that is admonished he who believes in Allah and the Last Day; and whoever is careful of his duty to Allah, He will make for him a way out,
And give him sustenance from whence he thinks not; and whoever puts his trust in Allah, He is sufficient for him. Surely Allah attains His purpose; Allah has appointed a measure for all things.
And as for those of your women who have despaired (passed the age) of menstruation, if you have a doubt, their prescribed time shall be three months, and of those too who have not had their courses. As for the pregnant women, their prescribed time is that they bring forth their burden (give birth); and whoever is careful of their duty to Allah He will make easy for him his path.
That is the command of Allah which He has revealed to you, and whoever is careful of his duty to Allah, He will remove from him his evil and give him a big reward.
Lodge them where you lodge according to your means, and do not injure them in order that you may harass (or distress) them; and if they are pregnant, spend on them until they lay down their burden (give birth); then if they suckle for you, give them their recompense and consult together in kindness according to what is just and reasonable; and if you find (or make) difficulties, let another (woman) suckle (the child) on his (the father's) behalf.
Let him who has abundance spend out of his abundance and whoever has his means of subsistence restricted, let him spend out of that which Allah has given him; Allah does not lay on any soul a burden beyond that which He has granted it; Allah brings about after difficulty, ease.
And how many a community rebelled against the commandment of its Lord and His Messengers, so We called it to account severely and We chastised it with a stern chastisement.
So it tasted the evil result of its conduct, and the end of its affair was perdition.
Allah has prepared for them severe chastisement, therefore be careful of your duty to Allah, O men of understanding who believe! Allah has indeed revealed to you a reminder,
A Messenger who recites to you the clear revelations of Allah so that he may bring forth those who believe and do good deeds from darkness into light; and whoever believes in Allah and does good deeds, He will cause him to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever. Allah has indeed given him a goodly sustenance.
Allah is He Who created seven heavens, and of the earth the like of them. The Commandment continues to descend among them slowly, that you may know that Allah has power over all things and that Allah indeed encompasses all things in knowledge.
O Prophet! Why do you ban (or forbid) that which Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives; but Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Allah has ordained for you the dissolution of your oaths (under certain circumstances) and Allah is your Protector, and He is the Knowing the Wise.
And the prophet communicated a piece of confidential information to one of his wives, but when she divulged it to another, Allah made it known to him. He confirmed part of it and denied part of it. Then when he informed her of it, she said, "Who told you of this?" He said, "He told me Who is the Knower, the Aware of all things."
If you both turn in repentance to Him, your heart are already inclined to this; and if you back each other up against him, then surely Allah it is Who is his Protector, and Gabriel and every righteous one among the believers, and furthermore, the angels, are his supporters.
Maybe, if he divorce you, His Lord will give him in your stead wives better than you, who surrender their self-will (to Allah or His Messenger), who believe (or have faith), who are devoted (or pious, devout), who turn in repentance, who travel (or strive) for faith and fast (or abstain), widows or virgins.
O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones; over it are angels stern and strong, they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, and they do precisely as they are commanded.
(It will be said,) "O you who disbelieve! Make no excuses this day; you shall be rewarded only according to what you did."
O you who believe! Turn to Allah a sincere repentance; maybe your Lord will remove from you your evil and cause you to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow, on the Day on which Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with him; their light shall run on before them and on their right hands. They shall say, "Our Lord! Make perfect for us our light, and grant us protection, surely you have power over all things."
O Prophet! Strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be hard against them; and their abode is Hell; and evil is the destination.
Allah sets forth an example to those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot: they were both under two of Our righteous servants, but they were false towards them so they (the husbands) availed them naught against Allah, and it was said, "Enter you the Fire with those (others) who enter it.
And Allah sets forth an example, to those who believe, in the wife of Pharaoh when she said, "My Lord! Build for me a house near Thee in the Garden and deliver me from Pharaoh and his doing, and save me from the evil doing people."
And Mary, the daughter of Imran, whose body was chaste (or who guarded her chastity), so We breathed into her of Our Spirit and she testified the truth of the Words of her Lord and His revelations, and she was of the obedient.
Blessed is He in Whose hand is the Sovereignty, and He has power to do all things,
Who created death and life that He may try you as to which of you is best in conduct; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving,
Who created the seven heavens one above the other in harmony; you see no incongruity in the creation of the Beneficent Allah; then look again, can you see any flaw?
Then turn back your eye again and again; your sight will return unto you weak and fatigued.
And certainly We have adorned this lower heaven with lamps and We have made these missiles for Satan, and We have prepared for them the chastisement of burning.
And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of hell, and evil is the destination.
When they shall be cast therein, they shall hear a loud gasp as it swells,
Almost bursting for fury. Whenever a group is cast into it, its keeper shall ask them, "Did there not come to you a Warner?"
They shall say, "Yea! Indeed there came to us a Warner, but we rejected him and said, 'Allah has not revealed anything, you are only suffering from delusions.'"
And they shall say, "Had we but listened or pondered (used our reason or intelligence), we should not have been among the inmates of the Blazing Fire."
So they shall acknowledge their sins, but far will be forgiveness from the inmates of the Blazing Fire.
Lo! Those who fear their Lord in secret (or unseen), they shall surely have forgiveness and a great reward.
And whether you conceal your opinion or express it; surely He is Aware of what is in the heart.
Should He not know, He Who created? And He is the Knower of the Subtleties, the Aware.
He it is Who made the earth smooth (manageable) for you, therefore go about in the spacious paths thereof, and eat of His provisions, and to Him is the Resurrection after death.
Have you taken security from Him Who is in heaven that He will not make the earth swallow you when it is shaken (convulsed)?
Or have you taken security from Him Who is in heaven that He will not send down upon you a hurricane so that you shall know how terrible was My warning?
And verily those before them rejected the truth, then how terrible was My wrath.
Have they not seen the birds above them expanding (their wings) and contracting (them)? What is it that withholds them save the Beneficent? Lo! He is Seer of all things.
Or who is it that will be an army to assist you besides the Beneficent? The unbelievers are in naught but delusion.
Or who is it that will provide you if He should withhold His sustenance? Nay! They persist in disdain and aversion (from truth).
What! Is he who goes prone upon his face better guided or he who walks upright upon a Straight Way?
Say, "He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the faculties of hearing and seeing and heart: little is it that you give thanks."
Say, "He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered."
And they say, "When shall this promise be (fulfilled) if you are truthful?"
Say, " The knowledge thereof is only with Allah and I am only a plain Warner."
But when they shall see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve shall be sorry, and it shall be said, "This is that which you used to call for."
Say (O Muhammad), "Have you considered if Allah should cause me and those with me to be destroyed or has mercy on us, still, who will protect the disbelievers from a painful doom?"
Say, "He is the Beneficent. We believe in Him and in Him do we put our trust. And you will come to know who it is that is in error manifest."
Say, "Have you considered if all your water should some morning be lost down into the earth, who is it then that will supply you clear flowing water?"
NUN. I swear by the Pen and by that which they write,
By the grace of your Lord you (Muhammad) are not mad (or stupid, deluded or possessed).
And most surely you shall have a reward unfailing.
And most surely you have the most sublime (or exalted) character.
Soon will you see, and they too shall see,
Which of you is afflicted with madness (stupidity or delusion).
Surely your Lord best knows him who errs from His way, and He best knows the followers of the right guidance.
So do not yield to the rejecters.
They desire that you should be pliant (or compromise) so they too would be pliant (compromise).
And yield not to any mean swearer
Defamer, going about with slander 
Hinderer (obstructer) of good, transgressor beyond limits, malefactor,
Ignoble (violent, cruel and greedy), besides all that, base-born (inherently degenerate);
Because he possesses wealth and sons.
When Our communications are recited to him, he says, "Stories of those of old".
We will brand him on the snout.
Surely We will try them as We tried the people of the garden, when they resolved to cut the produce in the morning,
And were not willing to set aside a portion (for the poor).
Then there encompassed it (the garden) a visitation from your Lord while they were sleeping.
So it became as black, barren land.
And they called out to each other in the morning (unaware of what had happened),
Saying, "Go early to your tilth if you would cut the produce."
So they went, while they murmured to each other secretly,
Saying, "Let no poor man enter it today besides you."
And in the morning they went, strong in this (evil) resolve.
But when they saw it (the garden), they said, "Most surely we have gone astray.
"Nay! We are made to suffer privation."
The best of them said, "Did I not say to you, 'Why not glorify (Allah)?'"
They said, "Glory be to our Lord, surely we were unjust."
Then some of them advanced against others, blaming each other.
Said they, "O woe to us! Surely we were outrageous transgressors:
"Maybe, our Lord will give us instead a garden better than this; lo! We beseech (or turn in repentance to) our Lord."
Such is the chastisement, and certainly the chastisement of the Hereafter is even greater, did they but know!
Surely those who guard against evil shall have with their Lord Gardens of Delight.
What! Shall We then treat those who have Surrendered (in Islam) as those who are guilty?
What ails you? How do you judge?
Or have you a Book wherein you learn,
That you shall have through it whatever you choose?
Or have you received from Us an agreement, confirmed by an oath, extending until the Day of Resurrection, that you shall have what you demand?
Ask them which of them will vouch for that,
Or have they associates (in the Godhead); then let them produce them if they are truthful.
On the day when the Shin (the Hidden Mystery or Truth) shall be laid bare, and they shall be called upon to make obeisance, but they shall not be able,
Their looks cast down, abasement shall overtake them seeing that they had been called upon to make obeisance indeed while yet they were safe.
So leave Me and him who rejects this Announcement (The Message of Muhammad); We will overtake them by degrees, from whence they perceive not:
Yet I do bear with them, for lo! My plan is firm.
Or do you ask from them a reward, so that they are burdened with debt?
Or have they the knowledge of the unseen, so that they write it down?
So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, and be not like the Companion of the Fish (Jonah), when he cried while he was in distress.
Were it not that favour from his Lord had reached him, he would certainly have been cast down upon the naked shore while he was blameworthy.
Then his Lord chose him, and He made him of the righteous.
And those who disbelieve would almost smite you with their eyes when they hear the Reminder (Quran), and they say, "Most surely he is mad (or possessed).
And it is naught but a reminder to creation (or all the worlds).
The sure Reality!
What is the sure Reality? 
And what would make you realize what the sure Reality is?
Thamud and A'ad called the Stunning Calamity (the Day of Judgment) a lie.
But the Thamud, they were destroyed by the Storm of thunder and lightening.
And the A'ad, they were destroyed by a roaring, violent wind.
Which He made to prevail against them for seven nights and eight days unremittingly, so that you might have seen the people therein prostrate as if they were the trunks of hollow palms.
Do you then see any of them remaining?
And Pharaoh and those before him and the overthrown cities (Sodom and Gomorrah) continuously committed sins.
And they disobeyed the Messengers of their Lord, so He punished them with a severe punishment.
Surely We bore you (mankind) up in the Ark when the water rose high,
So that We may make it a reminder to you, and that the retaining ear might retain it (in memory).
And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast,
And the earth and the mountains are borne away and crushed with a single crushing.
On that day shall the Great Event come to pass,
And the heaven shall cleave asunder, so that on that Day it shall be frail, 
And the angels shall be on the sides thereof; and above them eight shall bear the Throne of their Lord that Day.
On that day you shall be exposed to view, no secret of yours shall remain hidden.
Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say, "Here! Read my book:
"Surely I knew that I shall meet my account."
So he shall be in a life of Bliss,
In a lofty garden,
The fruits of which are near at hand:
Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did beforehand in the days gone by.
And as for him who is given his book in his left hand he shall say, "O would that my book had never been given me:
"And I did not know how my account stood:
"O would that it (death) had made an end of me:
"My wealth has availed me nothing:
"My authority has perished away from me."
(The command is given) "Seize him, and chain him,
"Then cast him into the burning Fire,
"Then march him tied to a chain the length of which is seventy cubits.
"Surely he did not believe in Allah, the Great,
"Nor did he urge the feeding of the poor.
"Therefore he has not here today a true friend,
"Nor any food except filth,
"Which none but the wrongdoers eat." 
But nay! I swear (or call to witness) by that which you see,
And that which you do not see.
Most surely, it is the Word brought by an honoured Messenger,
And it is not the word of a poet; little is it that you believe;
Nor the word of a soothsayer; little is it that you mind.
It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
And if he had fabricated against Us some of the sayings,
We would certainly have seized him by the right hand,
Then We would certainly have severed his life-artery.
And not one of you could have withheld Us from him.
And verily, it is a reminder for those who guard against evil.
And verily, We know that some of you are rejecters.
And verily, it is a source of great grief to the unbelievers.
And verily, it is the Truth of Certainty.
Therefore-glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High.
A questioner asked about the chastisement which must befall
The unbelievers, which none can avert,
From Allah, the Lord of the Ascending Stairways.
To Him ascend the angels and the Spirit in a Day the measure of which is fifty thousand years.
Therefore endure with a goodly patience.
Surely they think it to be far off,
And We see it nigh.
On the day when the heaven shall be as molten copper
And the mountains shall be as tufts of wool
And friend shall not ask of friend
Though they shall be given sight of each other. The guilty one would fain redeem himself from the chastisement of that day by sacrificing his children,
And his wife and his brother
And the nearest of his kinsfolk who gave him shelter,
And all those that are in the earth, hoping to be delivered.
By no means! Surely it is a flaming Fire
Dragging him right to his skull,
It calls him who turned and fled from truth,
And amasses wealth then locks it up.
Surely man is created anxious (or impatient)
Fretful when evil afflicts him
And niggardly when good befalls him
Except those who pray -
Those who are constant (or devoted) at their prayer
And those in whose wealth there is a fixed portion
For him who begs and for him who is destitute
And those who accept the truth of the Day of Judgment
And those who are fearful of the displeasure of their Lord, - 
Surely the displeasure of their Lord is a thing before which none can feel secure (or is the opposite of peace and tranquillity) - 
And those who guard their chastity,
Except in the case of their wives or those whom their right hands possess - for on these surely is no blame,
But he who seeks to go beyond this, these it is that transgress beyond bounds - 
And those who are faithful to their trusts and their covenant
And those who are upright in their testimonies,
And those who keep guard (the sacredness of) their worship,
Those shall be in Gardens, honoured.
But what ails those who disbelieve that they rush around you (Muhammad) open-eyed (in mock amazement),
On the right hand and on the left, in sundry groups?
Does every man of them desire that he should be made to enter the Garden of Bliss?
By no means! Surely We have created them of what they know (earth and spirit).
But nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the Lord of all points of the rising and setting places East and West that We are certainly Able
To replace them with others better than them, and We shall not be overcome.
Therefore leave them alone to go on with the false discourses and to sport until they come face to face with that Day of theirs with which they are warned;
The Day on which they shall come forth from their graves in haste, as if they were racing to a goal,
Their eyes cast down; disgrace shall overtake them; that is the Day which they were promised.
Lo! We sent Noah to his people, saying, "Warn your people before there come upon them a painful doom."
He said, "O my people! Surely I am a plain Warner to you:
"That you should serve Allah and be careful of your duty to Him and obey me:
"He will forgive you some of your faults and grant you a delay for an appointed term; surely the term of Allah when it comes is not postponed; did you but know?
He said, "O my Lord! Surely I have called my people by night and by day!
"But my call has only increased their flight (from truth):
"And whenever I have called them that you may forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, cover themselves with their garments, grow obstinate and puffed up with pride:
"So I called to them aloud:
"And lo! I have made public proclamations unto them, and I have appealed to them in private:
"And I have said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord, surely He is the most Forgiving:
 71:11."'He will send down upon you an abundance of rain:
"'And help you with wealth and sons, and bestow on you gardens, and bestow on you rivers.
"'What ails you that you fear not the greatness of Allah?
"'Seeing that He has created you through various stages.
"'Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens, one above another (or in harmony),
"'And made the moon therein a light, and made the sun a lamp?
"'And Allah has made you out of the earth as a gradual growth:
"'Then He returns you to it, and then will He bring you forth a new bringing forth:
"'And Allah has made for you the earth a wide expanse,
"' That you may go about in it in spacious paths (or valleys).'"
Noah said, "My Lord! Surely they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children have added to him nothing but loss.
"And they devised a mighty plot.
"And they say (to each other), 'By no means leave your gods, abandon neither Wadd, nor Suwa, nor Yaghut, and Yauq and Nasr (their gods).'
"And indeed they have led astray many, and do not increase the unjust in aught but error.
Because of their wrongs they were drowned, then made to enter Fire, so they did not find any helpers besides Allah.
And Noah said, "My Lord! Leave not upon the land any dweller from among the unbelievers:
"For surely if you leave them they will lead astray Thy servants, and will not beget any but immoral, ungrateful ones."
"My Lord! Forgive me and my parents and him who enters my house believing, and the believing men and the believing women; and do not increase the unjust in aught but perdition!
Say, "It has been revealed to me that a company of the jinn listened, and they said, "Surely we have heard a wonderful Recital (Quran),
"Guiding to the right way. So we believe in it, and we will not join any one with our Lord (in worship):
"And that He, exalted be the majesty of our Lord, has not taken a consort, nor a son:
"The foolish amongst us used to invent extravagant things against Allah:
"And lo! We thought (or think) that men and jinn did not (or ought not to) utter a lie against Allah:
"And, indeed, persons from among men used to seek refuge with persons from among jinn, so they increased them in wrongdoing (or folly or revolt):
"And they thought as you think, that Allah would not raise anyone (to be judged):
"And we sought to reach heaven, but we found it filled with strong guards and flaming fires (or meteors).
"And we used to sit in some high hidden places therein to steal a hearing, but he who would try to listen now would find a flame lying in wait for him:
"We know not whether evil is meant for those who are on earth or whether their Lord means to bring them good:
"And some of us are righteous and others of us are far from that: we are sects following different ways:
"But we know that we cannot escape (or frustrate) Allah in the earth, nor can we escape (or frustrate) Him by flight:
"And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it (or accepted it); whoever believes in his Lord, he neither fears loss nor oppression (injustice or disgrace):
"Some of us are those who have Surrendered (to Allah), and some of us are deviators. Those who have Surrender have surely taken the right path purposefully.
"As for the deviators, they are the fuel of Hell:"
If they should keep to the right way, We would certainly give them to drink of abundant water,
"So that We might test them therewith. And whoever turns aside from the remembrance of his Lord, He will afflict him with a severe penalty.
The places of worship are only Allah's, therefore call not upon any one along with Allah:
And yet when the servant of Allah stood up in prayer to Him, they crowded almost stifling him.
Say, "I only call upon my Lord, and I do not associate any one with Him."
Say, "I do not control for you evil or good."
Say, "Surely no one can protect me against Allah, nor can I find besides Him any place of refuge
 72:23."Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His messages; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger surely he shall have the fire of Hell to abide therein for ever.
Until when they see what they are promised, then shall they know who it is that is weaker in helpers and fewer in number.
Say, "I do not know whether that which you are promised be nigh or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term: 
He is the Knower of the unseen! And He reveals unto none His secrets,
Except messengers whom He has chosen; and then He makes a guard to go before him and after him,
So that He may know that they have truly delivered the messages of their Lord. He encompasses what is with them and He keeps count of all things.
O you wrapped up in your garment!
Rise to pray in the night except a little (or but not all night), 
Half of it, or lessen it a little,
Or add to it, and recite the Quran as it ought to be recited.
Surely We will make to light upon you (charge you with) a weighty Word (or message).
Surely the vigil of the night is the most potent for the soul (to receive impressions) and the best for framing speech (or the Words of prayer).
Surely you have in the daytime a long occupation (with ordinary affairs of life).
And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with exclusive (and wholehearted) devotion.
(He is) The Lord of the East and the West - there is no God but He - therefore, take Him for a protector.
And bear patiently what they say and avoid them with a becoming avoidance (or leave taking).
And leave Me to deal with the rejecters, the possessors of ease and plenty, and bear with them a little.
Surely with Us are heavy fetters and a raging fire,
And food that chokes and a painful doom,
On the day when the earth and the mountains shall quake and the mountains shall become (as) heaps of running sand.
Surely We have sent unto you a Messenger, a witness against you, as We sent a Messenger to Pharaoh.
But Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger, so We seized him with a violent grip.
How, then, will you guard yourselves, if you disbelieve, on the day which shall make children grey-headed (with stress)?
The heaven shall rend asunder thereby; His promise is ever brought to fulfilment.
Surely this is a reminder, let then him, who will, take the way to his Lord.
Your Lord does know that you stand in prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half of it, and sometimes a third of it, and so also do a party of those with you; and Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are not able to keep count thereof, so He has turned to you in mercy. Therefore read what is easy of the Quran. He knows that there must be among you sick, and others who travel in the land seeking of the bounty of Allah, and others who fight in Allah's way, therefore read as much of it as is easy unto you, and keep up regular prayer and pay the poor-rate and lend to Allah a goodly loan, and whatever of good you send on beforehand for your souls, you will find it in the presence of Allah; yea, better and greater in reward; and seek forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
O you enveloped in your cloak!
Arise and warn,
And magnify your Lord,
And your cloak do purify,
And uncleanness do shun,
And bestow not favours that you may receive again with increase,
And for the sake of your Lord, be patient.
For when the trumpet is sounded,
That, at that time, shall be a Day of distress,
Far from easy for the unbelievers.
Leave Me alone to deal with him whom I created,
And gave vast riches,
And sons to be by his side,
And I adjusted the affairs of life to go smoothly and appropriately for him; 
And yet he desires that I should add more!
By no means! For lo! He stubbornly opposes Our revelations.
Will impose on him a fearful doom.
Surely he reflected and then plotted,
But woe to him for how he plotted!
Again, woe to him for how he plotted!
Then he looked around,
Then he frowned and scowled,
Then he turned back and was inflated with pride,
Then he said, "This is naught but enchantment, narrated of olden days;
"This is naught but the word of a mortal."
Soon will I cast him into the burning (Hell-fire).
And what will make you understand what the burning (Hell-fire) is?
It leaves naught, it spares naught.
It scorches (darkens the colour) and shrivels the mortal.
Over it are nineteen.
And We have not made the wardens of the fire others than angels, and We have not made their number but as a trial for those who disbelieve, that those who have been given the Book (scriptures) may be certain and those who believe may increase in faith, and those who have been given the Book and the believers may not doubt, and that those in whose heart is a disease and the unbelievers may say, "What does Allah mean by this parable?" Thus does Allah make err whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills, and none knows the hosts (or forces) of your Lord but He Himself; and this is naught but a reminder to the mortals.
Nay; I swear by (or call to witness) the moon,
And by the night when it departs,
And by the Dawn when it shines forth;
Surely, this is but one of the mighty Signs,
A warning to mortals,
To him among you who wishes to go forward or remain behind.
Every soul is held in pledge for its own deeds,
Except the people of the right hand,
In Gardens, they shall ask each other
And ask the guilty,
"What has brought you into hell?"
They shall say, "We were not of those who prayed;
"And we used not to feed the poor;
"And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who entered into vain discourses.
"And we used to call the Day of Judgment a lie;
"Till the inevitable event (death) overtook us."
The intercession of no mediators shall avail them then.
What is then the matter with them that they turn away from the admonition,
As if they were frightened asses 
Fleeing from a lion?
Nay; every one of them desires that he may be given pages spread out (or open);
Nay! But they do not fear the Hereafter.
Nay! This surely is an admonition.
Let any who will, pay heed (or remember).
But none will remember (or heed) unless Allah wills. He is the source of fear (or righteousness) and the source of Mercy.
Nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the Day of Resurrection.
Nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the self-accusing soul.
Does man think that We shall not gather his bones?
Yea! We are able to make complete his very fingertips
Nay! Man desires to give the lie to what is before him.
He asks, "When is the day of resurrection?"
So when the sight becomes dazzled,
And the moon becomes dark,
And the sun and the moon are brought together,
Man shall say on that day, "Whither can I flee for refuge?"
By no means! There shall be no place of refuge!
With your Lord alone shall on that day be the place of rest.
Man shall on that day be informed of what he sent before and what he put off.
Nay! Man is telling evidence against himself,
Though he puts forth his excuses.
Move not your tongue with it (the Quran) to make haste with it,
Surely it is for Us to collect it and to recite (or enact) it.
Therefore when We have recited it, follow its recitation.
Nay, more, it is for Us to explain (and clarify) it.
Nay! But you do love the fleeting Now,
And neglect the Hereafter.
Some faces on that Day shall be bright,
Looking to their Lord.
And other faces on that Day shall be gloomy,
Knowing that there will be made to befall them some great calamity.
Nay! When the soul comes up to the throat,
And it is said, "Who will be a magician (to restore him)?
And he is sure that it is the time of parting
And one leg will be tied to another (i.e. after death);
To your Lord on that day shall be the driving.
So he did not accept the truth, nor did he pray,
But called the truth a lie and turned back,
Then he went to his folk, arrogant.
Nearer unto you and nearer (comes the doom),
Again, nearer unto you and nearer (comes the doom).
Does man think that he is to be left to wander aimless (or purposeless)?
Was he not a small seed in the seminal elements,
Then he was a clot of blood, so He created (him) then made (him) perfect.
Then He made of him two kinds, the male and the female.
Is not He able to give life to the dead?
Was there not over man a long period of time when he was a thing unremembered (nothing, not worth mention).
Surely We have created man from a small mingled life-germ; in order to try him, We made him hearing and seeing.
Surely We have shown him the way: he may be thankful or unthankful.
Surely We have prepared for the unbelievers chains and yokes and a burning fire.
Surely the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor,
A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink, flows with abundance.
Because they fulfil their vows and fear a day the evil of which spreads far and wide.
And they give food out of love for Allah to the poor and the orphan and the captive:
(Saying) We only feed you for Allah's sake; we desire from you neither reward nor thanks:
Surely we fear from our Lord a stern, distressful day.
Therefore Allah will deliver them from the evil of that day and will shed on them the Light of Beauty and Joy;
And reward them, because they were patient, with a Garden and garments of silk,
Reclining therein on raised couches, they shall find therein neither the severe heat of the sun nor intense cold.
And shade thereof is close upon them, and clustered fruits thereof bow down.
And amongst them shall be passed vessels of silver and goblets of crystal,
(Transparent as) glass but made of silver; they will determine the measure thereof.
And they will be given to drink therein a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil,
From a fountain therein named Salsabil.
And they will be served by youths never altering in age; when you see them you will think them to be scattered pearls.
And when you look, you will see blessings and a magnificent kingdom.
Upon them will be garments of fine green silk and gold brocade, and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a drink pure and holy.
Lo! This is a reward for you, and your striving has been recognised and accepted.
Lo! We, even We have revealed the Quran to you in stages.
Therefore wait patiently for the command of your Lord, and obey not from among them one who is guilty or ungrateful.
And glorify the name of your Lord morning and evening.
And during part of the night adore Him, and glorify Him a long part of the night.
But they love the transitory life and put away behind them (ignore the remembrance of) a grievous Day.
We, even We created them and made firm their frame, and when We will We will replace them, bringing others like them in their stead.
Surely this is an admonition; whoever will, let him take a straight path to his Lord.
But you will not, except as Allah wills, surely Allah is Knower, Wise;
He makes whom He will enter into His mercy; and for evildoers, He has prepared a painful doom.
I swear by (or call to witness) the emissary winds sent one after another for men's benefit,
By the raging hurricanes,
Which scatter things far and wide,
And separate things one from another,
Then I swear by the angels who bring down the revelation (or message),
To clarify or to warn.
Most surely what you are promised must come to pass.
So when the stars are made dim,
And when the heaven is rent asunder,
And when the mountains are carried away as dust,
And when the messengers are gathered at their appointed time
To what Day are these signs appointed?
To the Day of Decision.
And what will make you comprehend what the day of decision is?
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
Did We not destroy the former generations?
Then did We follow them up with later ones.
Even thus shall We deal with the guilty.
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
Did We not create you from a fluid regarded contemptible?
Which We laid in a safe abode (the womb),
Till an appointed term?
Thus We arrange things - how well are We at arranging things.
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
Have We not made the earth draw together to itself,
The living and the dead,
And placed therein lofty mountains, and given you to drink sweet water from them?
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
Go on to that which you used to deny!.
Go on to the smoke with three branches (or three fold shadow),
Neither having the coolness of the shade nor availing against the flame.
Surely it sends up sparks like palaces,
As if they were tawny camels.
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
This is the day on which they shall not speak,
Nor are they permitted to make excuses (or pleas).
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
This is the Day of Decision: We have gathered you and those of yore.
So if you have a plan, plan against Me now.
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
Surely those who guard against evil shall be amid shades and fountains,
And fruits such as they desire.
Eat and drink pleasantly because of what you did.
Surely thus do We reward the doers of good.
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; surely you are guilty.
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
And when it is said to them, "Bow down (in humility), they bow not. 
Woe on that day to the rejecters.
In what announcement, then, after this, will they believe?
Of what do they question one another?
About the Great News, 
About which they are in disagreement?
Verily, they shall soon come to know
Verily, verily, they shall soon come to know.
Have We not made the earth an expanse?
And the mountains as projections (thereon)?
And created you in pairs?
And made your sleep for rest?
And made the night to be a covering?
And made the day for livelihood and activity? 
And made above you seven firmaments (heavens)?
And placed therein a shining lamp (the Sun)?
And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance,
That We may bring forth thereby corn and vegetable,
And gardens dense and luxuriant?
Surely the Day of Decision (or Sorting ) is a thing appointed:
The day on which the trumpet shall be blown so you shall come forth in hosts,
And the heaven shall be opened as if it were all doors,
And the mountains shall be moved off so that they shall remain a mere semblance.
Surely hell lies in ambush,
A destination for those who transgress the bounds,
Abiding therein for ages.
They shall not taste therein anything cool nor drink
But boiling and intensely cold water,
Requital corresponding (or proportional to their state).
Surely they feared not the account,
And called Our revelations a lie with strong denial.
And We have preserved all things in a Record.
"So taste you (the fruits of your deeds)! For We will not add to you aught but torment.
Surely for the righteous is achievement (or success, self-fulfilment),
Gardens and vineyards,
And those showing freshness of youth, equals in age,
And a pure cup.
They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying.
A reward from your Lord, a gift according to reckoning (or sufficient):
From the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Beneficent Allah, with whom none can argue.
The day on which the Spirit and the angels shall stand arrayed; they speak not except him whom the Beneficent permits and who speaks aright.
That is the Day of Certain Reality, so whoever desires may take refuge with his Lord.
Surely We have warned you of a doom near at hand: the day when man shall see that which his two hands have sent before, and the unbeliever shall say, "O! Would that I were dust!"
I swear by (or call to witness) those who tear out to destruction,
And by those rushing.
And by those who float,
Then press forward as in a race,
And those who regulate affairs.
The day on which the first trump resounds (or that which can quake shall quake),
And others follow it.
Hearts on that day shall palpitate,
While eyes are cast down.
They say, "Shall we indeed be restored to our first state?
"What! When we are rotten bones?"
They said, "That then would be a return, causing loss."
But it shall be only a single cry, 
When lo! They will be fully awake.
Has not there come to you the story of Moses?
When his Lord called upon him in the holy valley of Tuwa,
(Saying,) "Go to Pharaoh, surely he has transgressed beyond bounds."
Then say, "Have you a desire to purify yourself?
"And I will guide you to your Lord so that you may fear."
So he showed him the Mighty Sign.
But he (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed.
Then turned he away (from Allah) in haste.
Then he gathered (men) and made a proclamation.
Saying, "I am your Lord, the most high."
So Allah seized him with the punishment of the Hereafter and the former life.
Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears.
Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He created it.
He raised high its height, and gave it order and perfection.
And He made dark its night and its splendour does He bring out with light.
And after that He expanded (spread) the earth.
He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage.
And the mountains, He made them firm,
A provision for you and for your cattle.
But when the great overwhelming calamity comes;
The Day on which man shall recollect all he strove after,
And Hell shall be made manifest to him who sees
Then for him who has transgressed all bounds,
And prefers the life of this world,
Surely, Hell will be his abode.
And as for him who had feared standing in the presence of his Lord and restrains his soul from lust (or low desires),
Then surely the Garden, that is his abode.
They ask you (Muhammad) about the Hour, when it will come.
"What," ask they, "have you to say about it?"
To your Lord belongs the knowledge of it.
you are only a Warner to him who would fear it.
On the day that they behold it, it will be as though they had not tarried but an evening or the morning.
He frowned and turned his back,
Because there came to him the blind man.
And what would make you know that he would grow (spiritually)
Or that he might become heedful so that the reminder should profit him?
As for him who considers himself independent (or self-sufficient),
To him do you attend. 
Yet no blame is on you if he grow not (spiritually).
And as to him who comes to you striving earnestly,
And with the fear of Allah in his heart,
From him were you unmindful (or distracted).
Nay! Verily, it is an admonishment (or a message of instructions).
So let whoever will pay heed to it.
It is in honoured books,
Exalted, purified,
Set down by scribes
Noble and righteous.
Cursed (self-destroyed) is man! How ungrateful (to Allah) is he!
Of what stuff did He create him?
Of a small seed; He created him, then gave him due proportions,
Then He made his way easy for him,
Then He causes him to die and buries him in his grave,
Then when He wills, He will raise him to life again.
Nay; but man has not done that which He bade him.
Then let man consider his food,
That We pour down the water in abundance,
Then We cleave the earth,
Then We cause to grow therein the grain,
And grapes and clover,
And the olive and the palm,
And dense luxurious gardens,
And fruits and herbage
A provision for you and for your cattle.
But when the Deafening Noise (cataclysm) comes,
The Day on which a man shall fly from his brother,
And his mother and his father,
And his spouse and his children, 
Every man of them shall on that Day be occupied with concerns which will make him heedless of others.
Many faces on that Day shall be bright as dawn (or beaming with light),
Laughing, rejoicing.
And many faces on that Day, shall be covered with dust,
Veiled in darkness.
These are the disbelievers, the wicked.
When the sun is overthrown (or folded up),
And when the stars darken,
And when the mountains pass away,
And when the she-camels (with young) are left untended,
And when the wild beasts are herded together
And when the seas swell and boil,
And when souls are sorted and reunited,
And when the female infant buried alive is asked
For what sin she was killed,
And when the Record Books are spread open,
And when the heavens are unveiled,
And when Hell is kindled up,
And when the Garden is brought nigh,
Every soul shall then know what it has prepared.
But nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the Planets,
That run their course and hide themselves,
And the Night when it departs,
And the Dawn when it breaths away the darkness,
Most surely it is the Word of an honourable Messenger,
The possessor of power and high rank with the Lord of the Throne,
One to be obeyed, and faithful to his trust.
And your companion is not one possessed (or mad).
And of a truth he saw himself on the clear horizon.
Nor is he a tenacious concealer of the unseen.
Nor is it the word of the cursed Satan,
Whither then will you go?
It is naught but a reminder unto all creation (or all the worlds),
For him among you who wills to go straight.
And you will not, unless Allah wills, the Lord (or Cherisher) of Creation (or all the Worlds).
When the heavens are cleft asunder,
And when the stars are dispersed,
And when the oceans are suffered to burst forth,
And when the graves are overturned,
Every soul shall know what it has sent before and held back.
O man! What has beguiled you from your Lord, the Gracious one,
Who created you, then completed your form in due proportions, then gave you balance (or an inclination to reason and justice)?
Into whatever form He wills He castes you.
Nay! But you deny the judgment, 
And most surely there are guardians over you
Honourable recorders,
They know what you do.
Verily, the righteous are in bliss,
And verily, the wicked are in burning fire,
They shall enter it on the Day of Judgment. 
And they shall by no means be absent from it.
And what will convey unto you what the Day of Judgment is?
Again, what will convey unto you what the Day of Judgment Is?
The day on which no soul shall control anything for another soul; and the command on that day shall be entirely Allah's.
Woe to the defrauders,
Who, when they take the measure of their dues from men take it fully,
But when they give by measure or weight, they are deficient.
Do not these think that they shall be raised again to account
On a Mighty Day,
The day on which men shall stand before the Lord of the Worlds?
Nay! Most surely the record of the wicked is in Sijjin.
And what will explain to you what Sijjin is?
It is an inscribed Record.
Woe on that day to the rejecters,
Who give the lie to the Day of Judgment.
And none deny it but the transgressors beyond bounds, the sinful one
When Our revelations are recited to him, he says, "Stories of those of yore."
Nay! But what they used to do has become like rust upon their heart.
Nay! Most surely they shall on that day be debarred (or veiled) from their Lord.
Then most surely they shall enter the burning Fire.
Then shall it be said, "This is what you gave the lie to."
Nay! Most surely the record of the righteous shall be in Iliyin.
And what will explain to you what Iliyin is?
It is an inscribed Record,
Those who are drawn near to Allah shall witness it.
Most surely the righteous shall be in bliss,
On thrones, they shall gaze;
You will see in their faces the brightness of bliss.
They are given to drink pure wine, sealed.
The sealing of it is with musk; and for that let the aspirers aspire.
And the admixture of it is a water of Tasnim,
A fountain from which drink they who are nearest to Allah.
Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who believe.
And when they passed by them, they winked at one another.
And when they returned to their own folk they returned exulting.
And when they saw them, they said, "Most surely these are truly astray".
But they were not sent to be keepers over them.
This day it is the believers who shall laugh at the unbelievers;
On thrones (of dignity), they will gaze.
Are not the disbelievers rewarded for what they did?
When the heaven is rent asunder
And gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful!
And when the earth is stretched out 
And casts forth what is within it, and is emptied (or clean), 
And gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful!
O man! Verily, you are toiling on towards your Lord, painfully toiling; wherefore shall you meet Him!
And as for him who is given his record in his right hand, 
His account shall be taken with an easy reckoning; 
And he shall go back to his people rejoicing.
But as for him who is given his book behind his back,
He shall call out for destruction, 
But he shall broil in a blazing Fire! 
Verily, he was amongst his family joyful. 
Verily, he thought that he should never return to Allah.
Nay, nay! Verily, his Lord did watch him!
So I do call as witness the glow of sunset,
Or the night, and its homing,
Or the moon in her fullness,
You shall surely travel from stage to stage!
What ails them that they believe not? 
And, when the Quran is read to them, they fall not prostrate? 
On the contrary, the unbelievers reject it.
But Allah knows best the (malice) that they hide.
So announce to them the grievous woe! 
Save those who believe and work right. For them is an unfailing reward.
By the heaven with its zodiacal signs!
And by the Promised Day!
And by the witnesses and the witnessed!
Self-destroyed were the owners of the pit;
The fire of which was supplied with abundant fuel,
Behold, they sat over it,
And they witnessed all they were doing against the believers.
And they mistreated them only for their belief in Allah, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy,
Whose are the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth; for Allah is Witness over all!
Verily, those who persecute (or mislead or tempt) the believers, men and women, and then do not repent, for them is the penalty of Hell: they will have the torment of the burning Fire!
Verily, those who believe and do right, for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow: that is the great bliss!
Verily, strong is the power of your Lord!
Verily, it is He who creates and restores,
And He is the Forgiving, the Loving, 
The Lord of the Glorious Throne; 
The Doer of what He will!
Has there come to you the story of the Hosts 
Of Pharaoh and the Thamud?
Yet the unbelievers persist in rejecting (the truth);
But Allah is behind them - encompassing!
Nay, this is a glorious Quran,
(Inscribed) in a Preserved Tablet.
By the heaven and by the night or (morning) star!
And what shall make you know what the night star is? 
The star of piercing brightness.
Verily, every soul has a guardian over it.
Then let man look from what he is created! 
He is created from a drop emitted
Which comes out from between the loins and the breast bones.
Surely, He is able to bring back (to life), 
On the day when the secrets shall be tried, 
And man shall have neither strength nor helper.
By the Firmament which returns in its rounds,
And the earth with its sprouting!
Verily, this is indeed a discriminating word, 
And it is no frivolity!
As for them, they do plot a scheme!
But I plot my scheme too!
So give respite to the unbelievers; deal you gently with them for a while.
Glorify the name of your Guardian Lord most High,
Who created and makes order and proportion,
Who ordains Laws and Guides, 
Who brings forth the pasture, 
Then turns it to dusky stubble! 
We will teach you by degrees to declare (or recite), and you shall not forget,
Save what Allah wills. Verily, Lo! He knows the open and the hidden; 
And We will ease your way into the simple (path);
Therefore, remind men, for, verily, the reminder is useful.
But he who fears will be mindful; 
And the wretch will avoid it; 
He will broil in the great Fire, 
Wherein he shall neither die nor live!
He is successful who grows,
And remembers the name of his Lord and prays!
Nay! But you prefer the life of this world, 
Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
Verily, this was in the former books,
The books of Abraham and Moses.
Has the story reached you, of the overwhelming?
Some faces on that day shall be humbled, 
Toiling, weary, 
While they broil upon a burning Fire; 
While they drink from a boiling spring! 
No food shall they have save from the bitter Dhari, 
Which shall not nourish nor avail against hunger!
Other faces on that day shall be joyful, 
Content with their past endeavours,
In a lofty (sublime) Garden
Wherein they shall hear no foolish word;
Wherein is a flowing fountain; 
Wherein are Thrones (of dignity) raised on high, 
And goblets set down ready, 
And cushions arranged, 
And carpets spread!
Do they not look then at the camel, how she is created?
And at the heaven how it is raised high?
And at the mountains how they are set firm?
And at the earth how it is spread out?
Therefore, remind them: for you are only one to remind; 
you are not in authority over them; 
But such as turns his back and disbelieves, 
Him will Allah punish with the greatest torment.
Verily, unto us is their return, 
And, verily, for Us is their accounting!
I swear by (or call to witness) the dawn
And by the nights twice five (of pilgrimage)!
And the even and the odd!
And the night when it passes on!
Is there not in these a lesson (evidence or admonition) for a man of understanding?
Have you not seen how your Lord did with the people of A'ad?
With the city of Iram of the lofty pillars? 
The like of which has not been created in all the land?
And with the people of Thamud when they hewed the great stones in the valley?
And with Pharaoh, Lord of the stakes?
All these were outrageous in the land, 
And did multiply wickedness therein, 
Therefore, your Lord poured out upon them the scourge of diverse torments.
Verily, your Lord is ever watchful! 
Now as for man, whenever his Lord tries him and honours him and grants him favour, then he says, "My Lord has honoured me"; 
But whenever he tries him and restricts his subsistence, then he says, "My Lord despises me!"
Nay, nay! But you do not honour the orphan, 
Nor do you urge each other to feed the poor, 
And you devour the inheritance (of the weak) with greed,
And you love wealth with an abounding love!
Nay, when the earth is crushed to pieces, 
And your Lord comes with the angels, rank on rank, 
And Hell is brought near on that Day, on that Day shall man remember! But how shall the remembrance profit him?
He will say, "Would that I had sent something forward for my life!"
But on that Day none shall punish as He punishes,
And none shall be bound with bonds like his!
But O, you soul in peace and fulfilment!
Return unto your Lord, well pleased and well pleasing unto Him!
Enter you amongst My servants,
Enter you My Garden (Paradise)!
I swear (or call to witness) this City (Mecca), 
And you (Muhammad) are a dweller of this City!
And the (mystic ties) of Parent and Child!
We have surely created man in suffering (struggle, trouble, sorrow).
Does he think that none has power over him?
He says, "I have squandered wealth in plenty;"
Does he think that no one sees him?
Have We not made for him two eyes 
And a tongue, and two lips? 
And guided him in the two highways?
But he has not attempted the ascent!
And what will explain to you the ascent?
It is freeing captives (or prisoners, slaves, the restricted or bound), 
Or feeding on the day of privation, 
An orphan who is a kin, 
Or a destitute lying in the dust (of misery); 
And again (it is) to be of those who believe and encourage each other to patience, and encourage each other to mercy,
These are the fellows of the right!
But those who disbelieve in our signs, they are the fellows of the left, 
For them is the enclosing Fire!
By the sun and its noonday brightness!
And the moon when it follows him!
And the day when it displays him!
And the night when it covers him!
And the wondrous structure of the heavens and Him who built it!
And the earth and Who spread it!
And the soul and Who fashioned it, 
And enlightened it with what is wrong and right for it!
He indeed is successful who causes it to grow (or purifies it)!
And he indeed is a failure who corrupts it!
The Thamud people denied (the Messenger) in their rebellious pride (or outrage), 
When the basest of them rose up 
And the Messenger of Allah (Salih) said to them, "(This is) Allah's she-camel! So give her to drink."
But they called him a liar, and they ham-strung her; so their Lord destroyed them in their sins, and served them all alike;
And He fears not the result thereof!
By the night when it veils!
And the day when it is displayed!
And by (the mystery) of male and female!
Verily, your efforts are diverse!
But as for him who gives alms and fears Allah,
And believes in goodness,
We will ease his way to ease!
But as for him who is niggardly and thinks himself independent (or self-sufficient),
And calls the good a lie,
We will ease his way to misery (adversity)!
And his wealth shall not avail him when he falls down (into hell)!
Verily, it is for Us to guide;
And, verily, Ours are the Latter and the Former life!
Therefore, I have warned you of a Fire that flames fiercely!
None shall broil thereon, but the most wretched, 
Who says it is a lie and turns his back.
But the pious shall be kept away from it, 
He who gives his wealth that he may grow.
And who gives no favour expecting a return,
But only desiring the face of his Lord Most High.
In the end he shall be well fulfilled!
By the glorious morning light!
And the night when it is still!
Your Lord has not forsaken you (Muhammad), nor is displeased with you!
And surely the Hereafter is better for you than the present; 
And in the end your Lord will give you, and you shall be well pleased!
Did He not find you an orphan, and give you protection? 
And find you wandering (or astray), and guide you ? 
And find you in need, and enriched you (or made you independent)?
Therefore, the orphan oppress him not; 
Nor the beggar (or petitioner) drive away,
And as for the favour of your Lord, discourse (proclaim) thereof.
Have We not expanded for you your breast?
And set down from you your load
Which galled your back? 
And exalted for you your renown?
Verily, with difficulty comes ease!
Verily, with difficulty comes ease!
So when you are at relieved, then still toil,
And to your Lord turn all your yearning (or attention)!
By the Fig and the Olive!
And by Mount Sinai!
And by this Safe City!
Surely, We have created man in the best of moulds. 
Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low;
Save those who believe and act right; for theirs is a reward unfailing.
But what shall make you call the judgment after this a lie?
Is not Allah the most wise (just or conclusive) of judges?
READ (or proclaim), in the name of your Lord! Who created
Created man from a clot!
Read (or proclaim), for your Lord is most Bountiful!
Who teaches by the pen!
Taught man what he did not know!
Nay, verily, man is indeed rebellious
In that he thinks himself independent (or self-sufficient or rich)!
Verily, unto your Lord is the return!
Have you considered him who forbids?
A servant when he prays?
Have you considered if he were in guidance 
Or bade piety?
Have you considered if he denied the truth, and turned his back?
Does he not know that Allah can see?
Nay, surely, if he does not desist, We will drag him by the forelock!
The lying sinful forelock!
So let him call his council (or comrades):
We will call the guards of Hell!
Nay, obey him not, but adore and draw nigh (unto Allah)!
Verily, We sent it (the Quran) down on the Night of Power!
And what shall make you know what the Night of Power is?
The Night of Power is better than a thousand months!
The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by the permission of their Lord with every decree.
Peace it is until the rising of the dawn!
Those of the People of the Book and the idolaters who disbelieve did not fall away until there came to them the Manifest Sign -
A Messenger from Allah reading pure pages 
Wherein are right scriptures:
Nor did those who were given the Book divide into sects until after there came to them the Manifest Sign.
But they were bidden nothing but to worship Allah, being sincere in religion unto Him as 'Hanifs', and to be steadfast in prayer, and to give alms: for that is the true religion.
Verily, those who disbelieve amongst the people of the Book and the idolaters shall be in the fire of hell, to dwell therein for aye; they are wretched creatures!
Verily, those who believe and act aright, they are the best of creatures; 
Their reward with their Lord is Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; Allah shall be well pleased with them, and they with Him! That is for him who fears his Lord!
When the earth shall be shaken with its quaking!
And the earth shall bring forth her burdens, 
And man shall say, "What ails her!"
On that day she shall tell her tidings,
Because your Lord inspires her.
On the day when men shall come up in separate bands to show their works: 
And he who does the weight of an atom of good shall see it then! 
And he who does the weight of an atom of evil shall see it!
By the snorting chargers!
And those who strike fire with their hoofs!
And those who make incursions in the morning,
And raise up dust therein,
And cleave through a host therein!
Verily, man is to his Lord ungrateful; 
And, verily, he is a witness of that.
Verily, he is keen in his love of wealth.
Does he not know when the tombs are exposed,
And what is in the breasts is brought to light?
Verily, your Lord upon that day indeed is well aware.
The calamity!
What is the calamity?
And what will convey to you what the calamity is?
The day when men shall be like scattered moths;
And the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool! 
And as for him whose balance is heavy, 
He shall be in a well-pleasing life.
But as for him whose balance is light, 
His mother will be the Bereft and Hungry One.
And who shall convey to you what she is? - 
A raging fire!
The rivalry in worldly increase deludes you
Till you visit the graves!
Nay! In the end you shall know! 
And again Nay! In the end you shall know!
Nay! Did you but know with certain knowledge!
You shall surely see hell! 
And again you shall surely see it with an eye of certainty.
Then you shall surely be asked about pleasure!
By the declining day!
Verily, man is in a state of loss, 
Save those who believe and do good works, and bid each other to truth, and bid each other endurance.
Woe to every slanderous scandal-monger and backbiter, 
Who collects wealth and counts it. 
He thinks that his wealth can immortalize him.
Not so! He shall be hurled into El'Hutamah!
Ah, what shall make you understand what El'Hutamah is? 
The Fire by Allah kindled; 
Which leaps into the heart.
Lo! It closes in as a vault on them 
In outstretched columns.
See  you not how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant?
Did He not make their stratagem lead them astray, 
And sent down on them birds in flocks, 
To pelt them with stones of baked clay,
And make them like stalks left by herbage eaten down?
For the taming (civilizing) of the Qureysh;
Their covenant covers their caravans in winter and summer.
So let them serve the Lord of this house
Who feeds them against hunger, and makes them safe against fear?
Have you considered him who calls the judgment (or Religion) a lie?
He it is who pushes the orphan away; 
And urges not (others) to feed the needy.
But woe to those who pray 
But are careless in their prayers,
Who pretend for show
Yet withhold small kindnesses (or necessaries).
Verily, We have given you (Muhammad) El Kauthar (The Fountain of Abundance);
So pray to your Lord and sacrifice.
Verily, he who insults you shall be issueless (cut off).
Say, "O you faithless!
I do not serve what you serve;
Nor will you serve what I serve; 
Nor will I serve what you serve; 
Nor will you serve what I serve;
To you your Way and to me my Way!"
When there comes Allah's help and victory,
And you shall see men enter into Allah's religion in crowds
Then celebrate the praises of your Lord, and ask forgiveness of Him, verily, He is Relenting!
Perish shall the hands of The Father of Flame, and he shall perish!
His wealth shall not avail him, nor what he has gained!
He shall soon broil in a Fire that flames, 
And his wife shall carry the wood as fuel.
On her own neck a cord of palm fibres.
Say, "He is Allah, the One and Only.
Allah the  Absolute,  on whom all things depend, besought by all!
He begets not and is not begotten!
Nor is there like unto Him any one!"
Say, "I seek refuge in the Lord of the Dawn,
From the evil of created things; 
And from the evil of the night when it cometh on;
And from the evil of those who practice secret arts;
And from the evil of the envious when he envies."
Say, "I seek refuge in the Lord and Cherisher of mankind,
The King (or Ruler) of mankind, 
The God (or Judge) of mankind, 
From the mischief of the Whisperer, who slinks off,
Who whispers into the heart of men!
From among Jinn and Men!"
